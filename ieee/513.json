This type of controller has its simplicity in parallelism to conventional generalized predictive control design and efficiency to deal with complex nonlinear dynamics. A mathematical model using RWNN is constructed, and a learning algorithm adopting a recursive least squares is employed to identify the unknown parameters in the consequent part of the RWNN. The proposed control law is derived based on the minimization of a modified predictive performance criterion. Two theorems are presented for the conditions of the stability analysis and steady-state performance of the closed-loop systems. Numerical simulations reveal that the proposed control gives satisfactory tracking and disturbance rejection performances. Experimental results for position control of a positioning mechanism show the efficacy of the proposed method with setpoint changes.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2025714","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5200775/05130069.pdf","startPage":"3733","endPage":"3742","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2025714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Application of Stable Predictive Controller Using Recurrent Wavelet Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5130069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design and Application of Stable Predictive Controller Using Recurrent Wavelet Neural Networks","volume":"56","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10816639","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5130069/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Application of Stable Predictive Controller Using Recurrent Wavelet Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tie-lu-2025714.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10095S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5200775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5200775","articleId":"5130069","onlineDate":"26 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5130124,"authors":[{"name":"Rae-Young Kim","affiliation":["Future Energy Electronics Center, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5200775/5130124/5130124-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rae-Young Kim (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 1997 and 1999, respectively.

This paper includes the study, design, and implementation of a Rogowski-coil current sensor without the integrator circuit that is typically used. The circuit includes an autotuning block able to adjust to different motor speeds. Equalizing the amplitudes of the fundamental and fault harmonics leads to higher precision current measurements. The resulting compact sensor is used as a current probe for fault detection in induction motors through motor current signal analysis. The use of a Rogowski coil without an integrator allows a better discrimination of the fault harmonics around the third and fifth main harmonics. Finally, the adaptive conditioning circuit is tested over an induction machine drive. Results are presented, and quantitative comparisons are carried out.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5238769/05130237.pdf","startPage":"4062","endPage":"4070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2025715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2025715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238769","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5130237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motor Fault Detection Using a Rogowski Sensor Without an Integrator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Electrical fault detection","Circuit faults","Induction motors","Circuit testing","Current measurement","Probes","Signal analysis","Coils","Induction machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","induction motor drives","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motor fault detection","Rogowski sensor","current acquisition system","current sensor","fault harmonics","adaptive conditioning circuit","motor current signal analysis","induction machine drives"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current sensor","motor current signal analysis (MCSA)","motor drive","Rogowski"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5130237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Motor Fault Detection Using a Rogowski Sensor Without an Integrator","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5130237/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869398","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motor Fault Detection Using a Rogowski Sensor Without an Integrator","sourcePdf":"tie-romeral-2025715.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073864S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5238769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5238769","articleId":"5130237","onlineDate":"26 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5130240,"authors":[{"name":"Jiachun Guo","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jiachun","lastName":"Guo","id":"37576787800"},{"name":"Yong Fu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Fu","id":"37286601700"},{"name":"Zuyi Li","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Zuyi","lastName":"Li","id":"37291773500"},{"name":"Mohammad Shahidehpour","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Shahidehpour","id":"37272476200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"5130240","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":89,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3073},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"abstract":"Line outage distribution factors (LODFs) are utilized to perform contingency analyses in power systems.

In this study, we introduce an iterative sparse-representation-based algorithm for detection of voxels in functional MRI (fMRI) data with task relevant information. In each iteration of the algorithm, a linear programming problem is solved and a sparse weight vector is subsequently obtained. The final weight vector is the mean of those obtained in all iterations. The characteristics of our algorithm are as follows: 1) the weight vector (output) is sparse; 2) the magnitude of each entry of the weight vector represents the significance of its corresponding variable or feature in a classification or regression problem; and 3) due to the convergence of this algorithm, a stable weight vector is obtained. To demonstrate the validity of our algorithm and illustrate its application, we apply the algorithm to the Pittsburgh Brain Activity Interpretation Competition 2007 functional fMRI dataset for selecting the voxels, which are the most relevant to the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tasks</i>\n of the subjects. Based on this dataset, the aforementioned characteristics of our algorithm are analyzed, and a comparison between our method with the univariate general-linear-model-based statistical parametric mapping is performed. Using our method, a combination of voxels are selected based on the principle of effective/sparse representation of a task. Data analysis results in this paper show that this combination of voxels is suitable for decoding tasks and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voxel Selection in fMRI Data Analysis Based on Sparse Representation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2025866","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5238786/05130241.pdf","startPage":"2439","endPage":"2451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2025866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238786","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5130241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5130241/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Voxel Selection in fMRI Data Analysis Based on Sparse Representation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5130241/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869321","pubMedId":"19567340","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voxel Selection in fMRI Data Analysis Based on Sparse Representation","sourcePdf":"tbme-li-2025866.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114338S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5238786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5238786","articleId":"5130241","onlineDate":"26 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5130249,"authors":[{"name":"Murat Ceylan","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik Muhendisligi Bolumu, Selcuk Universitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Ceylan","id":"37842443200"},{"name":"Yuksel Ozbay","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik Muhendisligi Bolumu, Selcuk Universitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Yuksel","lastName":"Ozbay","id":"37327939100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3605-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3606-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5130249","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Electrocardiography","Quantization","Video coding","Decoding","Parity check codes","Rate-distortion","Layout","Humans","Face"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","electrocardiography","medical signal processing","neural nets","signal classification","statistical analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex wavelet transform","ECG classification","arrhytmia","complex-valued ANN","artificial neural network","statistical features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ECG","Complex wavelet transform","CVANN"]}],"abstract":"In this study, a new structure formed by complex wavelet transform (CWT) with different levels and complex-valued artificial neural network (CVANN) is proposed for classification of ECG arryhytmias.

Many studies on different techniques about this topic have been made in the last 20 years. ANN (Artificial Neural Network) is the tool that is mostly used in medical diagnosis systems because of the belief in its powerful prediction characteristics. However, the suggested ANN architectures in literature are very complex software-based architectures. Consequently, these models with high computational complexity can only be run on expensive processors. To enable the implementation of ANN models on mobile and cheap devices, the features of ECG signal, which are applied to ANN inputs, should be reduced. This approach enables the implementation of a simple ANN architecture. In this study, the features of ECG signal are reduced dramatically using PCA (Principle Component Analysis), while keeping the error of the ANN learning rate at an acceptable level such as 5%. As a result, a simple Matlab ANN model, which consists of eight inputs, a hidden layer with two neurons and one output neuron, is implemented on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) by using IEE 754 32 bits floating-point numerical representation.","publicationTitle":"2009 14th National Biomedical Engineering Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 14th National Biomedical Engineering Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075164/5130246/05130253.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIYOMUT.2009.5130253","doi":"10.1109/BIYOMUT.2009.5130253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5130246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based arrhythmia classifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based arrhythmia classifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5130253/","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10746348","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based arrhythmia classifier","confLoc":"Izmir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1A5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042859S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2009","isNumber":"5130246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075164","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5130253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5130273,"authors":[{"name":"Didar Talat","affiliation":["Bilgisayar Muhendisligi Bolumu, Bogazici Universitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Didar","lastName":"Talat","id":"38193218000"},{"name":"Albert Guvenis","affiliation":["Bilgisayar Muhendisligi Bolumu, Bogazici Universitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Guvenis","id":"37330257500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3605-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3606-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5130273","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5130273","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Spatial resolution","Solid scintillation detectors","Positron emission tomography","Mathematical model","MATLAB","Linearity","Radioactive decay","Mammography","Crystals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","mammography","neural nets","position sensitive particle detectors","positron emission tomography","scintillation counters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","positioning algorithm","positron emission mammography detector","LSO scintillation crystal","Anger algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BIYOMUT.2009.5130273","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075164/5130246/05130273.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 14th National Biomedical Engineering Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 14th National Biomedical Engineering Meeting","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5130246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIYOMUT.2009.5130273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network based positioning algorithm for PEM imaging","abstract":"The objective of this work is to improve the resolution and linearity of a positron emission mammography (PEM) detector using a continuous LSO scintillation crystal, by using an algorithm based on artificial neural networks.

The main reason for the stroke is the emboli which are particles bigger than red blood cells. Emboli can be detected by Doppler ultrasound. Embolic Doppler ultrasound signals are short duration transient like signals. These signals can be obtained from in-phase and quadrature-phase parts of the quadrature Doppler signals as forward and reverse signals by using the phase relationship between in-phase and quadrature-phase signals. Discrete wavelet transform is one of the methods used for analyzing these signals. A desired property in discrete wavelet transform is phase shift-invariance which can not be provided by ordinary discrete wavelet transform. To overcome this disadvantage dual-tree complex wavelet transform was introduced. But Doppler signals are dual channel signals and dual-tree complex wavelet transform must be applied twice. Therefore complexity of the transform increases. In this work, a new transform method reducing computational complexity is introduced.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new wavelet transform method for processing Doppler signals","publicationTitle":"2009 14th National Biomedical Engineering Meeting","doi":"10.1109/BIYOMUT.2009.5130279","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 14th National Biomedical Engineering Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075164/5130246/05130279.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIYOMUT.2009.5130279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5130246","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5130279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5130279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new wavelet transform method for processing Doppler signals","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5130279/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10746371","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new wavelet transform method for processing Doppler signals","confLoc":"Izmir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"2B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043449S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075164","isNumber":"5130246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075164","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5130246","articleId":"5130279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5130280,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Today the most important method used by the medical doctors in diagnosing the disorders in connection with the heart is listening with the stethoscope. The sounds created by the flow of the blood entering the heart and movements of the valvular connected to the flow are listened and then the abnormalities related to the heart are determined. On the other hand, the method of listening with the stethoscope has many constrains. In this study, from the heart sounds taken from the patient via electronic stethoscope digital data have been acquired, and with the discrete Fourier transform, which is one of the signal processing methods, frequency analysis has been performed, and both sound graphic and frequency spectrum have been displayed on the pocket computer. Thus, examining the frequency spectrum of the normal and abnormal heart sounds, it is thought that the differences on the frequency axis of the normal and abnormal sounds may be beneficial in diagnosing. Because unlike normal heart sounds, the diseased heart sounds taken from a patient who has any kind of heart disorder include higher frequency components. As the developed system can be operated in a mobile way, it is appropriate for the medical doctors to use it in clinical practically.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 14th National Biomedical Engineering Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075164/5130246/05130280.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 14th National Biomedical Engineering Meeting","doi":"10.1109/BIYOMUT.2009.5130280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIYOMUT.2009.5130280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5130246","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5130280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performing discrete fourier transform of the heart sounds on the pocket computer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Heart","Frequency","Stethoscope","Medical diagnostic imaging","Humans","Blood","Acoustic signal processing","Digital signal processing","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","bioacoustics","biomedical electronics","cardiology","discrete Fourier transforms","haemodynamics","medical disorders","medical signal processing","notebook computers","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transform","heart sound","pocket computer","medical doctors","medical disorder","electronic stethoscope digital data","signal processing method","frequency analysis","sound graphics","frequency spectrum","blood flow"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heart sounds","Electronic stethoscope","Digital signal processing","Discrete Fourier Transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5130280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performing discrete fourier transform of the heart sounds on the pocket computer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5130280/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10732767","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performing discrete fourier transform of the heart sounds on the pocket computer","confLoc":"Izmir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"2B4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073124S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075164","isNumber":"5130246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075164","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5130246","articleId":"5130280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5130286,"authors":[{"name":"Berat Dogan","affiliation":["Elektrik - Elektronik Fak\u00fcltesi, Istanbul Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Berat","lastName":"Dogan","id":"37085673643"},{"name":"Mehmet Korurek","affiliation":["Elektrik - Elektronik Fak\u00fcltesi, Istanbul Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Korurek","id":"37352944100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3605-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3606-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5130286","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radial basis function networks","Electrocardiography","Performance evaluation","Testing","Neural networks","Heart rate variability","Spatial databases","Feature extraction","Artificial neural networks","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","radial basis function networks","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radial basis function neural network training","ECG beat classification","RBFNN","premature ventricular contraction","atrial premature beat","right bundle branch blok beat","MIT-BIH arrhythmia database","time-domain feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ECG","Radial Basis Function Neural Network","ANN","classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5130286","abstract":"In this study radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) was trained by different methods to study performance of each method on classification of ECG beats.

We tested the imaging performance of coarrays with different sampling schemes on the simulated point spread functions of original and control coarray sets. Simulation results show equivalent performance in 40 dB for an annular ring array of 64 elements with 2049 original and 350 reduced sets.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Ultrasonic imaging","Neodymium","Catheters","Data acquisition","Image reconstruction","Array signal processing","Frequency","Testing","Signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","blood vessels","data acquisition","image motion analysis","image reconstruction","image sampling","medical image processing","ultrasonic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coarray sampling method","intravascular ultrasound imaging","catheter size","data acquisition","image reconstruction","synthetic phased array processing","motion artifact","spatial frequency component","point spread function","IVUS imaging","annular ring array"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BIYOMUT.2009.5130318","publicationTitle":"2009 14th National Biomedical Engineering Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 14th National Biomedical Engineering Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075164/5130246/05130318.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5130246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIYOMUT.2009.5130318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coarray sampling methods for forward looking IVUS imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5130318","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coarray sampling methods for forward looking IVUS imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5130318/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5130318/","accessionNumber":"10746405","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coarray sampling methods for forward looking IVUS imaging","confLoc":"Izmir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"5A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038855S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075164","isNumber":"5130246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075164","xplore-issue":"5130246","articleId":"5130318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5130363,"authors":[{"name":"Metin Yildiz","affiliation":["Biyomedikal Muhendisligi Bolumu, Bilkent Universitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Metin","lastName":"Yildiz","id":"38238003600"},{"name":"Derya Yilmaz","affiliation":["Teknik Bilimler Meslek Yuksekokulu, Bilkent Universitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Derya","lastName":"Yilmaz","id":"37586936900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3605-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3606-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5130363","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5130363","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autonomic nervous system","Heart rate variability","Electroencephalography","Electrocardiography","Electromyography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","electrocardiography","music","neurophysiology","pneumodynamics","psychology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Turkish music samples","autonomic nervous system","listening","subject emotional state","ANS","heart rate variability","HRV signals","noninvasive indicator","electrocardiogram","ECG","respiration records","power spectral densities","sympathetic activities","parasympathetic activities"]}],"abstract":"In this study, 27 young and healthy subjects was listening to the classical and Turkish music samples which are believed to changeable the subject's emotional state.

Although hierarchical modulation is an essential part of the DVB-H standard, it did receive little attention up to now. Compared to a standard modulation scheme, using hierarchical modulation can show a significant gain either in terms of bit-rate or required transmission power. Since with hierarchical modulation the channel capacity is spread over two independent multiplexes, a typical single layer video codec like H.264/AVC cannot fully utilize the given advantages. The combination with Scalable Video Coding (SVC) allows for both introducing new features in a backward compatible way and optimally utilizing the total channel capacity. Three exemplary applications for Mobile TV show, that the combination of the hierarchical modulation and SVC can show a significant benefit compared to current systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBMSB.2009.5133772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5133717","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075163/5133717/05133772.pdf","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile TV with SVC and hierarchical modulation for DVB-H broadcast services","doi":"10.1109/ISBMSB.2009.5133772","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5133772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Mobile TV with SVC and hierarchical modulation for DVB-H broadcast services","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5133772/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10736002","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5133772/","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile TV with SVC and hierarchical modulation for DVB-H broadcast services","confLoc":"Bilbao, Spain","sourcePdf":"50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083309S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075163","isNumber":"5133717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075163","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5133717","articleId":"5133772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5133788,"authors":[{"name":"Tero Jokela","affiliation":["Turku Centre of Computer Sciences, Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Tero","lastName":"Jokela","id":"37294321200"},{"name":"Jarkko Paavola","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarkko","lastName":"Paavola","id":"37269072600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2590-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2591-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"}],"articleNumber":"5133788","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":242},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Signal analysis","Physical layer","Digital video broadcasting","OFDM","Parity check codes","Multimedia communication","Channel coding","Concatenated codes","Interleaved codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","digital video broadcasting","error correction codes","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical layer signaling transmission","digital video broadcasting","terrestrial video broadcasting standard","DVB-T2","low density parity check codes","Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes","error control codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DTV","Performance evaluation","Channel coding"]}],"abstract":"Second generation terrestrial video broadcasting standard DVB-T2 is intended for delivery of HDTV services to users in the terrestrial broadcasting networks.

Therefore, transmitter identification (TxID) has been considered as an important feature in the ATSC standard for distributed transmission as it enables the broadcast authorities and operators to identify the source of interference or any illegal transmitter operating in a particular region. However, identification of the TxID sequence is a challenging issue due to the complexity offered by the conventional detection algorithm which is based on exhaustive search method or matched filter detection. In this paper, we propose to use a three-stage identification scheme which offers the same performance as the optimal matched filter but with significantly reduced implementation complexity. Design of this three-stage identifier is presented and corresponding complexity in terms of the computation and hardware implementation is also analyzed. The performance of the proposed three-stage approach are investigated and verified through the simulations in different channel scenarios. It is found from the simulation results that proposed identifier can provide reliable identification of DTV transmitters in large broadcast scenarios with significantly reduced hardware and computational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5133789/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5133789/","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10736013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel three-stage ATSC TxID identifier for robust data broadcasting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel three-stage ATSC TxID identifier for robust data broadcasting","confLoc":"Bilbao, Spain","sourcePdf":"67.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040212S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075163","isNumber":"5133717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075163","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5133717","articleId":"5133789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5133809,"authors":[{"name":"Maurizio Murroni","affiliation":["DIEE-University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Murroni","id":"37323987300"},{"name":"Vlad Popescu","affiliation":["Transilvania University of Brasov, Brasov, Romania"],"firstName":"Vlad","lastName":"Popescu","id":"37398310200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2590-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2591-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"}],"articleNumber":"5133809","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["TV","Wavelet packets","Wavelet analysis","White spaces","Dynamic programming","Wireless networks","IIR filters","Switches","Frequency","Intelligent networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subscriber loops","television networks","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing","dynamic spectrum access networks","UHF TV band using wavelets","wireless networks","wavelet packet decomposition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UHF TV band","wavelet packets subband analysis","Dynamic spectrum access networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5133809","doi":"10.1109/ISBMSB.2009.5133809","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","abstract":"Due to the transition to DTV, in early 2009 in the USA, the 700-MHz UHF band (channels 52 to 69) will be cleared of programming and set aside for bidding by wireless networks.

The new standard utilizes powerful LDPC codes and QAM constellation sizes up to 4096QAM. Additionally, it is based on OFDM instead of single-carrier modulation, which gives additional flexibility and robustness in typical cable channels.

The signal space diversity (SSD) has the advantage to increase the diversity order without the expansion of extra bandwidth and power by means of rotating the modulated symbols and interleaving the in-phase and quadrature components separately.

For demonstration, the overall transmitter is simulated in a 65 nm CMOS process with HSUPA and WLAN signals. The simulation results show an efficiency improvement from 17.7% to 40.7% for HSUPA at 25.3 dBm output power and from 11.3% to 35.5% for WLAN 802.11g at 22.8 dBm while still meeting system linearity

This paper is a review of a new distributed power amplifier (DPA) architecture using programmable frequency dispersion. This frequency domain dispersion is designed to achieve electronic harmonic filtering within the intended frequency band. Tunable reactive components are not practical in a high power transmitter network. Instead vector signal combining is used to provide very narrow band destructive harmonic cancellation while the vector signal processing for the fundamental is constructive. This is a novel technology that enables an all band software defined transmitter suitable for portable battery power communications equipment.","doi":"10.1109/RFIC.2009.5135531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIC.2009.5135531","startPage":"241","endPage":"244","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076160/5135437/05135531.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5135437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Power Amplifier with electronic harmonic filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Power Amplifier with electronic harmonic filtering","conferenceDate":"7-9 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5135531/","accessionNumber":"10748474","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5135531/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Power Amplifier with electronic harmonic filtering","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1295.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053499S","chronDate":"7-9 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076160","isNumber":"5135437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076160","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5135437","articleId":"5135531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5135532,"authors":[{"name":"Gary Zhang","affiliation":["Skyworks Solutions, Inc., Newbury Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gary","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37578450600"},{"name":"Shiaw Chang","affiliation":["Skyworks Solutions, Inc., Newbury Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shiaw","lastName":"Chang","id":"37579156000"},{"name":"Sunny Chen","affiliation":["Skyworks Solutions, Inc., Newbury Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sunny","lastName":"Chen","id":"37576981900"},{"name":"Jing Sun","affiliation":["Skyworks Solutions, Inc., Newbury Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Sun","id":"37579390900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3377-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3378-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1529-2517"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0995"}],"articleNumber":"5135532","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":46,"totalDownloads":1050},"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfic","packageName":"RFIC"},{"title":"IEEE RFID Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfid","packageName":"RFID"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Impedance","Linearity","High power amplifiers","3G mobile communication","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Circuits","Telephone sets","Multiaccess communication","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","code division multiple access","differential amplifiers","mobile handsets","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced linear power amplifier","3G handset power amplifier","WCDMA modulation","balanced amplifier","CELL band","UMTS band","LIFA feature","switched load insensitive power amplifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power amplifier","PAE","Linearity","HBT"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new balanced architecture to improve the power added efficiency (PAE) of a 3G handset power amplifier without trading-off its stringent linearity requirement.

The frequency synthesizer exhibits a phase noise better than -96 dBc/Hz at 100-kHz offset frequency for all the supported channels. The measured settling time is around 500 muS and the reference spurs are lower than -52 dBc.

In this work, a large-signal measurement setup is adapted to perform RF stress measurements on a 45 nm n-channel metal-oxide semiconductor transistor. The setup measures impedances and RF stress voltages under large-signal conditions at the measurement reference planes. This allows an accurate definition of applied stress conditions. A method to determine the lifetime of a device under RF stress is presented. The technique relates applied stress voltage to degradation of device characteristics. Channel hot-electron stress is applied to a device and degradation is measured over time. The device lifetime is determined by observing degradation of the saturation drain current. The results demonstrate the margin of improvement offered when a device is subjected to RF stress as compared to DC stress.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5135554/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10748497","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5135554/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"RF reliability of short channel NMOS devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF reliability of short channel NMOS devices","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05401S","chronDate":"7-9 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076160","isNumber":"5135437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076160","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5135437","articleId":"5135554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":5135559,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Afsahi","affiliation":["Center of Wireless Communications, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA","Broadcom Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Afsahi","id":"38494569200"},{"name":"Arya Behzad","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Arya","lastName":"Behzad","id":"37272052200"},{"name":"Vikram Magoon","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vikram","lastName":"Magoon","id":"37404050600"},{"name":"Lawrence E.

The GaN MMICs are based on a 0.2um AlGaN/GaN low noise T-gate HEMT technology with an fT \u223c 75 GHz. To increase the MMIC power capability of this low noise GaN technology, a cascode DA design approach was employed which can operate at twice the recommended Vds voltage. The resulting amplifiers achieve 1\u20134 Watts of saturated CW power from 100MHz to over 20GHz at an operating voltage of 30V. Typical OIP3 \u226b 40 dBm and NF of 3 dB were also achieved. Compared to equivalent designs in a similar 0.15um GaAs PHEMT low noise technology fabricated in the same foundry, these multi-decade GaN HEMT MMIC DAs obtain 6 dB higher output power and 5.8\u20136.6dB higher OIP3 while achieving comparable gain, noise figure, and bandwidth. These are believed to be the first multi-decade GaN power distributed amplifiers that have been demonstrated and can enable future ultra-wideband frequency agile and software defined radio systems that require baseband to microwave frequency operation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","HEMTs","Power amplifiers","Baseband","MMICs","Bandwidth","Voltage","Noise figure","Aluminum gallium nitride","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","distributed amplifiers","field effect MMIC","gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","MMIC power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multidecade HEMT","cascode-distributed power amplifier","high electron mobility transistors","low noise T-gate HEMT technology","MMIC power capability","ultrawideband frequency","software defined radio system","microwave frequency operation","size 0.2 mum","power 1 W to 4 W","voltage 30 V","size 0.15 mum","frequency 75 GHz","frequency 100 MHz to 20 GHz","AlGaN-GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed Amplifier","GaN HEMT","Low Noise Amplifier (LNA)","Power Amplifier (PA)","Cascode","GaAs PHEMT"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RFIC.2009.5135560","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076160/5135437/05135560.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5135437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIC.2009.5135560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-decade GaN HEMT Cascode-distributed power amplifier with baseband performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5135560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-decade GaN HEMT Cascode-distributed power amplifier with baseband performance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5135560/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5135560/","accessionNumber":"10748503","conferenceDate":"7-9 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-decade GaN HEMT Cascode-distributed power amplifier with baseband performance","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052715S","chronDate":"7-9 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076160","isNumber":"5135437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076160","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5135437","articleId":"5135560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5135561,"authors":[{"name":"Ofir Degani","affiliation":["Mobility Wireless Group, Intel Corporation, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Ofir","lastName":"Degani","id":"37373589200"},{"name":"Fabian Cossoy","affiliation":["Mobility Wireless Group, Intel Corporation, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Fabian","lastName":"Cossoy","id":"37398747200"},{"name":"Shay Shahaf","affiliation":["Mobility Wireless Group, Intel Corporation, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Shay","lastName":"Shahaf","id":"37409849800"},{"name":"Debopriyo Chowdhury","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Debopriyo","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"37391642000"},{"name":"Christopher D.

feedback single to differential low noise amplifier (S-to-D LNA) with single-ended multiple tuner outputs (MTOs) is implemented for a digital TV (DTV) tuner using a 0.18-m CMOS process. In order to achieve wideband output balancing with high gain, low noise figure (NF) and high linearity, the S-to-D LNA exploiting the resistive feedback with enhanced loop gain is proposed. The proposed S-to-D LNA also has single-ended MTOs which are made by combining the differential output of the S-to-D LNA without second-order distortion for supporting multiple tuner and multiple stream applications. This leads the excellent IIP2 at both differential output and single-ended MTOs of the proposed S-to-D LNA. A voltage gain of 19.5 dB, an average NF of 2.4 dB, an IIP3 of -2 dBm and an IIP2 of 26 dBm are obtained at differential output.

By further considering a practical delay in spectrum sensing, an efficient algorithm is proposed to maximize the average sum rate of the CR links over a finite time horizon under the constraints on the CR-to-PR interference and the average transmit power for each CR link. In the proposed algorithm, the PR occupancy of each channel is modeled as a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). Based on such a model, a novel power and rate control strategy based on dynamic programming (DP) is derived, which is a function of the delayed spectrum sensing output, the instantaneous channel gains for the CR links, and the remaining power budgets for the CR transmitters. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm leads to a significant performance improvement over three heuristic algorithms discussed in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5136187/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2009","volume":"58","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"10966671","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5136187/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Power and Rate Control for Delay-Constrained Cognitive Radios Via Dynamic Programming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power and Rate Control for Delay-Constrained Cognitive Radios Via Dynamic Programming","sourcePdf":"tvt-gao-2026282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097676S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5136187","onlineDate":"26 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5136189,"authors":[{"name":"Saurabh Prasad","affiliation":["Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Prasad","id":"37394773400"},{"name":"Lori Mann Bruce","affiliation":["Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Lori Mann","lastName":"Bruce","id":"37269412200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"5136189","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Hyperspectral sensors","Hyperspectral imaging","Linear discriminant analysis","Kernel","Target recognition","Principal component analysis","Reflectivity","Training data","Pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","image recognition","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic target recognition","hyperspectral-based ATR systems","high-dimensional hyperspectral reflectance signatures","principal component analysis","Fisher's linear discriminant analysis","general classification framework","divide-and-conquer approach","multiclassifier and decision-fusion framework","kernel discriminant analysis-based projection","conventional dimensionality-reduction techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decision fusion","kernel methods","multiclassifiers","pattern classification","target recognition"]}],"abstract":"Hyperspectral-based automatic target recognition (ATR) and classification systems often project the high-dimensional hyperspectral reflectance signatures onto a lower dimensional subspace using techniques such as principal component analysis, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and stepwise LDA. In a general classification framework, these projections are suboptimal and, in the absence of sufficient training data, are likely to be ill conditioned. In recent work, the authors proposed a divide-and-conquer approach that partitions the hyperspectral space into contiguous subspaces followed by a multiclassifier and decision-fusion (MCDF) framework. Although this technique alleviated the small-sample-size problem and provided a good recognition performance in light and moderate pixel mixing, the performance significantly decreased under severe mixing conditions, as it does with conventional ATR techniques. In this letter, the authors propose a kernel discriminant analysis-based projection in each subspace of the partition, followed by the MCDF framework to ensure robust recognition even in severe pixel-mixing conditions. The performance of the proposed system (as measured by overall recognition accuracies) is greatly superior to conventional dimensionality-reduction techniques as well as the more recently proposed LDA-based MCDF technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Fusion in Kernel-Induced Spaces for Robust Subpixel Hyperspectral ATR","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2009.2022852","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/5153590/05136189.pdf","startPage":"572","endPage":"576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2009.2022852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5153590","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5136189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5136189/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Information Fusion in Kernel-Induced Spaces for Robust Subpixel Hyperspectral ATR","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5136189/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10735863","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Fusion in Kernel-Induced Spaces for Robust Subpixel Hyperspectral ATR","sourcePdf":"lgrs-prasad-2022852.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145521S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"5153590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5153590","articleId":"5136189","onlineDate":"26 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5136190,"authors":[{"name":"Peter E.

The above requires the need of advanced numerical techniques for simulation studies by PSCAD on a sample distribution system for determining a global optimum HTS FCL, by considering individual parameters and accounting for the constraints, which is the main motivation for initiating this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2009.2020692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2009.2020692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/5175628/05136196.pdf","startPage":"3675","endPage":"3682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5175628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5136196/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization for HTS Fault-Current Limiters Based on Normalized Simulated Annealing","volume":"19","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10794818","htmlLink":"/document/5136196/","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Optimization for HTS Fault-Current Limiters Based on Normalized Simulated Annealing","sourcePdf":"tasc-heydari-2020692.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080885S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"5175628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5175628","articleId":"5136196","onlineDate":"26 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5136262,"authors":[{"name":"Flavius Opritoiu","affiliation":["Polytechnic University of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Flavius","lastName":"Opritoiu","id":"37320363900"},{"name":"Mircea Vladutiu","affiliation":["Polytechnic University of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Mircea","lastName":"Vladutiu","id":"37282071500"},{"name":"Lucian Prodan","affiliation":["Polytechnic University of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Lucian","lastName":"Prodan","id":"37282071900"},{"name":"Mihai Udrescu","affiliation":["Polytechnic University of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Udrescu","id":"37282072100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4477-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4478-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5136262","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic testing","Cryptography","Circuit testing","Built-in self-test","Circuit faults","Hardware","Galois fields","Fault detection","Information security","Integrated circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","cryptography","fault diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced encryption standard","built-in self test applicability","nonlinear operations","concurrent testing solution","pseudorandom testing principle","fault detection"]}],"abstract":"The paper assesses in terms of fault coverage the testing effectiveness of built-in self test for the non-linear operations of the advanced encryption standard (AES).

The pseudorandom testing principle described in this article can be easily integrated into an AES design regardless of the particular implementation of the non-linear modules, and requires access only to the unit's inputs and outputs.

In this study, block-based motion compensation is added to the normal 3D lifting method. Domain of motion compensation is first selected as free, and then reverse-symmetric. It is observed that reverse-symmetric motion compensation improves the performance of the 3D lifting coding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3D lifting based motion compensation augmented video coder","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2009.5136322","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072204/5136316/05136322.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2009.5136322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5136316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5136322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5136322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A 3D lifting based motion compensation augmented video coder","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5136322/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10732666","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3D lifting based motion compensation augmented video coder","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042008S","chronDate":"9-11 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072204","isNumber":"5136316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072204","xplore-issue":"5136316","articleId":"5136322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5136355,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Soleimani Nasab","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, K.N.

We propose an efficient cooperative scheduling and data transmission scheme, requiring limited information exchange between the base stations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072204/5136316/05136397.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"324","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2009.5136397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2009.5136397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5136316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5136397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Base station cooperation in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Frequency conversion","Interference","Data communication","MIMO","Wireless communication","WiMAX"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","interference suppression","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["base station cooperation","orthogonal frequency division multiple access systems","OFDMA systems","next generation wireless communication systems","intercell interference reduction","cooperative data transmission","multicellular multiple-input multiple-output systems","cooperative scheduling","MIMO systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5136397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Base station cooperation in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5136397/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10732679","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Base station cooperation in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063131S","chronDate":"9-11 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072204","isNumber":"5136316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072204","xplore-issue":"5136316","articleId":"5136397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5136400,"authors":[{"name":"K.

If current transformer specifications are not selected properly, saturation may occur and affect relay response or even fail to trip. Hence, the performance of the protection devices such as differential and impedance relays is mainly based on the operating condition of the current transformers. An accurate knowledge of current signal is essential for protection devices. In this paper, a different approach is represented for current transformer saturation problem. The proposed technique is based on the discrete wavelet transform. The energy levels of the detail coefficients after the transformation present distinctive features during current transformer saturation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072204/5136316/05136429.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"451","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2009.5136429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2009.5136429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5136316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5136429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete wavelet transform based approach for current transformer saturation problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Current transformers","Protection","Protective relaying","Impedance","Energy states"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current transformers","discrete wavelet transforms","power transformer protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transform","current transformer saturation problem","protection devices","differential relays","impedance relays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5136429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Discrete wavelet transform based approach for current transformer saturation problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5136429/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10746183","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete wavelet transform based approach for current transformer saturation problem","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056553S","chronDate":"9-11 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072204","isNumber":"5136316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072204","xplore-issue":"5136316","articleId":"5136429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5136437,"authors":[{"name":"Yakup Kilic","affiliation":["Telsiz Iletisim Laboratuvari, Elektrik ve Elektronik Muhendisligi Bolumu, Bogazici Universitesi, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Yakup","lastName":"Kilic","id":"37086623282"},{"name":"Mutlu Koca","affiliation":["Telsiz Iletisim Laboratuvari, Elektrik ve Elektronik Muhendisligi Bolumu, Bogazici Universitesi, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mutlu","lastName":"Koca","id":"37296264100"},{"name":"Emin Anarim","affiliation":["Telsiz Iletisim Laboratuvari, Elektrik ve Elektronik Muhendisligi Bolumu, Bogazici Universitesi, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Emin","lastName":"Anarim","id":"37296566900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4435-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4436-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5136437","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna theory","Communication systems","Performance analysis","Analytical models","Block codes","Polarization","Interference","System performance","Samarium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","diversity reception","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time-polarization diversity","multiple-input multiple-output communication systems","space-time block coding","MIMO communication systems","dual-polarized antennas","virtual antennas","cross-polar interference","theoretical analysis"]}],"abstract":"We investigate the use of space-time block coding (STBC) in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems which employ more than one dual-polarized antennas.

The main features of this architecture are: 1) No external memory is required; 2) Computation of each pixel is carried out in three clock cycles and; 3) The number of Euler iterations required for the computation of the output values is determined by the number of implemented processor units (PUs). The architecture is based on a single pipelined cell which is employed to emulate a CNN with larger number of neurons. This cell consists of many processing units connected in cascade and working simultaneously. The image data is to be transmitted to the emulator (FPGA) in a progressive manner as in the case of VGA, DVI, progressive cameras or digital interfaced CMOS cameras. The video image pixels are processed and outputted simultaneously with the incoming pixel values. The proposed architecture is realized on a Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA in Celoxica RC203 board and used in an edge detection application. The implemented system is tested to process a 640 times 480 pixel 60 fps monochrome VGA video input using 18 bit 3 times 3 CNN templates and the output video is observed on a VGA monitor.","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2009.5136446","startPage":"516","endPage":"519","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072204/5136316/05136446.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2009.5136446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5136316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new Cellular Neural Network emulator architecture processing video real-time","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular neural networks","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Digital cameras","CMOS image sensors","Pixel","Signal processing","Clocks","Neurons","Page description languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","field programmable gate arrays","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural network emulator architecture","real-time video signal processing","FPGA","Euler iteration","processor unit","digital interfaced CMOS camera","video image pixel","edge detection application","field programmable gate arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5136446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new Cellular Neural Network emulator architecture processing video real-time","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5136446/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10746192","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new Cellular Neural Network emulator architecture processing video real-time","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044997S","chronDate":"9-11 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072204","isNumber":"5136316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072204","xplore-issue":"5136316","articleId":"5136446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5136449,"authors":[{"name":"Ertugrul Basar","affiliation":["Elektrik-Elektronik Fakultesi, Elektronik ve Haberleme Muhendislii Bolumu, Istanbul Teknik Universitesi, Turkiye"],"firstName":"Ertugrul","lastName":"Basar","id":"38666344600"},{"name":"Umit Aygolu","affiliation":["Elektrik-Elektronik Fakultesi, Elektronik ve Haberleme Muhendislii Bolumu, Istanbul Teknik Universitesi, Turkiye"],"firstName":"Umit","lastName":"Aygolu","id":"37267743300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4435-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4436-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5136449","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"abstract":"In this paper, three new multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel capacity achieving, full and partial diversity, space-time block codes with reduced decoder complexities are proposed for MIMO systems having two, three and four transmit antennas.

The resulting complex wavelet based feature vectors are as discriminating as the Gabor wavelets derived features and at the same time are of lower dimension when compared with that of Gabor wavelets. In all experiments, complex wavelets equaled or surpassed the performance of Gabor wavelets in recognition rate when equal number of orientations and scales are used. Obtained results indicate that complex wavelets can provide a successful alternative to Gabor wavelets for face recognition.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072204/5136316/05136451.pdf","startPage":"536","endPage":"539","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2009.5136451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2009.5136451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5136316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5136451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-tree and single-tree complex wavelet transform based face recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Face recognition","Sun","Principal component analysis","Wavelet analysis","Spatial databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","Gabor filters","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","dual tree complex wavelet transform","single tree wavelet complex wavelet transform","feature vectors","Gabor wavelets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5136451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dual-tree and single-tree complex wavelet transform based face recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5136451/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10746195","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-tree and single-tree complex wavelet transform based face recognition","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067341S","chronDate":"9-11 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072204","isNumber":"5136316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072204","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5136316","articleId":"5136451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5136455,"authors":[{"name":"Selami Parmaksizoglu","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik Muhendislii Bolumu, Erciyes Universitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Selami","lastName":"Parmaksizoglu","id":"37294561500"},{"name":"Mustafa Alci","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik Muhendislii Bolumu, Erciyes Universitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Alci","id":"37267766600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4435-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4436-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5136455","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Cellular neural networks","Cloning","Genetic algorithms","Image edge detection","Circuit testing","Digital images","Circuit simulation","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","edge detection","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","cellular neural network circuit","genetic algorithm","cloning template","digital image","CNN circuit structure"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5136455","abstract":"In this paper determination of cloning templates of cellular neural networks (CNN) which detects edges on digital images by genetic algorithm (GA) is presented.

This problem, which is nonlinear due to its nature, also has a discrete structure. In this paper, a fast algorithm based on linear programming is proposed. The algorithm is composed of two phases. In the first one, the original integer programming problem is first linearized and then after relaxing the integer constraints a solution is obtained by the aid of the Simplex Algorithm. In the second phase, by exploiting the sub-carrier allocation obtained in first phase, bits are allocated to each user independently using the Greedy Algorithm. The simulation results have demonstrated that, the proposed algorithm can achieve a performance very close to that of the integer programming techniques while being significantly faster.","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2009.5136458","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072204/5136316/05136458.pdf","startPage":"564","endPage":"567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2009.5136458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5136316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation for OFDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5136458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5136458/","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation for OFDMA systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10746202","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5136458/","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation for OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072284S","chronDate":"9-11 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072204","isNumber":"5136316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072204","xplore-issue":"5136316","articleId":"5136458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5136486,"authors":[{"name":"Caglar Ates","affiliation":["Isaret ve Goruntu Isleme Laboratuvari (KULIS), Elektronik ve Haberleme Muhendislii Bolumu, Kocaeli Universitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Caglar","lastName":"Ates","id":"37085935642"},{"name":"Oguzhan Urhan","affiliation":["Isaret ve Goruntu Isleme Laboratuvari (KULIS), Elektronik ve Haberleme Muhendislii Bolumu, Kocaeli Universitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Oguzhan","lastName":"Urhan","id":"37295913000"},{"name":"Sarp Erturk","affiliation":["Isaret ve Goruntu Isleme Laboratuvari (KULIS), Elektronik ve Haberleme Muhendislii Bolumu, Kocaeli Universitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sarp","lastName":"Erturk","id":"37267855900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4435-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4436-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5136486","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video compression","Video coding","IP networks","Mobile handsets","Information filtering","Information filters","Performance loss","Discrete cosine transforms","Matching pursuit algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image sampling","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple description video coding","optimal filtering strategy","polyphase downsampling","video compression approach","still image"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5136486","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2009.5136486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2009.5136486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5136316","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072204/5136316/05136486.pdf","startPage":"676","endPage":"679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal filtering for polyphase downsampling based multiple description coded video","abstract":"Multiple description coding (MDC) is an important alternative compression approach for networks which have tendency to packet losses.

Various features of the modulated signal are investigated to be able to identify them in practical wireless channels.","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2009.5136502","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072204/5136316/05136502.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2009.5136502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5136316","startPage":"740","endPage":"744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind investigation of M-FSK modulations and identification of these modulations from M-PSK and M-QAM modulations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5136502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind investigation of M-FSK modulations and identification of these modulations from M-PSK and M-QAM modulations","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5136502/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10746238","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5136502/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind investigation of M-FSK modulations and identification of these modulations from M-PSK and M-QAM modulations","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045193S","chronDate":"9-11 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072204","isNumber":"5136316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072204","xplore-issue":"5136316","articleId":"5136502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5136568,"authors":[{"name":"Rainfield Y.

The early detection of unusual anomaly in the network is a key to fast recover and avoidance of future serious problem to provide a stable network transmission. In this paper we present a statistical approach to analysis the distribution of network traffic to identify the normal network traffic behavior. We adapt the EM algorithm to estimate the distribution parameter of Gaussian mixture distribution model. If only there is a statistical signature of unusual fluctuation or change in the network traffic an alarm will be triggered. We adapt the time series analysis of the statistical analysis result. Up bound and low bound will be defined through the analysis. The exceeding of the bound will be the signal of traffic anomaly. Another time series analysis approach also can reflect the fluctuation of network with the crossover of two indicator lines called K line and D line. These two indicator lines are some think like the mean value of the historical data in a time slice with one more sensitive to the change of the new coming data and another not. The approach three-MACD indicator approach is like the K D approach but more blunt to the unusual fluctuation of network traffic which can submit an alarm more correctly.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Anomaly Detection Based on Statistical Approach and Time Series Analysis","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops","doi":"10.1109/WAINA.2009.58","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136571/5136572/05136649.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WAINA.2009.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5136572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5136649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5136649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Network Anomaly Detection Based on Statistical Approach and Time Series Analysis","conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5136649/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10733795","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Anomaly Detection Based on Statistical Approach and Time Series Analysis","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"3639a205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.160122S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136571","isNumber":"5136572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136571","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5136572","articleId":"5136649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5136675,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Smith","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Smith","id":"37277412300"},{"name":"Christian Schridde","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schridde","id":"37542380500"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Agel","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Agel","id":"37567519500"},{"name":"Bernd Freisleben","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Freisleben","id":"37270933900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3999-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3639-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5136675","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":283},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5136675","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Identity-based encryption","Mobile handsets","Telephony","Public key","GSM","3G mobile communication","Protocols","Base stations","Cryptography","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","public key cryptography","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identity-based cryptography","mobile phone call security","mobile telephony","GSM network","UMTS network","public key management","telephone numbers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Security","Identity Based Cryptography","GSM","UMTS","Mobile Phones"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WAINA.2009.167","endPage":"370","startPage":"365","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136571/5136572/05136675.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WAINA.2009.167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5136572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identity-Based Cryptography for Securing Mobile Phone Calls","abstract":"In this paper, an identity-based key agreement system for mobile telephony in GSM and UMTS networks is presented.

Although SWCNNs have better performance than CNNs, one of the weaknesses of the SWCNN is fault tolerance. Previously, we proposed multiple SWCNN layers to improve the fault tolerance of the SWCNN.

Meanwhile, recent advances in ambient energy harvesting technology have made it a viable alternative source of energy for powering WSNs. WSNs powered by ambient energy harvesting (WSN-HEAP) are potentially moreuseful and economical in the long term than traditionalbattery-powered WSNs as they can operate for very long periods of time without the need for human involvement, thus paving the way towards alleviating energy constraints that continue to challenge WSNs. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of transmit power control on the usefulness of a multi-sink WSN-HEAP, deployed in uniform string topology for railway track monitoring. Based on current achievable energy harvesting rates from track deflections, and commercially available sensor mote parameters, our analysis reveals that availability can be maximised while maintaining good data delivery ratio and throughput-fairness by appropriate setting of the transmit power over a wide range of deployment density, Signal-to-Noise Ratio requirements and energy harvesting characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/WAINA.2009.113","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136571/5136572/05136748.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5136572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WAINA.2009.113","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops","startPage":"804","endPage":"809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Power Control in Wireless Sensor Networks Powered by Ambient Energy Harvesting (WSN-HEAP) for Railroad Health Monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5136748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Power Control in Wireless Sensor Networks Powered by Ambient Energy Harvesting (WSN-HEAP) for Railroad Health Monitoring","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5136748/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5136748/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10733857","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Power Control in Wireless Sensor Networks Powered by Ambient Energy Harvesting (WSN-HEAP) for Railroad Health Monitoring","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"3639a804.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067057S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136571","isNumber":"5136572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136571","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5136572","articleId":"5136748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5136803,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Erik H\u00e5keg\u00e5rd","affiliation":["SINTEF, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Jan Erik","lastName":"H\u00e5keg\u00e5rd","id":"37568537800"},{"name":"Knut Grythe","affiliation":["SINTEF, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Knut","lastName":"Grythe","id":"37568547000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3999-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3639-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5136803","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Underwater communication","MIMO","Radio communication","OFDM","Underwater acoustics","Communication channels","WiMAX","Estimation error","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","error statistics","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","underwater acoustic communication","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation errors","OFDM-MIMO-based underwater communications","radio communication systems","multicarrier communication","multiple antennas","underwater acoustic communication channel","WiMax","IEEE802.16","BER performance","single antenna systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic communication","OFDM","MIMO"]}],"abstract":"State-of-the-art radio communication systems are in a large extent based on multi-carrier communication (OFDM) and multiple antennas (MIMO).

The sensor nodes located in the same hierarchical level are multiplexed by means of different orthogonal codes. Both single-code and multi-code allocation schemes are analyzed.

Several factors such as quadratic cost functions with valve point loading, transmission loss, generator ramp rate limits and prohibited operating zone are considered in the computation models. This new approach provides a new mechanism to restrain the predominating of super (global best) particles in early stage and can effectively avoid the premature convergence problem and speed up the convergence property. The proposed method has been applied to a 3 & 10 generator power system whose cost functions are non-convex in nature. Results obtained by this method have been compared with those obtained from particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. The experimental results show that the proposed modified PSO method is indeed capable of obtaining solution in less time and in fewer numbers of iterations.","doi":"10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5136970","startPage":"78","endPage":"81","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5136970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5136907","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076159/5136907/05136970.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified Particle Swarm Optimization for solving the non-convex economic dispatch","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5136970/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A modified Particle Swarm Optimization for solving the non-convex economic dispatch","isConference":true,"volume":"01","htmlLink":"/document/5136970/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10746619","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"6-9 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified Particle Swarm Optimization for solving the non-convex economic dispatch","confLoc":"Chonburi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"1-040078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104838S","chronDate":"6-9 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076159","isNumber":"5136907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076159","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5136907","articleId":"5136970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5136976,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The main reason is increase in the number of output voltage levels and its apparent frequency. Balancing of flying capacitors voltages is an important constraint to proper performance of FCM converters. So, observation of these flying capacitors voltages for using in active control is valuable where using voltage sensors results in increasing cost and size of the converter. This paper presents a new strategy to estimate flying capacitors voltages of FCM converters. The proposed strategy is based on discrete time model of converter. So, advantage of the proposed strategy is its simplicity which is effective for real time implementation. The circuit is simulated using PSCAD/EMTDC software and simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation strategy to observe the flying capacitors voltages.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076159/5136907/05136976.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"113","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5136907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5136976","doi":"10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5136976","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5136976","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Circuit simulation","Medium voltage","Frequency","Size control","Voltage control","Capacitive sensors","Costs","PSCAD","EMTDC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","power convertors","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flying capacitors voltage estimation","flying capacitor multicell converters","active control","voltage sensors","discrete time model","PSCAD/EMTDC software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["flying capacitor multicell converter","flying capacitor","estimation","phase shifted pulse width modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5136976/","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of flying capacitors voltages in multicell converters","accessionNumber":"10746625","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5136976/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 May 2009","volume":"01","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of flying capacitors voltages in multicell converters","confLoc":"Chonburi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"1-060110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040048S","chronDate":"6-9 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076159","isNumber":"5136907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076159","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5136907","articleId":"5136976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5136987,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Traditionally, scale factors, membership functions and control rules of FL controller are obtained by trial and error method or experiences of designers. Moreover, the isolated wind-natural gas hybrid power system is a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system. For that reason, it is not straightforward to design both load frequency controllers simultaneously. To overcome this problem, PSO is applied to concurrently tune scale factors, membership functions and control rules of FL controller to minimize frequency deviations of the system against load disturbances. Simulation results explicitly show that the performance of the optimum FL controller is superior to the conventional PID controller and the non-optimum FL controller in terms of the overshoot, settling time and robustness against various load changes and variations of wind inputs.","doi":"10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5136987","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076159/5136907/05136987.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"167","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5136987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5136907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal fuzzy logic controller design using particle swarm optimization for wind-natural gas power system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5136987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal fuzzy logic controller design using particle swarm optimization for wind-natural gas power system","isConference":true,"volume":"01","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10746636","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5136987/","conferenceDate":"6-9 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal fuzzy logic controller design using particle swarm optimization for wind-natural gas power system","confLoc":"Chonburi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"1-080164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040723S","chronDate":"6-9 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076159","isNumber":"5136907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076159","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5136907","articleId":"5136987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5136991,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The simulations which are compared to the measured values of the test sets provide satisfactory estimation of electrical loss with an acceptable error.","doi":"10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5137002","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076159/5136907/05137002.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"251","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5137002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5136907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Artificial Neural Networks for electrical losses estimation in three-phase transformer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Application of Artificial Neural Networks for electrical losses estimation in three-phase transformer","isConference":true,"volume":"01","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10746650","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5137002/","conferenceDate":"6-9 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Artificial Neural Networks for electrical losses estimation in three-phase transformer","confLoc":"Chonburi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"1-120248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041899S","chronDate":"6-9 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076159","isNumber":"5136907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076159","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5136907","articleId":"5137002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":5137013,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Moreover, the transistor of the active load current source operates like a common source amplifier. In order to improve phase margin, we utilize Feed-Forward (FF) compensation. Since we utilize cascode compensation at the second stage, the speed of the amplifier depends on only the first stage. This circuit is simulated with a 1.2 v single supply voltage in 0.13 mum process and Level49 (TSMC) parameters for 2 pf capacitor load. Finally, this structure is checked by a typical switched-capacitor integrator with a 100 MHz clock frequency. The results determined from simulation illustrate appropriateness of our solution in comparison with previous circuits.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Frequency","Transconductance","Operational amplifiers","Circuit simulation","Threshold voltage","Feedforward systems","Impedance","Transfer functions","Switched capacitor circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascade networks","integrating circuits","low-power electronics","operational amplifiers","switched capacitor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra high-speed low-voltage amplifier","switched-capacitor applications","folded-cascode structure","class AB amplifier","active load current source","transconductance","feed-forward compensation","Level49 (TSMC) parameter","switched-capacitor integrator","voltage 1.2 V","size 0.13 mum","capacitance 2 pF","frequency 100 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Folded-Cascode (FC) Structure","Feed-forward (FF) compensation","Switched-Capacitor (SC) application"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5137067","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076159/5136907/05137067.pdf","startPage":"552","endPage":"555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5136907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5137067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ultra high-speed and low-voltage amplifier for switched-capacitor applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5137067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An ultra high-speed and low-voltage amplifier for switched-capacitor applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137067/","isConference":true,"volume":"01","publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5137067/","accessionNumber":"10746715","conferenceDate":"6-9 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ultra high-speed and low-voltage amplifier for switched-capacitor applications","confLoc":"Chonburi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"1-270552.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064288S","chronDate":"6-9 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076159","isNumber":"5136907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076159","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5136907","articleId":"5137067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5137079,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The advantage of this beamformer is that it requires only attenuators or amplifiers to perform beam formation in wide frequency band as its weighting coefficients become real values. As a result tapped-delay lines, frequency filters or phase shifters are avoidable. This paper presents an extended work for the mentioned wideband spatial beamformer. The beamforming algorithm is modified in order to produce multi-beam patterns with one set of real-valued weights with the purpose of energy saving. The proposed concept is tested through simulation results to confirm beamforming capability.","doi":"10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5137161","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076159/5137082/05137161.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5137161","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","startPage":"774","endPage":"777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low profile multi-beam former operating in wide frequency band","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5137161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low profile multi-beam former operating in wide frequency band","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137161/","isConference":true,"volume":"02","htmlLink":"/document/5137161/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10746740","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"6-9 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low profile multi-beam former operating in wide frequency band","confLoc":"Chonburi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"2-370774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067213S","chronDate":"6-9 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076159","isNumber":"5137082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076159","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5137082","articleId":"5137161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5137176,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Due to the area constraint on mobile terminal, the number of antennas is limited by antenna layout. The problem of how to design such a system in order to achieve the best benefit is still a huge challenge. In this paper, the attempt to realize the optimal antenna positions on mobile terminal for 4times4 MIMO systems is presented. The analysis is focused on the all possible positions of arranging four antennas on rectangular area. The spatial fading correlation and mutual coupling effects are the main considerations used for examining the maximum MIMO capacity obtained by optimal antenna positions. The simulation results indicate that the best capacity performance can be obtained when four antennas are located at four corners.","doi":"10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5137177","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076159/5137082/05137177.pdf","startPage":"840","endPage":"843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5137177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal antenna positions on mobile terminal for 4\u00d74 MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5137177","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137177/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal antenna positions on mobile terminal for 4\u00d74 MIMO systems","volume":"02","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10732960","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5137177/","conferenceDate":"6-9 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal antenna positions on mobile terminal for 4\u00d74 MIMO systems","confLoc":"Chonburi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"2-410840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052733S","chronDate":"6-9 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076159","isNumber":"5137082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076159","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5137082","articleId":"5137177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5137178,"authors":[{"name":"Apinya Innok","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Suranaree University\uc2a0of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand"],"firstName":"Apinya","lastName":"Innok","id":"37570016800"},{"name":"Monthippa Uthansakul","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Suranaree University\uc2a0of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand"],"firstName":"Monthippa","lastName":"Uthansakul","id":"37279117800"},{"name":"Peerapong Uthansakul","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Suranaree University\uc2a0of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand"],"firstName":"Peerapong","lastName":"Uthansakul","id":"37279043200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3387-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3388-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5137178","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"abstract":"This paper aims to present the benefit of using a Butler matrix for MIMO systems employing angle domain processing instead of array domain processing.

The quantized signatures are relayed from the receiver to users via noiseless rate-limited feedback channels. Previously, we have proposed to organize entries of RVQ codebook into a tree structure (TS) to speed up a search for the optimal entry.

For robustness, we consider joint power allocation with imperfect channel state information (CSI), where the CSI error is assumed to be unknown but bounded by a constant. We point out that this problem can be expressed as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem with bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraints.

codes with low encoding complexity for high-rate applications","abstract":"This paper presents a method to construct irregular structured low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes based on choosing different identity matrices. The parity-check matrix of the proposed code can be easily generated with the flexible parameters such as code rate, block length or sparsity. The proposed code is well structured which can provide a low-complexity implementation. The encoder of the proposed code has linear encoding complexity making it suitable for hardware implementation. When iteratively decoded with the sum-product algorithm (SPA), the constructed irregular LDPC codes exhibit a very good performance especially for high rate codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137202/","conferenceDate":"6-9 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 May 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"02","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10746767","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5137202/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Construction of irregular structured LDPC codes with low encoding complexity for high-rate applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of irregular structured LDPC codes with low encoding complexity for high-rate applications","confLoc":"Chonburi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"2-460950.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047193S","chronDate":"6-9 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076159","isNumber":"5137082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076159","xplore-issue":"5137082","articleId":"5137202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5137203,"authors":[{"name":"Pornpawit Boonsrimuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mie University, Japan"],"firstName":"Pornpawit","lastName":"Boonsrimuang","id":"38232081900"},{"name":"Boonsiri Kriengkriwat","affiliation":["Telecommunication Engineering Department, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Boonsiri","lastName":"Kriengkriwat","id":"37086797177"},{"name":"Pisit Boonsrimuang","affiliation":["Telecommunication Engineering Department, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pisit","lastName":"Boonsrimuang","id":"37327400700"},{"name":"Tawil Paungma","affiliation":["Telecommunication Engineering Department, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Tawil","lastName":"Paungma","id":"37327400000"},{"name":"Hideo Kobayashi","affiliation":["Telecommunication Engineering Department, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"lastName":"Hideo Kobayashi","id":"37279510000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3387-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3388-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5137203","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Partial transmit sequences","Bit error rate","Telecommunication computing","Fast Fourier transforms","Wireless communication","Bandwidth","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","fast Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["D-PTS sub-blocking technique","nonuniform weighting factor","PAPR reduction","OFDM system","partial transmit sequence","inverse fast Fourier transform","computation complexity"]}],"abstract":"Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) method is a well - known method which can reduce the peak-to-average ratio (PAPR) for an OFDM signal. A major drawback of PTS method is its higher computation complexity due to the necessity of larger number of inverse fast Fourier transforms (IFFT). The PTS method with low computation complexity, called decomposition PTS (D-PTS) sub-blocking was proposed which employs the radix-r IFFT for the signals at the middle stages of an N-point radix-r IFFT and decimation in frequency (DIF) domain.

By the way, Fabry-Perot laser diodes and multi mode fibers are adopted in the access ring due to cost down and increase number of optical network units (ONUs).

Results show that the system performance is limited by SOA output power and indicate that the SOA can be used as a pre- or inline- amplifier where its optimal gain of approximately 20 dB can be utilized.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5137210","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076159/5137082/05137210.pdf","startPage":"983","endPage":"986","doi":"10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5137210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplified subcarrier multiplexed Passive Optical Network using a Semiconductor Optical Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Amplified subcarrier multiplexed Passive Optical Network using a Semiconductor Optical Amplifier","isConference":true,"volume":"02","conferenceDate":"6-9 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5137210/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10746771","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137210/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplified subcarrier multiplexed Passive Optical Network using a Semiconductor Optical Amplifier","confLoc":"Chonburi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"2-470983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043015S","chronDate":"6-9 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076159","isNumber":"5137082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076159","xplore-issue":"5137082","articleId":"5137210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5137230,"authors":[{"name":"Vorapoj Patanavijit","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Network Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Assumption University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Vorapoj","lastName":"Patanavijit","id":"37300535000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3387-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3388-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5137230","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5137230","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","Noise robustness","Stochastic resonance","AWGN","Iterative algorithms","Image reconstruction","Cost function","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","image reconstruction","image resolution","iterative methods","stochastic processes","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image video enhancement","Hampel stochastic estimation","super-resolution reconstruction","robust iterative stochastic regularization technique","AWGN noise","Poisson noise","Salt noise","Pepper noise","Speckle noise","Tikhonov regularization"]}],"abstract":"Many image video enhancements assume that the noise model of the imaging system is known in advance such as AWGN. However, the real noise model is not known in many practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel robust video enhancement algorithm using SRR (super-resolution reconstruction) based on the stochastic regularization technique by minimizing a cost function. First, the classical registration process is used to estimate the relationship between the reference frame and other neighboring frames. Later, the Hampel norm is used for measuring the difference between the projected estimate of the high quality image and each low high quality image and for removing outliers in the data. Moreover, Tikhonov regularization is incorporated in the proposed framework in order to remove artifacts from the final answer and to improve the rate of convergence. Finally, experimental results are presented to demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison to several previously published methods using standard sequences such as Foreman and Susie that are corrupted by several noise models such as AWGN, Poisson Noise, Salt & Pepper Noise and Speckle Noise.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5137230","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076159/5137082/05137230.pdf","startPage":"1072","endPage":"1075","doi":"10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5137230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video enhancement using a robust iterative SRR based on Hampel stochastic estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Video enhancement using a robust iterative SRR based on Hampel stochastic estimation","isConference":true,"volume":"02","conferenceDate":"6-9 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5137230/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10746780","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137230/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video enhancement using a robust iterative SRR based on Hampel stochastic estimation","confLoc":"Chonburi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"2-521072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05793S","chronDate":"6-9 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076159","isNumber":"5137082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076159","xplore-issue":"5137082","articleId":"5137230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5137235,"authors":[{"name":"Majid Kiamini","affiliation":["Engineering Department, University of zanjan, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Kiamini","id":"37570186200"},{"name":"Shahpour Alirezaee","affiliation":["Engineering Department, University of zanjan, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Shahpour","lastName":"Alirezaee","id":"37424416800"},{"name":"Bahram Perseh","affiliation":["Biophysics Department, Medical sciences, Zanjan University, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Bahram","lastName":"Perseh","id":"37570176600"},{"name":"Majid Ahmadi","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Ahmadi","id":"37276374600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3387-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3388-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5137235","dbTime":"36 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":392},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Wavelet transforms","Independent component analysis","Principal component analysis","Electrooculography","Signal processing","Filtering","Biomedical engineering","Engineering in medicine and biology","Biophysics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","brain","electroencephalography","eye","filtering theory","medical signal processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ocular artifacts elimination","EEG signals","wavelet transform","empirical mode decomposition","electroencephalogram","electrical activity","brain","eyeball movement","filtering techniques","frequency 0 Hz to 64 Hz"]}],"abstract":"Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a biological signal that represents the electrical activity of the brain. EEG signal may be highly distorted by the eye-blinks and movements of the eyeballs that are collectively known as ocular artifacts (OA). OA severely limit the utility of the recorded EEG and thus need to be removed for better clinical evaluation. The frequency range of EEG signal is 0 to 64 Hz and the OA occur within the range of 0 to 16 Hz. Therefore, simple filtering techniques cannot be used to eliminate OA from EEG. This paper present a method based on the wavelet transform to automatically identify the OA zones in contaminated EEG signal. Then, only removing it's to obtain the clean EEG by the recently developed empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed method in identification and removal of ocular artifacts from EEG signal comparison with other filtering approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elimination of Ocular Artifacts from EEG signals using the wavelet transform and empirical mode decomposition","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5137235","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076159/5137082/05137235.pdf","startPage":"1094","endPage":"1097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5137235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5137235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Elimination of Ocular Artifacts from EEG signals using the wavelet transform and empirical mode decomposition","conferenceDate":"6-9 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"02","htmlLink":"/document/5137235/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10746784","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elimination of Ocular Artifacts from EEG signals using the wavelet transform and empirical mode decomposition","confLoc":"Chonburi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"2-531094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049424S","chronDate":"6-9 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076159","isNumber":"5137082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076159","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5137082","articleId":"5137235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5137249,"authors":[{"name":"Peerapol Yuvapoositanon","affiliation":["Centre of Electronic Systems Design and Signal Processing, Department of Electronic Engineering, Mahanakom University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Peerapol","lastName":"Yuvapoositanon","id":"37281513500"},{"name":"Sutat Suwannajan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Mahanakom University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Sutat","lastName":"Suwannajan","id":"37567814800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3387-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3388-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5137249","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","Signal processing algorithms","Blind equalizers","Frequency","Time domain analysis","Adaptive equalizers","Frequency-selective fading channels","Signal design","Design engineering","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive equalisers","blind equalisers","block codes","code division multiple access","fading channels","multiuser channels","radio receivers","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MC-CDMA receiver","multicarrier code-division multiple access","blind adaptive equalisation technique","adaptive step-size scheme","frequecny-selective fading MC-CDMA channel","space-time block code","time-reversal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MC-CDMA","STBC","Time-Reversal based","Time-domain MC-CDMA receiver","Constant Modulus Algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a blind adaptive time-reversal based space-time block coded (TR-STBC) algorithm for multi-user MC-CDMA systems.

According to the nature of the terminals (either fixed/vehicular or mobile/battery-powered, in one respect, and either licensed or unlicensed in another), each user pursues a different goal in the network. Game theory is used as a possible tool to ensure optimum coexistence of users with highly conflicting interests. In the proposed game, each user is allowed to jointly set its transmit power and data rate according to a utility-maximizing criterion, where the utility is defined as the ratio of the overall throughput to the transmit power. The noncooperative Nash solution of the game is investigated and closed-form expressions for this equilibrium are derived and compared with numerical results for a decentralized resource control algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137380","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076471/5137364/05137380.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A noncooperative approach to joint rate and power control for infrastructure wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5137380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137380/","displayDocTitle":"A noncooperative approach to joint rate and power control for infrastructure wireless networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750021","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5137380/","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A noncooperative approach to joint rate and power control for infrastructure wireless networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1A2_1_53.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086962S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076471","isNumber":"5137364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076471","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5137364","articleId":"5137380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5137382,"authors":[{"name":"Gurdal Arslan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawaii, Manoa, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"firstName":"Gurdal","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37282840300"},{"name":"M.

We characterize the rates for which an equilibrium solution exists in a power game in terms of the equilibria of ldquocapacity gamesrdquo introduced in our earlier work (Arslan et al., 2007). We provide an example where the set of equilibrium rates is properly contained in the set of achievable rates. We provide a conservative estimate of the region of equilibrium rates using a minmax approach.

Two service providers lease spectrum from the regulator and set up a base station each to serve mobile subscribers.

In the game at level 1, each mobile subscriber chooses a service provider to subscribe to and whether to be a primary subscriber of its service provider and receive high-priority service or to be a secondary subscriber and receive low-priority service. In the game at level 2, each service provider chooses the quantity of spectrum to lease from the regulator and the rates at which to charge its mobile subscribers for the throughput they receive. We first analyze the game at level 1 for different models and in each case show the existence of a threshold-type Wardrop equilibrium, in which there exist thresholds that divide the region into sets of mobile subscribers that make the same decision at equilibrium. Next, assuming that the mobile subscribers act so as to give rise to the equilibrium found above, we analyze the game at level 2 and show the existence of a Nash equilibrium.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750026","htmlLink":"/document/5137385/","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A hierarchical spatial game over licenced resources","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hierarchical spatial game over licenced resources","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1A3_2_113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069941S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076471","isNumber":"5137364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076471","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5137364","articleId":"5137385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5137386,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This allows for scalable distributed operation; however, it can also enable users to pursue malicious objectives such as jamming other nodes to deny them service. We study games with two types of players: selfish and malicious transmitters. Each type is characterized by a utility function depending on throughput reward and energy cost. Furthermore, we focus on the setting where the transmitters have incomplete information regarding other transmitters' types, modeled as probabilistic beliefs. We first analyze a power-controlled MAC game in which the nodes select powers for continuous transmissions and then extend this to a random access MAC in which nodes choose transmission probabilities. For each case, the Bayesian Nash equilibrium strategies are derived for different degrees of uncertainty, and the resulting equilibrium throughput of selfish nodes is characterized. We identify conditions in which the throughput improves with increasing type uncertainty and introduce Bayesian learning mechanisms to update the type beliefs in repeated games. For unknown types and costs, we also specify the equilibrium cut-off thresholds for monotonic transmission decisions. The analysis provides insights into the optimal defense mechanisms against denial of service attacks at the MAC layer in wireless networks.","doi":"10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137394","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076471/5137364/05137394.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137364","startPage":"130","endPage":"139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAC games for distributed wireless network security with incomplete information of selfish and malicious user types","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5137394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MAC games for distributed wireless network security with incomplete information of selfish and malicious user types","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137394/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750035","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5137394/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAC games for distributed wireless network security with incomplete information of selfish and malicious user types","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1B2_4_21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090654S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076471","isNumber":"5137364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076471","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5137364","articleId":"5137394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5137398,"authors":[{"name":"Tansu Alpcan","affiliation":["Deutsche Telekom Laboratories, Berlin 10587, Germany"],"firstName":"Tansu","lastName":"Alpcan","id":"37299747800"},{"name":"Lacra Pavel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Lacra","lastName":"Pavel","id":"37296193300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4176-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4177-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5137398","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":583},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nash equilibrium","Design optimization","Pricing","Game theory","Optical control","Power control","Laboratories","Quality of service","Optical fiber networks","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nash equilibrium","optimization perspective","noncooperative games","network congestion control","wireless uplink power control","optical power control","pricing mechanisms","simple linear pricing"]}],"abstract":"The general problem of Nash equilibrium design is investigated from an optimization perspective.

The classical congestion games enjoy some very appealing properties, including the existence of a Nash equilibrium and that every improvement path is finite and leads to such a NE (also called the finite improvement property or FIP), which is also a local optimum to a potential function. On the other hand, this class of games does not model well the congestion or resource sharing in a wireless context, a prominent feature of which is spatial reuse. What this translates to in the context of a congestion game is that a user's payoff for using a resource (interpreted as a channel) is a function of the its number of its interfering users sharing that channel, rather than the total number among all users. This makes the problem quite different. We will call this the congestion game with resource reuse (CG-RR). In this paper we study intrinsic properties of such a game; in particular, we seek to address under what conditions on the underlying network this game possesses the FIP or NE. We also discuss the implications of these results when applied to wireless spectrum sharing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076471/5137364/05137399.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"179","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","doi":"10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137364","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5137399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Congestion games with resource reuse and applications in spectrum sharing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Wireless communication","Character generation","Nash equilibrium","Resource management","Cost function","Collaborative work","Delay","Context modeling","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["congestion games","spectrum sharing","Nash equilibrium","resource sharing","wireless spectrum sharing","resource reuse"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137399/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Congestion games with resource reuse and applications in spectrum sharing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5137399/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750040","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Congestion games with resource reuse and applications in spectrum sharing","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1C1_1_105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126653S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076471","isNumber":"5137364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076471","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5137364","articleId":"5137399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5137409,"authors":[{"name":"Walid Saad","affiliation":["UNIK-University Graduate Center, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Walid","lastName":"Saad","id":"37392237900"},{"name":"Zhu Han","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Han","id":"37278605300"},{"name":"Tamer Basar","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Tamer","lastName":"Basar","id":"37282738200"},{"name":"Merouane Debbah","affiliation":["Flexible Radio, SUPELEC, Alcatel-Lucent, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Merouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"},{"name":"Are Hjorungnes","affiliation":["UNIK-University Graduate Center, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Are","lastName":"Hjorungnes","id":"37270835900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4176-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4177-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5137409","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1020},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Wireless networks","Autonomous agents","Next generation networking","Routing","Military communication","Ad hoc networks","Wireless communication","Relays","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace robotics","game theory","radio networks","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unmanned air vehicles","next generation wireless network","military ad hoc network routing","receiver","hedonic coalition formation game algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5137409","abstract":"Autonomous agents such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a great potential for deployment in next generation wireless networks. While current literature has been mainly focused on the use of UAVs for connectivity enhancement and routing in military ad hoc networks, this paper proposes a novel usage model for UAVs in wireless communication networks. In the proposed model, a number of UAVs are required to collect data from a number of randomly located tasks and transmit this data wirelessly to a common receiver (such as the central command). Each task represents a queue of packets that require collection and transmission to the central receiver. This problem is modeled as a hedonic coalition formation game between the UAVs and the tasks that interact in order to form disjoint coalitions. Each formed coalition is modeled as a polling system consisting of a number of UAVs, designated as collectors, which act as a single server that moves between the different tasks present in the coalition, collects and transmits the packets to a common receiver. Within each coalition, some UAVs might also take the role as a relay for improving the packet success rate of the transmission. The proposed coalition formation algorithm allows the tasks and the UAVs to take local selfish decisions to join or leave a coalition, based on the achieved benefit, in terms of effective throughput, and the cost in terms of delay. Simulation results show how the proposed algorithm allows the UAVs and tasks to self-organize into independent coalitions, while improving the performance, in terms of average player (UAV or task) payoff, of at least 30.26% relatively to a scheme that allocates nearby tasks equally among UAVs.","doi":"10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137409","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076471/5137364/05137409.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A selfish approach to coalition formation among unmanned air vehicles in wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A selfish approach to coalition formation among unmanned air vehicles in wireless networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750050","publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5137409/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137409/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A selfish approach to coalition formation among unmanned air vehicles in wireless networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1C3_4_133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056618S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","isNumber":"5137364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076471","citationCount":"37","articleId":"5137409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5137412,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Han","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Han","id":"37278605300"},{"name":"Ninoslav Marina","affiliation":["UNIK-University Graduate Center, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Ninoslav","lastName":"Marina","id":"37283158600"},{"name":"Merouane Debbah","affiliation":["Flexible Radio, SUPELEC, Alcatel-Lucent, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Merouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"},{"name":"Are Hjorungnes","affiliation":["UNIK-University Graduate Center, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Are","lastName":"Hjorungnes","id":"37270835900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4176-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4177-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5137412","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1633},"abstract":"Physical layer security is an emerging security concept that achieves perfect secrecy data transmission between the intended network nodes, while the eavesdropping malicious nodes obtain zero information. The so-called secrecy capacity can be improved using friendly jammers that introduce extra interference to the eavesdropping malicious nodes while the interference to the intended destination is limited. In this paper, we investigate the interaction between the source that transmits the desired data and friendly jammers who assist the source by \"disguising\" the eavesdropper. In order to obtain a distributed solution, we introduce a game theoretic approach. The game is defined in such a way that the source pays the friendly jammers to interfere the eavesdropper, and, therefore, increasing its secrecy capacity. Friendly jammers charge the source with a certain price for this \"jamming service\". There is a tradeoff for the price: If the price is too low, the profit of the jammers is low; and if the price is too high, the source would not buy the \"service\" (jamming power) or would buy it from other jammers. To analyze the game outcome, we define and investigate a Stackelberg game and construct a distributed algorithm. Our analysis and simulation results show the effectiveness of friendly jamming and the tradeoff for setting the price. The fancy title comes from the fact that it is similar to a scenario where the main fellow character (the source) tries to send a dating message to a lady (the intended destination), whose \"poor\" boyfriend plays the role of the eavesdropper that may hear the message. Friends of the source, the so-called \"friendly jammers,\" try to distract the boyfriend, so that the dating message can be secretly transmitted. The game is defined in order to derive what is the optimal price that the friends can charge for this \"friendly\" action.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076471/5137364/05137412.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"294","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","doi":"10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137364","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5137412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical layer security game: How to date a girl with her boyfriend on the same table","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Physical layer","Jamming","Data security","Information security","Interference","Data communication","Game theory","Algorithm design and analysis","Distributed algorithms","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","game theory","jamming","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical layer security game","secrecy data transmission","eavesdropping malicious nodes","secrecy capacity","game theoretic approach","jamming service","Stackelberg game","distributed algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical Layer Security","Secrecy Capacity","Jamming","Game Theory","Stackelberg game"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Physical layer security game: How to date a girl with her boyfriend on the same table","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5137412/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750053","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical layer security game: How to date a girl with her boyfriend on the same table","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1C4_3_65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061282S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076471","isNumber":"5137364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076471","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5137364","articleId":"5137412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5137430,"authors":[{"name":"Gaoning He","affiliation":["T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris Technology, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Gaoning","lastName":"He","id":"37391441400"},{"name":"Hamidou Tembine","affiliation":["University of Avignon, Avignon, France"],"firstName":"Hamidou","lastName":"Tembine","id":"37392129500"},{"name":"Merouane Debbah","affiliation":["SUPELEC, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Merouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4176-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4177-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5137430","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Base stations","Interference","Symmetric matrices","Helium","Resource management","NIST","Game theory","Fading","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","OFDM modulation","Pareto analysis","resource allocation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deployment analysis","cooperative OFDM base stations","resource allocation problem","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","cooperative game","Nash bargaining solution","Pareto frontier","game theory","stochastic algorithm"]}],"abstract":"We study the resource allocation problem in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems as a cooperative game.

In this paper, we propose a distributed approach based on game theory to design cognitive MIMO transceiver in hierarchical CR networks, where primary users establish null and/or soft shaping constraints on the transmit covariance matrix of secondary users, so that the interference generated by secondary users be confined within the interference-temperature limits. We formulate the resource allocation problem among secondary users as a strategic noncooperative game, where each transmit/receive pair competes against the others to maximize the information rate over his own MIMO channel, under transmit power and/or null/soft shaping constraints. We provide a unified set of conditions that guarantee the uniqueness and global asymptotic stability of the Nash equilibrium of all the proposed games through totally distributed and asynchronous algorithms. Interestingly, the proposed algorithms overcome the main drawback of classical waterfilling based algorithms-the violation of the interference-temperature limits-and they have many of the desired features required for cognitive radio applications, such as low-complexity, distributed nature, robustness against missing or outdated updates of the users, and fast convergence behavior.","doi":"10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137432","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076471/5137364/05137432.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137364","startPage":"452","endPage":"461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Competitive optimization of cognitive radio MIMO systems via game theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5137432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Competitive optimization of cognitive radio MIMO systems via game theory","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137432/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750072","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5137432/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Competitive optimization of cognitive radio MIMO systems via game theory","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"3A2_4_137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.186612S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076471","isNumber":"5137364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076471","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5137364","articleId":"5137432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5137435,"authors":[{"name":"Gulfem Isiklar Alptekin","affiliation":["Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i \u00dcniversitesi, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Gulfem","lastName":"Isiklar Alptekin","id":"37087282768"},{"name":"Ayse Basar Bener","affiliation":["Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i \u00dcniversitesi, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ayse Basar","lastName":"Bener","id":"37064069100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4176-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4177-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5137435","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Cognitive radio","Quality of service","Licenses","Wireless networks","Resource management","Game theory","Nash equilibrium","Customer satisfaction","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","quality of service","radio networks","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secondary market architecture","cognitive radio network","rigid spectrum allocation","license holders","wireless networks","dynamic spectrum allocation","dynamic spectrum access network sharing","competitive spectrum exchange marketplace","equilibrium spectrum prices","game theoretical pricing model","Nash equilibrium","quality of service","customer satisfaction"]}],"abstract":"The traditional rigid spectrum allocation approach, which assigns fixed portions of spectrum to specific license holders for long term basis, is unable to manage the spectrum efficiently any longer. In order to fully utilize scarce spectrum resources in wireless networks, dynamic spectrum allocation becomes a promising approach. It is the cognitive radio technology that enables a dynamic spectrum access network sharing a wide range of available spectrum in an opportunistic manner. In this paper, we propose a pricing model for short-term sub-lease of unutilized spectrum bands to different service providers. We built our model on a competitive spectrum exchange marketplace. We obtain the equilibrium spectrum prices via a game theoretical pricing model. The Nash equilibrium point tells the spectrum holders the ideal price and quality of service level values where profit is maximized at the highest level of customer satisfaction. As the game model suggest, the numerical results show that the price and QoS level values of the network providers depend on the price and QoS of their own bands as well as the prices and QoS levels of their competitors' bands.","doi":"10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137435","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076471/5137364/05137435.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137435","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","startPage":"479","endPage":"483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pricing model for the secondary market architecture in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5137435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Pricing model for the secondary market architecture in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137435/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5137435/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750075","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pricing model for the secondary market architecture in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"3A3_3_85.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061252S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076471","isNumber":"5137364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076471","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5137364","articleId":"5137435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5137440,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Bennis","affiliation":["Centre of Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Bennis","id":"37299803500"},{"name":"Mael Le Treust","affiliation":["Flexible Radio, SUPELEC, Alcatel-Lucent, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Mael","lastName":"Le Treust","id":"37570245200"},{"name":"Samson Lasaulce","affiliation":["Flexible Radio, SUPELEC, Alcatel-Lucent, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Samson","lastName":"Lasaulce","id":"37284485800"},{"name":"Merouane Debbah","affiliation":["Flexible Radio, SUPELEC, Alcatel-Lucent, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Merouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"},{"name":"Jorma Lilleberg","affiliation":["Nokia, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jorma","lastName":"Lilleberg","id":"37275212500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4176-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4177-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5137440","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference channels","Nash equilibrium","Frequency","Base stations","Iterative algorithms","Sufficient conditions","Wireless networks","Game theory","NIST","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","decision theory","game theory","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sharing game","interference channel","strategic noncooperative game","Nash equilibrium","Stackelberg equilibrium","wireless network","frequency band"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of spectrum sharing where competitive operators coexist in the same frequency band.

Since jamming phenomenon can be considered as a game where a player (jammer) is playing against a user (transmitter), game theory is an appropriate tool for dealing with the jamming problem. In this paper we study how increasing number of jammers impacts the game. Namely, we consider plots with one and two jammers and as an objective function to the user we consider SINR. We show that in all the scenarii the jammers equalize the quality of the best sub-carriers for transmitter on as low level as their power constraint allows, meanwhile the user distributes his power among these jamming sub-carriers and in two jammer case the jammers employ time sharing strategies to bring the maximal harm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jamming in wireless networks: The case of several jammers","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","doi":"10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137448","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076471/5137364/05137448.pdf","startPage":"585","endPage":"592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137364","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5137448","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Jamming in wireless networks: The case of several jammers","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5137448/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750088","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jamming in wireless networks: The case of several jammers","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"3B3_4_121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050588S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076471","isNumber":"5137364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076471","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5137364","articleId":"5137448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5137452,"authors":[{"name":"Utku Ozan Candogan","affiliation":["Laboratory of Information and Decision Systems, MIT, USA"],"firstName":"Utku Ozan","lastName":"Candogan","id":"37398764900"},{"name":"Ishai Menache","affiliation":["Laboratory of Information and Decision Systems, MIT, USA"],"firstName":"Ishai","lastName":"Menache","id":"37299828200"},{"name":"Asuman Ozdaglar","affiliation":["Laboratory of Information and Decision Systems, MIT, USA"],"firstName":"Asuman","lastName":"Ozdaglar","id":"37300992700"},{"name":"Pablo A.

Each user wishes to optimize its individual network utility that incorporates a natural tradeoff between throughput and power. The channel quality of every user is affected by global and time-varying conditions at the base station, which are manifested to all users in the form of a common channel state. Assuming that all users employ stationary, state-dependent transmission strategies, we investigate the properties of the Nash equilibrium of the resulting game between users. While the equilibrium performance can be arbitrarily bad (in terms of aggregate utility), we bound the efficiency loss at the best equilibrium as a function of a technology-related parameter. Under further assumptions, we show that sequential best-response dynamics converge to an equilibrium point in finite time, and discuss how to exploit this property for better network usage.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137364","startPage":"621","endPage":"630","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076471/5137364/05137452.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Competitive scheduling in wireless collision channels with correlated channel state","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5137452/","displayDocTitle":"Competitive scheduling in wireless collision channels with correlated channel state","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750092","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Competitive scheduling in wireless collision channels with correlated channel state","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"3C2_1_75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074356S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076471","isNumber":"5137364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076471","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5137364","articleId":"5137452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5137498,"authors":[{"name":"Libin Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Geography, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Libin Zhou","id":"37087821371"},{"name":"Xiaojun Yang","affiliation":["Department of Geography, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37575837800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3460-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3461-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2334-0932"}],"articleNumber":"5137498","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5137498","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Neural networks","Remote sensing","Urban areas","Geography","Gradient methods","Satellites","Layout","Neurons","Land pollution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","gradient methods","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","terrain mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["training methods","land cover classification","artificial neural networks","gradient descent method","conjugate gradient method","quasiNewton method","Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus","Landsat ETM+ scene","urban area"]}],"doi":"10.1109/URS.2009.5137498","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076157/5137466/05137498.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Joint Urban Remote Sensing Event","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Joint Urban Remote Sensing Event","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URS.2009.5137498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A preliminary study of three training methods for land cover classification by artificial neural networks","abstract":"This paper reports our preliminary study that aims to examine the effectiveness of training methods for land cover classification by artificial neural networks.

Although the DWT-based image fusion algorithms are popular in the image fusion field, the computational load of the undecimated version of DWT is comparatively high and the artifacts of merged images with the decimated DWT are apparent.

It is essentially a spectrum estimation problem. As a consequence, complex values of a specific range cell in a SAR image stack as a function of baseline are closely related to the Fourier transform of the reflectivity function in the elevation direction. The new generation of SAR satellites, like TerraSAR-X, allow for the first time the building up of high-resolution SAR data stacks on a regular basis. TerraSAR-X in its high resolution spotlight mode provides data with 0.6 m slant range resolution. It has already been shown that persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) benefits enormously from this new quality of data. The data stacks used for PSI in urban areas can also be used to derive tomographic information. This paper presents the first demonstration of space-borne high resolution tomographic reconstruction of multiple scatterers in a resolution cell situation in urban areas. Different spectrum estimation strategies such as the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Nonlinear Least Squares estimation (NLS) are evaluated and compared using both simulated data and TerraSAR-X spotlight data over Las Vegas with special consideration of the difficulties caused by sparse and irregular samples. The nuisance of ill-conditioning is investigated and regularization tools are utilized to overcome this problem. For validation, the spectrum estimation results with TerraSAR-X data are compared to the plausible ground truth. In a second step of processing model selection criteria such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Minimum Description Length criterion (MDL) are implemented on the spectral estimates to determine the number of scatterers inside a resolution cell. The probability of correctly detecting the number of scatterers and the accuracy of the corresponding elevation estimates are evaluated from simulated data. Additionally, model selection results with TerraSAR-X data are analyzed. Finally, SAR tomography, as a straightforward extension to PSL is integrated into DLRs PSI-GENESIS processor to support deformation estimation and solve the ambiguity due to multiple scatterers inside a resolution cell. First processing results using TerraSAR-X data are presented that confirm the capability of space-borne high resolution SAR tomography for resolving multiple targets within the same azimuth-range cell and to map the 3-D scattering properties of the illuminated scene.","doi":"10.1109/URS.2009.5137534","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Joint Urban Remote Sensing Event","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076157/5137466/05137534.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URS.2009.5137534","publicationTitle":"2009 Joint Urban Remote Sensing Event","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-borne high resolution SAR tomography: experiments in urban environment using TS-X Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5137534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Space-borne high resolution SAR tomography: experiments in urban environment using TS-X Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137534/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5137534/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10746528","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-borne high resolution SAR tomography: experiments in urban environment using TS-X Data","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046247S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076157","isNumber":"5137466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076157","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5137466","articleId":"5137534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5137588,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Pacifici","affiliation":["Earth Observation Laboratory, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Pacifici","id":"37312017600"},{"name":"Fabio Del Frate","affiliation":["Earth Observation Laboratory, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Del Frate","id":"37269662900"},{"name":"William J.

Segmentation is a key and hard step in the processing of 3D point clouds, which is not perfectly solved in view of different applications. A new 3d segmentation method incorporating the advantages of nonparametric and spectral graph clustering is presented here to facilitate the task of object extraction in urban areas. This integrated method features local detection of arbitrary modes and globally optimized organization of segments concurrently, thereby making it particularly appropriate for partitioning raw airborne LiDAR data of urban areas into segments approximating semantic entities. Two examples in urban areas - flyover and vehicle are chosen as interest objects to be extracted by a classification-based step. The approach has been tested on LiDAR data of dense urban areas, and the results that are obtained have been compared with manual counts and showed us the efficiency and reliability of the strategy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Laser radar","Urban areas","Clouds","Solid modeling","Remote sensing","Image segmentation","Topology","Object detection","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne radar","feature extraction","geophysical techniques","image classification","image segmentation","optical radar","remote sensing by radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D segmentation method","urban analysis","airborne LiDAR data","image classification","3D point clouds","spectral graph clustering","integrated method features","arbitrary modes","globally optimized organization","manual counts","vehicle object extraction","flyover object extraction","urban areas"]}],"doi":"10.1109/URS.2009.5137673","publicationTitle":"2009 Joint Urban Remote Sensing Event","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Joint Urban Remote Sensing Event","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076157/5137466/05137673.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URS.2009.5137673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object extraction based on 3D-segmentation of LiDAR data by combining mean shift with normalized cuts: Two examples from urban areas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5137673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Object extraction based on 3D-segmentation of LiDAR data by combining mean shift with normalized cuts: Two examples from urban areas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137673/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10732789","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object extraction based on 3D-segmentation of LiDAR data by combining mean shift with normalized cuts: Two examples from urban areas","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"533.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051398S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2009","isNumber":"5137466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076157","citationCount":"11","articleId":"5137673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5137836,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Mouret","affiliation":["CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, France","Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, LIRIS, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Mouret","id":"37569609500"},{"name":"Christine Solnon","affiliation":["CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon","Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, LIRIS, France"],"firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Solnon","id":"37331162000"},{"name":"Christian Wolf","affiliation":["CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, France","INSA-Lyon, LIRIS, France"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37285119900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4265-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3662-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-3983"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-3991"}],"articleNumber":"5137836","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Image classification","Shape","Image resolution","Indexing","Testing","Image databases","Spatial databases","Image retrieval","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","hidden Markov models","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","hidden Markov model","symbol extraction","symbol string"]}],"abstract":"We propose to use hidden Markov models (HMMs) to classify images.

Extracting dominant colors that are prominent in a visual scenery is of utter importance since human visual system primarily uses them for perception. In this paper we address dominant color extraction as a dynamic clustering problem and use techniques based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for finding optimal (number of) dominant colors in a given color space, distance metric and a proper validity index function. The first technique, so-called Multi-Dimensional (MD) PSO, re-forms the native structure of swarm particles in such a way that they can make inter-dimensional passes with a dedicated dimensional PSO process. Therefore, in a multidimensional search space where the optimum dimension is unknown, swarm particles can seek both positional and dimensional optima. Nevertheless, MD PSO is still susceptible to premature convergences due to lack of divergence. To address this problem we then present Fractional Global Best Formation (FGBF) technique, which basically collects all promising dimensional components and fractionally creates an artificial global-best particle (aGB) that has the potential to be a better ldquoguiderdquo than the PSOpsilas native gbest particle. We finally propose an efficient color distance metric, which uses a fuzzy model for computing color (dis-) similarities over HSV (or HSL) color space. The comparative evaluations against MPEG-7 dominant color descriptor show the superiority of the proposed technique.","doi":"10.1109/CBMI.2009.11","pdfPath":"/iel5/5137795/5137796/05137838.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"188","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Seventh International Workshop on Content-Based Multimedia Indexing","publicationTitle":"2009 Seventh International Workshop on Content-Based Multimedia Indexing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CBMI.2009.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5137796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dominant Color Extraction Based on Dynamic Clustering by Multi-dimensional Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5137838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dominant Color Extraction Based on Dynamic Clustering by Multi-dimensional Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10734766","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5137838/","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dominant Color Extraction Based on Dynamic Clustering by Multi-dimensional Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"3662a181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077966S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5137795","isNumber":"5137796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5137795","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5137796","articleId":"5137838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5137947,"authors":[{"name":"Yafei Han","affiliation":["College of Underwater Acoustic Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yafei","lastName":"Han","id":"37579023900"},{"name":"Guolong Liang","affiliation":["College of Underwater Acoustic Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Guolong","lastName":"Liang","id":"37530463800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4589-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2909-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2910-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-5942"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-5977"}],"articleNumber":"5137947","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Particle filters","Fading","Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Multiple access interference","Least squares approximation","State-space methods","Acoustical engineering","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal detection","channel estimation","code division multiple access","fading channels","multiuser channels","multiuser detection","particle filtering (numerical methods)","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind adaptive multiuser detection","auxiliary particle filter algorithm","fading CDMA channel","synchronous code division multiple access system","parameter estimation","multiple access interference"]}],"abstract":"Auxiliary particle filter (APF) algorithm for blind adaptive multi-user detection (MUD) is introduced in this paper and simulation background is in synchronous code division multiple access (CDMA) system over fading channels.

Thus a non-ideal reference plane is formed and it leads to serious signal integrity problems. This paper introduces the FDTD method for analysis of signal integrity of the high-speed circuit. And the full-wave analysis of crosstalk for micro-strip lines over non-ideal reference plane is carried out by using FDTD. The crosstalk coupling mechanism is discussed. Furthermore, the numerical results demonstrate the measures for inhibiting crosstalk are effective.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089335/5138149/05138257.pdf","startPage":"506","endPage":"510","publicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5138149","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5138257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of crosstalk for micro-strip lines over non-ideal reference plane by using FDTD","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crosstalk","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Circuit simulation","Coupling circuits","Frequency","Routing","Impedance","EMP radiation effects","Space vector pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","finite difference time-domain analysis","high-speed techniques","microstrip lines","network routing","printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk coupling mechanism","microstrip lines","nonideal reference plane","FDTD","high-speed circuit design","signal traces","multilayer high-speed PCB routing","signal integrity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5138257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of crosstalk for micro-strip lines over non-ideal reference plane by using FDTD","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5138257/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10734191","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of crosstalk for micro-strip lines over non-ideal reference plane by using FDTD","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"MoM7.6-P1943.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081103S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089335","isNumber":"5138149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089335","xplore-issue":"5138149","articleId":"5138257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5138265,"authors":[{"name":"Chan Hu","affiliation":["Dept. of Comput.

In recent years, band (feature) selection using Neural Network such as Multi-layer Forward Neural Network (MLFNN), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and Double Parallel Feedforward Neural Network (DPFNN) becomes a promising method for dimensionality reduction. In the paper, we present a novel feature selection method using the improved DPFNN (IDPFNN), where it is the RBFNN not MLFNN to keep parallel connection with the Single-layer Feedforward Neural Network (SLFNN). The algorithm combines the procedure of structure optimization with that of feature selection using a hybrid algorithm based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). An AVIRIS data set is used for evaluation of the performance of the proposed method through the experiments of feature selection and classification. The experimental results show the better effectiveness of the algorithm of IDPFNN.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138290","startPage":"673","endPage":"676","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE

Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes have been widely considered as error-correcting codes for next generation communication systems. In this paper, vehicle condition detect system (VCDS) channel coding methods were given. Then some reduced complexity decoding algorithms (BP-based, TSP, TDMP) are compared with the original BP algorithm.

When the attitude determination of rolling projectile is influenced by random disturbance, the output of neural network will replace that of UKF. The validity of hybrid algorithm is verified through the experiment, in which three low-cost micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS) accelerometers are used as strapdown inertial measurement units (IMUs) to determine rolling projectile attitude. Experiment results show that the proposed hybrid filtering algorithm is effective and robust, and it can effectively enhance the precision of state estimation and restrain the influence of dynamic random disturbance.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138398","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089335/5138149/05138398.pdf","startPage":"1231","endPage":"1235","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","publicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5138149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An UKF and PSO-based neural network hybrid algorithm for attitude determination","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5138398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"An UKF and PSO-based neural network hybrid algorithm for attitude determination","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10734268","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5138398/","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An UKF and PSO-based neural network hybrid algorithm for attitude determination","confLoc":"Xi'an","sourcePdf":"TuM3.2-P1764.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050016S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089335","isNumber":"5138149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089335","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5138149","articleId":"5138398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5138399,"authors":[{"name":"Khattab M.

IDS detects suspected patterns of network traffic on the remaining open parts through monitoring user activities (runtime gathering of data from system operations), and the subsequent analysis of these activities. The purpose of this work is to contribute ideas of finding a solution to detect attacks (intrusion) through building artificial detection system using feedforward neural networks to detect attacks with low false negative rate (which is the most important point), and low false positive rate. To do so, two feedforward neural networks architectures (one for non fuzzified data, the other for fuzzified data) are suggested, and their behaviors in detecting the attacks are studied. In this research, the suggested IDS not only has the ability to distinguish if the access is normal or attack, but also capable of distinguishing the attack type.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138399","startPage":"1236","endPage":"1241","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and

PCA is used to perform dimension reduction on human face data and LDA creates another subspace to improve discriminant of PCA features. In this paper, we propose Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as an alternative to replace Euclidean distances in classification of human face features extracted by PCA and LDA. ANN is well recognized by its robustness and good learning ability. The algorithms were evaluated using the Database of Faces which comprises 40 subjects and with a total size of 400 images. Experimental results show that ANN reasonably improves the performance of PCA and LDA method.

Unequal protection of irregular LDPC codes and sub carriers' reliability of OFDM are investigated and combined to enhance the transmission power efficiency. SNR of sub carriers is linearly quantized and defined as reliability. For the irregular LDPC block bits with higher degrees play more important role in the decoding process and hence need more protection during transmission. In the scheme, these important bits (with large degrees) are prior to be mapped to the sub carriers with higher reliabilities (SNR) in the Is' transmission. When reception fails and repeat is needed, the bits carried on the less reliable sub carriers will be in high retransmission priority since it's more likely to be error. Gaussian approximation (GA) scheme is employed to analyze asymptotic performance of the new scheme and some initial simulations are also considered. Both of the results reveal significant improvement compared with conventional method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5138149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138422","publicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089335/5138149/05138422.pdf","startPage":"1351","endPage":"1355","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel transmission scheme for irregular LDPC coded OFDM system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A novel transmission scheme for irregular LDPC coded OFDM system","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5138422/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10747579","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5138422/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel transmission scheme for irregular LDPC coded OFDM system","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"TuM6.7-P1648.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063502S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089335","isNumber":"5138149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089335","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5138149","articleId":"5138422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5138444,"authors":[{"name":"Miin-Shen Yang","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Miin-Shen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37334896100"},{"name":"Jenn-Hwai Yang","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jenn-Hwai","lastName":"Yang","id":"37578543400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2799-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2800-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"5138444","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Control charts","Neural networks","Pattern recognition","Prototypes","Mathematics","Electronic mail","Radial basis function networks","Process control","Industrial control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control charts","neurocontrollers","parameter estimation","pattern recognition","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control chart patterns","parameter estimation","RBF neural network","pattern recognition techniques","radial basis function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["control chart","pattern recognition","neural network","RBF","parameter estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5138444","abstract":"Although pattern recognition techniques have been widely applied to identify abnormal patterns in control charts, abnormal parameter value is difficult to be estimated.

Such evaporators however present several control problems which manifest in the form of strong interactions among the many process variables, significant dead times, tendency to open-loop instability and severe nonlinearities. In this paper, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme utilizing a proportional-integral (PI) controller in its inner loop is developed for a simulated industrial-scale five-stage evaporator using a continuous-time recurrent neural network in state space as its internal model. Input-output data obtained from closed-loop system identification experiments are used in training the network by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with automatic differentiation. A similar approach is used in developing an optimal control law for the plant based on the model predictions. The effectiveness of this scheme is tested by simulating various control problem scenarios involving set-point tracking and disturbance rejection and comparing performance with that of decentralized PI controllers developed earlier. Results show significant improvements in control performance, particularly in terms of settling time.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138477","startPage":"1662","endPage":"1667","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089335/5138149/05138477.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5138149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear model predictive control of a multistage evaporator system using recurrent neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Predictive control","Recurrent neural networks","Automatic control","Electrical equipment industry","Open loop systems","Control nonlinearities","Pi control","Proportional control","Aerospace industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","evaporation","heat systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","optimal control","PI control","predictive control","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear model predictive control","multistage evaporator system","process industries","open-loop instability","proportional-integral controller","continuous-time recurrent neural network","closed-loop system identification","optimal control","disturbance rejection","PI controllers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-effect evaporators","nonlinear model predictive control","nonlinear system identification","recurrent neural networks","automatic differentiation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5138477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear model predictive control of a multistage evaporator system using recurrent neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5138477/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10734311","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear model predictive control of a multistage evaporator system using recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"TuMP.34-P0705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075055S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089335","isNumber":"5138149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089335","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5138149","articleId":"5138477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5138497,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Sha Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Li-Sha Zhang","id":"37578527700"},{"name":"Chen-Jiang Guo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Chen-Jiang Guo","id":"37416448800"},{"name":"Jun Ding","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Jun Ding","id":"37537858300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2799-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2800-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"5138497","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Finite difference methods","Apertures","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetic coupling","Information analysis","Electromagnetic heating","Resonance","Electromagnetic measurements","Electromagnetic compatibility"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic compatibility","electromagnetic coupling","electromagnetic shielding","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD method","aperture coupling properties","shielding cavity","EMC enclosure","high-power microwave","finite-difference time-domain method","coupling electronic field","electromagnetic compatibility"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Apertures","FDTD method","coupling electronic field","shielding"]}],"abstract":"The coupling properties of an enclosure with apertures illuminated by a high power microwave (HPM) are simulated and analyzed with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method.

Some of the conventional methods may have inadequate adaptability or effectiveness for identification of different power systems. A new framework for power system identification is proposed based on an improved genetic algorithm with a logarithmic fitness function and an adaptive search space. The framework can be used for most power system models (linear or nonlinear) and can easily be performed on different models just by rebuilding corresponding map lists between the system parameters and the model coefficients. The numerical experiment and practical experiment of a 600MW steam turbine unit are conducted to examine the performance of the framework. The identification results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138542","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089335/5138149/05138542.pdf","startPage":"1946","endPage":"1951","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","publicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5138149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new framework for power system identification based on an improved genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5138542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new framework for power system identification based on an improved genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10734353","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5138542/","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new framework for power system identification based on an improved genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"TuP4.5-P1448.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109775S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089335","isNumber":"5138149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089335","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5138149","articleId":"5138542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5138544,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Kuisheng","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Feng Kuisheng","id":"37568252700"},{"name":"Li Na","affiliation":["Telecommunication Engineer Institute, Air force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Li Na","id":"37581203900"},{"name":"Xu Jiadong","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Xu Jiadong","id":"37545385100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2799-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2800-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"5138544","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Frequency","Periodic structures","Boundary conditions","Dielectric losses","Magnetic materials","Dielectric materials","Gratings","Information analysis","Surface waves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","electromagnetic wave propagation","finite element analysis","frequency selective surfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","frequency selective characteristics","dielectric periodic structure","arbitrary profiles","dispersion characteristics","dielectric frequency selective surfaces","periodic boundary condition","Floquet theorem","perfectly matched layer","incident wave","inhomogeneous boundary condition","virtual incident plane"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency selective surface","Dielectric periodic structure","FEM","PML"]}],"abstract":"The dispersion characteristics of the dielectric Frequency Selective Surfaces with arbitrary profiles are analyzed by finite element method (FEM).

Wind generating schedules in a wind farm could be efficiently accommodated by means of precise prediction of wind speed to mitigate the impact from instable wind power on power grids. Back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is a main approach for short-term of wind speed prediction. This paper proposes using momentum item to speed up the convergence rate of BPNN, and taking the advantage of the genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the structure, weights and bias of BPNN. The results of wind speed prediction with real measured wind series by using these three NNs show that GA-BP is a more effective and accurate method to predict wind speed.

The dissipation is measured at various combinations of supply voltage and precharge voltage of SRAM array. The optimized combination for minimum dissipation and speed is computed. These voltages are 620 mV and 300 mV for supply and precharge respectively. Additionally the power dissipation is also reduced by 7% to 13% by additional gating transistor and at different precharge levels. The access time is reduced to 2 ns. The reliability is improved by adding redundant rows and columns. The CMOS layout is done at 0.25 mum technology for an array size of 256times8 and 16 such arrays.","publicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089335/5138149/05138681.pdf","startPage":"2616","endPage":"2619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138681","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5138149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep submicron implementation of gating transistor power saving technique for power optimized code book SRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deep submicron implementation of gating transistor power saving technique for power optimized code book SRAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5138681/","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5138681/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10747687","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep submicron implementation of gating transistor power saving technique for power optimized code book SRAM","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"WeA6.5-P1848.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037403S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","isNumber":"5138149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089335","articleId":"5138681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5138697,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Hong Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National United University, Miaoli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Hong","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278406300"},{"name":"Chih-Peng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Sumo Enterprise Company Limited, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Peng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37577433600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2799-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2800-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"5138697","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5138697","abstract":"The purposes of this study are developed a servo drive system with fuzzy neural network (FNN) for a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive system based on digital signal processor (DSP).

approach is proposed that radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) control combined with new Smith predictor for the NCS. This approach can identify the controlled plant and adaptively adjusts weights of the controller. Because new Smith predictor does not include network delay models, therefore network delays no longer need to be measured, identified or estimated on line. Simultaneously, this new Smith predictor doesn't include the prediction model of the controlled plant, thus it doesn't need to know the exact mathematical model of the controlled plant beforehand. Thereby it is applicable to some occasions that network delays are the random, time-variant or uncertain. Based on CSMA/AMP (CAN bus), the results of the simulation show the validity of the control scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5138702/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10734436","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5138702/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Networked control systems with RBF neural network control and new Smith predictor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Networked control systems with RBF neural network control and new Smith predictor","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"WeM1.7-P0814.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134878S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089335","isNumber":"5138149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089335","xplore-issue":"5138149","articleId":"5138702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5138717,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Lun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Lun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37578941700"},{"name":"Ching-Pang Weng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Pang","lastName":"Weng","id":"37577139900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2799-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2800-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"5138717","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5138717","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Genetic algorithms","Optical design","Algorithm design and analysis","System performance","Cost function","Energy consumption","Design optimization","Fuzzy logic","Printers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrophotography","fuzzy logic","genetic algorithms","laser printers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laser electrophotographic system","optimal parameter design","fuzzy multiobjective genetic algorithm approach","cost consumption","energy consumption","fuzzy logic","linguistic mapping","decision variable","laser printer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fuzzy system","genetic algorithm","laser electrophotographic system","multi-objective constrained optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138717","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089335/5138149/05138717.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","startPage":"2786","endPage":"2791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5138149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy multi-objective genetic algorithm approach to optimal parameter design for laser electrophotographic systems","abstract":"This paper proposes a systematic approach to conduct system-level optimal parameter design for laser electrophotographic systems.

A compositive optimization model that reflects the dynamic response and pressure drop traits is developed through the analysis of thermal capacity(C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n) and time constant(tau).

Results show that optimization aimed at the compositive evaluate objective on the time constant tau and the pressure drop DeltaP of the heat sink can lead to satisfactory effects. These results may provide references to designers and further research on micro-electronic components' cooling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5138723/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10747708","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5138723/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The application of genetic algorithm for pin-fin heat sink optimization design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of genetic algorithm for pin-fin heat sink optimization design","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"WeM3.7-P0667.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068469S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089335","isNumber":"5138149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089335","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5138149","articleId":"5138723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5138724,"authors":[{"name":"Yunong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yunong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279965700"},{"name":"Dongsheng Guo","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dongsheng","lastName":"Guo","id":"37532174300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2799-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2800-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"5138724","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Quadratic programming","Robot sensing systems","Performance analysis","Manipulators","Kinematics","Information science","Paper technology","Sun","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming","manipulator kinematics","path planning","quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming","quadratic programming","robot repetitive redundancy resolution","repetitive-motion-planning","four-link planar robot arm model","computer simulation","chattering phenomenon","kinematic redundant manipulator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["linear performance index","redundant robot manipulators","quadratic program","chattering phenomenon"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates and compares the linear performance index and its linear-programming (LP) formulation for online redundancy resolution of redundant robot arms, which takes repetitive-motion-planning (RMP) as an example.

Finally, simulation results show that the proposed controller is robust with regard to plant parameter variations and external load disturbance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5138776/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10734467","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5138776/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic generation fuzzy neural network controller with supervisory control for permanent magnet linear synchronous motor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic generation fuzzy neural network controller with supervisory control for permanent magnet linear synchronous motor","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"WeMP.14-P1035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107483S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089335","isNumber":"5138149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089335","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5138149","articleId":"5138776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5138778,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Tian","affiliation":["Automation Research Center, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Yuan Tian","id":"37087261294"},{"name":"Zi Ma","affiliation":["Automation Research Center, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Zi Ma","id":"37087349653"},{"name":"Aiguo Li","affiliation":["Automation Research Center, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Aiguo Li","id":"37087487114"},{"name":"Xu Zhang","affiliation":["Automation Research Center, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Xu Zhang","id":"37087196529"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2799-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2800-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"5138778","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5138778","abstract":"Based on generalized least variance and optimal prediction theory, a novel adaptive vibration control algorithm with neural network compensation is developed to restrain periodical micro-vibration in Three Dimension (3D) scanning system.

Also the model facing the control behavior verification can be used in the electronic control unit's HIL(hardware-in-the-loop) simulation which can lessen the cost and uncertain factors in the later platform experiments. With the mode of system identification, this paper builds the dynamic model of the diesel with neural network. Aiming at the nonlinear character of the diesel with large inertia, the paper uses NARMAX(Nonlinear Auto-Regressive Moving Average with eXogenous inputs) as the main structure and uses LM(Levenberg-Marquardt) algorithm to train the network. In order to overcome the redundancy of the network structure caused by the artificial experience, this paper puts forward the Time Cycle Comparison method to determine the ranks of the input signals and uses the Optimal Brain Surgeon strategy to optimize the network structure. The simulation results proves that this method can eliminate the redundancy and improve the generalization capability of the network commendably under the same output error scopes. Comparison between the train results and the measured results shows that the dynamic model has the good real-time performances and little output error. So the model can meet the need of the system character analysis and technology application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5138836/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10734501","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5138836/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"System identification of locomotive diesel engines with autoregressive neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System identification of locomotive diesel engines with autoregressive neural network","confLoc":"Xi'an","sourcePdf":"WeP1.2-P0599.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048242S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089335","isNumber":"5138149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089335","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5138149","articleId":"5138836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5138861,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Shen","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Huaiyin Institute of Technology, Huaian, China"],"lastName":"Yi Shen","id":"37087145896"},{"name":"Yunfeng Bu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Huaiyin Institute of Technology, Huaian, China"],"lastName":"Yunfeng Bu","id":"37087598259"},{"name":"Mingxin Yuan","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Mingxin Yuan","id":"37087595759"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2799-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2800-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"5138861","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5138861","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Particle swarm optimization","Optimization methods","Genetic algorithms","Mechanical engineering","Artificial intelligence","Mathematical programming","Birds","Marine animals","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maintenance engineering","particle swarm optimisation","road building"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos particle swarm optimization","random global optimization algorithm","chaotic variables randomness","chaotic variables ergodicity","chaos disturbance","expressway pavement maintenance","pavement maintenance decision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","chaos particle swarm optimization","pavement maintenance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138861","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089335/5138149/05138861.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","startPage":"3521","endPage":"3526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5138149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel chaos particle swarm optimization (PSO) and its application in pavement maintance decision","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is a new random global optimization algorithm, and the simple PSO (SPSO) is short of high convergence speed, strong optimization ability and so on. To improve the optimization property of SPSO, a novel chaos particle swarm optimization (CPSO) algorithm is presented. The characteristics of ergodicity and randomness of chaotic variables are considered to produce the initial positions of particles. On the basis of population diversity evaluated through ldquodistance-to-average-pointrdquo, the local search is carried out for mature individuals by chaos disturbance, which is helpful for them to jump out of the local minimum. Compared with the corresponding other PSO algorithms, the function optimization results indicate that the searching properties including searching efficiency and precision of CPSO algorithm are obviously better than other PSO algorithms. Finally, aiming at the expressway pavement maintenance, the CPSO algorithm is used to optimize the pavement maintenance decision.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5138861/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10734513","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5138861/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel chaos particle swarm optimization (PSO) and its application in pavement maintance decision","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel chaos particle swarm optimization (PSO) and its application in pavement maintance decision","confLoc":"Xi'an","sourcePdf":"WeP4.4-P0507.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066953S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089335","isNumber":"5138149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089335","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5138149","articleId":"5138861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5138891,"authors":[{"name":"Pingping Yu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Pingping Yu","id":"37576499000"},{"name":"Suying Yao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Suying Yao","id":"37402574300"},{"name":"Jiangtao Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Jiangtao Xu","id":"37577831800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2799-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2800-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"5138891","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Hardware design languages","Field programmable gate arrays","Very large scale integration","Design optimization","Pipelines","Time division multiplexing","Circuits","Mirrors","CMOS image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","time division multiplexing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D lifting-based discrete wavelet transform","VLSI architecture","hardware utilization","time division multiplex design","exploited embedded mirror symmetric boundary extension","1D DWT","Verilog HDL","FPGA","CMOS image sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transform (DWT)","lifting scheme","embedded mirror symmetric boundary extension","VLSI architecture"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an efficient VLSI architecture for implementation of 2-D lifting-based discrete wavelet transform (DWT).

In general, the optimization is usually applied to feature selection because of its computational feasibility and validity. For further improving recognition accuracy and reducing selected feature dimensions, this paper presents a more rational and accurate optimization, bidirectional binary particle swarm optimization (BBPSO) algorithm for feature selection in feature level fusion target recognition system. In addition, we introduce a new evaluating function as criterion function in BBPSO feature selection method. At the last, we utilized leave-one-out method to validate the proposed method.

Various simulation results for time varying frequency of the signal reveal significant improvement in noise rejection and accuracy in obtaining the frequency and amplitude of the signal.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138928","startPage":"3853","endPage":"3858","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089335/5138149/05138928.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5138149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive unscented filtering technique and particle swarm optimization for estimation of non-stationary signal parameters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Filtering","Particle swarm optimization","Frequency estimation","Noise level","Covariance matrix","Amplitude estimation","Power harmonic filters","Measurement errors","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","Kalman filters","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive unscented Kalman filtering","particle swarm optimization","non-stationary signal parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter Extended Kalman Filter","Particle Swarm Optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5138928/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive unscented filtering technique and particle swarm optimization for estimation of non-stationary signal parameters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5138928/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10734552","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive unscented filtering technique and particle swarm optimization for estimation of non-stationary signal parameters","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"WePP.37-P0389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088493S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089335","isNumber":"5138149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089335","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5138149","articleId":"5138928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5138937,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Northeastern University, China"],"lastName":"Peng Xu","id":"37395509000"},{"name":"Jinkuan Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Northeastern University, China"],"lastName":"Jinkuan Wang","id":"37280537400"},{"name":"Cai Ling","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Northeastern University, China"],"lastName":"Cai Ling","id":"37401605000"},{"name":"Liu Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Northeastern University, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Li","id":"37578911000"},{"name":"Feng Qi","affiliation":["ESAT-TELEMIC, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium"],"lastName":"Feng Qi","id":"37309858900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2799-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2800-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"5138937","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Iterative algorithms","MIMO","OFDM","Noise reduction","Blind equalizers","Information science","Error analysis","Diversity methods","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","expectation-maximisation algorithm","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EM-based angle-domain channel estimation","MIMO-OFDM system","expectation-maximization","angle-domain algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","maximum aposteriori estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","channel estimation","angle domain","EM"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an expectation-maximization (EM) based angle-domain algorithm (EMA) channel estimation for multiple-input multiple-output with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. Although EM algorithm combined with maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator could obtain good performance, its high complexity makes this algorithm unpractical. The proposed algorithm do not require prior knowledge of the channel correlation, avoids inversion induced by LS algorithm and exploits channel coefficients irrelevance in angle domain for ignoring the small-valued channel taps and retaining only the most significant taps (MST) to reduce the effect of noise on the estimates. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm gets better performance than phase shifted orthogonal LS (PSO-LS) and EM algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138937","publicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089335/5138149/05138937.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5138149","startPage":"3895","endPage":"3899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EM-based angle-domain channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5138937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"EM-based angle-domain channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5138937/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10734558","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5138937/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EM-based angle-domain channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"WePP.46-P1498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067641S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089335","isNumber":"5138149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089335","xplore-issue":"5138149","articleId":"5138937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5138938,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Jian","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optical Communication and Light wave Technology (Ministry of Education), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wei Jian","id":"37398914000"},{"name":"Chongxiu Yu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optical Communication and Light wave Technology (Ministry of Education), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Chongxiu Yu","id":"37404657800"},{"name":"Jianxin Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Optical Communication Technologies and Networks, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Jianxin Wang","id":"37406504000"},{"name":"Jianguo Yu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Optical Communication Technologies and Networks, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Jianguo Yu","id":"37404162700"},{"name":"Lin Wang","affiliation":["Key-Laboratory of All-Optical networks & Advanced Communications Networks (Ministry of Education), Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lin Wang","id":"37578963600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2799-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2800-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"5138938","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1242},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predistortion","Resonance light scattering","Least squares approximation","Nonlinear distortion","Power amplifiers","OFDM modulation","Signal processing","Kernel","Adaptive algorithm","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","radiofrequency amplifiers","Volterra series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM adaptive digital predistortion method","RLS algorithm","LMS algorithm","least mean-square algorithm","recursive least-square algorithm","Volterra kernel","RF power amplifier","smooth convergent process","memorial nonlinear effect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Polynomial kernel","Volterra","Adaptive Digital Predistortion","RLS","LMS"]}],"abstract":"A novel adaptive digital predistortion method combines RLS (Recursive Least-Square) and LMS (Least Mean-Square) with Volterra kernel is proposed to compensate the nonlinear and memorial distortion of OFDM power amplifier. For RLS could induce unexpected modulation mistakes in small error signal, it is chosen to estimate coefficients in big error signals to ensure the high convergent speed. As soon as the value of error signal is less than defined error threshold, adaptive algorithm is changed from RLS to LMS automatically. LMS that has a stable convergence in small error signals can update coefficients in a smooth convergent process. This particular characteristic is also beneficial to hardware implementation to trace the time variability of power amplifier and compensate memorial nonlinear effects. Furthermore, the constellation distortion and spectrum characteristics of 16-QAM modulated OFDM signals with different predistortion algorithms are analyzed in detail by the simulation process. Compared with conventional single RLS or LMS predistortion algorithm, the results show that the performance of digital adaptive predistortion system could be optimized with both high speed and stability by this new method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM adaptive digital predistortion method combines RLS and LMS algorithm","publicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138938","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089335/5138149/05138938.pdf","startPage":"3900","endPage":"3903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5138149","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5138938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5138938/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"OFDM adaptive digital predistortion method combines RLS and LMS algorithm","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5138938/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10734559","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM adaptive digital predistortion method combines RLS and LMS algorithm","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"WePP.47-P1611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04046S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089335","isNumber":"5138149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089335","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5138149","articleId":"5138938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5138962,"authors":[{"name":"Guo Yunmei","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Guo Yunmei","id":"37568612900"},{"name":"Wang Li","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Wang Li","id":"37537034200"},{"name":"Wu Zhuoqi","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Wu Zhuoqi","id":"37568606600"},{"name":"Jiang Binfeng","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Jiang Binfeng","id":"37568606200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2799-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2800-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"5138962","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":787},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet analysis","Wavelet packets","Fault detection","Circuit faults","Analytical models","Mathematical model","Circuit simulation","Voltage","Frequency domain analysis","Electrical fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arcs (electric)","circuit simulation","electrical faults","fault simulation","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet packet analysis","low-voltage DC arc fault","frequency domain","time domain","MATALAB software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC arc fault","simulation","arc fault detection","Wavelet Packet Analysis"]}],"abstract":"The randomness and instantaneity of low-voltage DC arc fault make it difficult to be detected by methods in time or frequency domain.
