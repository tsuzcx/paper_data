After dividing original image into four sub-sample images, two sub-images are selected by taking into consideration of block variance singular analysis (BVSA). Then two watermarks are embedded in the selected subimages. First watermark is embedded into one of the selected sub-image by modifying the singular values. For second watermark embedding, another sub-image is transformed into wavelet packet transform domain and embedding is again done by modifying the singular values of the selected sub-bands. After embedding, modified sub-bands are mapped to their original positions for constructing watermarked sub-image. After both embedding, watermarked image is constructed by inverse sub-sampling. Experimental results show good robustness and security of the proposed scheme. A new measure BVSA is presented, which gives an image block from a set of image blocks, whose mean, standard deviation, entropy, gradient and sum of singular values is greater.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2008.112","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579839/4579840/04580020.pdf","startPage":"850","endPage":"855","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2008.112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual Watermarking Scheme via Sub-Sampling in WPT-SVD Domain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Dual Watermarking Scheme via Sub-Sampling in WPT-SVD Domain","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4580020/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141280","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580020/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual Watermarking Scheme via Sub-Sampling in WPT-SVD Domain","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"3267a850.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055146S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579839","isNumber":"4579840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579839","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4579840","articleId":"4580020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4580028,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

The wavelet analysis can be used as a tool for providing discriminative features with small dimensions to classify different disturbances in HVDC transmission system. This paper explores the application of wavelet based multi-resolution analysis (MRA) for signal decomposition to monitor some of the faults (e.g.- L-G fault, DC line fault, commutation failure) in the HVDC system. The faults in HVDC system can be classified by monitoring the signals both on AC and DC sides of the HVDC system like Inverter side AC phase currents, DC voltage, DC current, valve currents. The fault classifier can be developed from these monitored signals which show promising features to classify different disturbances in the HVDC System. The simulation results are also presented to verify the performance of the proposed method. The method has been used to classify different faults as well as to identify faulted phase(s) and valve(s) in case of AC faults and commutation failure respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Valves","Signal resolution","Feature extraction","Wavelet transforms","Energy resolution","HVDC transmission","Multiresolution analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","HVDC power convertors","HVDC power transmission","power system security","power transmission faults","signal classification","signal resolution","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault identification","HVDC converter","wavelet based multiresolution analysis","fault classification","electric power system","HVDC transmission system","signal decomposition","fault monitoring","wavelet transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HVDC System","Faults in HVDC System","Wavelet Transformation","Multi-resolution Analysis","Fault Classifier"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2008.150","startPage":"954","endPage":"959","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579839/4579840/04580040.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2008.150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of Fault in HVDC Converters Using Wavelet Based Multi-Resolution Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Identification of Fault in HVDC Converters Using Wavelet Based Multi-Resolution Analysis","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10141300","publicationDate":"July 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4580040/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of Fault in HVDC Converters Using Wavelet Based Multi-Resolution Analysis","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"3267a954.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038062S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579839","isNumber":"4579840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579839","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4579840","articleId":"4580040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4580042,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This routing protocol functions without any need for fixed infrastructure or base station. It has the following advantages like low processing rate, memory overhead, and low network utilization. In spite of these advantages, AODV suffers from the limitation of low bandwidth i.e., used for long period when bandwidth is low. The improved AODV routing protocol with route repair scheme overcomes the disadvantages of its predecessor. In the earlier AODV routing protocol, wherever a link breaks an error message is sent to the source stating that a link failure has taken place and further communication is stopped temporarily. Where as in the improved version, nodes in the active path between source and destination act as a virtual source when link breakage occurs and there by the search process is continued till the link is formed to reach the original destination is reached. Comparison between original routing protocol and the improved algorithm is carried out by simulating them in MODELSim, simulation software and the VHDL coding is implemented in FPGA Virtex-IV kit.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579839/4579840/04580043.pdf","startPage":"971","endPage":"974","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2008.175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2008.175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4580043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA Implementation of Improved AODV Routing Protocol for Route Repair Scheme","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing protocols","Ad hoc networks","Distance measurement","Routing","Maintenance engineering","Protocols","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","field programmable gate arrays","mobile computing","routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","AODV routing protocol","route repair scheme","ad hoc on demand distance vector","mobile ad hoc network","mobile node","network utilization","virtual source","simulation software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AODV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA Implementation of Improved AODV Routing Protocol for Route Repair Scheme","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4580043/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141303","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA Implementation of Improved AODV Routing Protocol for Route Repair Scheme","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"3267a971.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043029S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579839","isNumber":"4579840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579839","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4579840","articleId":"4580043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4580048,"authors":[{"name":"Vrinda Parkhi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Vrinda","lastName":"Parkhi","id":"38093498600"},{"name":"Swati Shilaskar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Swati","lastName":"Shilaskar","id":"38093497100"},{"name":"Milind Tirmare","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Milind","lastName":"Tirmare","id":"38093497200"},{"name":"Milind Jog","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Milind","lastName":"Jog","id":"38098595300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3267-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0477"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0485"}],"articleNumber":"4580048","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":408},"abstract":"The primary function of any adjustable speed motor drive is to control the speed, torque, acceleration, deceleration and direction of rotation of machine.

An alternative error correcting strategy not suffering from the disadvantages of using ARQ is the introduction of a forward error correcting (FEC) code. In this paper, forward error correcting codes called Raptor codes (a class of Fountain codes) are applied for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing(OFDM) systems, which is a popular multi-carrier modulation technique in broadband communications and is currently being used in the IEEE 802.16e (Wi-Max) standard.

Measurement of Fetal Anatomies from Ultrasound Images using a Constrained Probabilistic Boosting Tree","abstract":"We propose a novel method for the automatic detection and measurement of fetal anatomical structures in ultrasound images. This problem offers a myriad of challenges, including: difficulty of modeling the appearance variations of the visual object of interest, robustness to speckle noise and signal dropout, and large search space of the detection procedure. Previous solutions typically rely on the explicit encoding of prior knowledge and formulation of the problem as a perceptual grouping task solved through clustering or variational approaches. These methods are constrained by the validity of the underlying assumptions and usually are not enough to capture the complex appearances of fetal anatomies. We propose a novel system for fast automatic detection and measurement of fetal anatomies that directly exploits a large database of expert annotated fetal anatomical structures in ultrasound images. Our method learns automatically to distinguish between the appearance of the object of interest and background by training a constrained probabilistic boosting tree classifier. This system is able to produce the automatic segmentation of several fetal anatomies using the same basic detection algorithm. We show results on fully automatic measurement of biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), femur length (FL), humerus length (HL), and crown rump length (CRL). Notice that our approach is the first in the literature to deal with the HL and CRL measurements. Extensive experiments (with clinical validation) show that our system is, on average, close to the accuracy of experts in terms of segmentation and obstetric measurements. Finally, this system runs under half second on a standard dual-core PC computer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580125/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10185700","pubMedId":"18753047","volume":"27","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4580125/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detection and Measurement of Fetal Anatomies from Ultrasound Images using a Constrained Probabilistic Boosting Tree","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and Measurement of Fetal Anatomies from Ultrasound Images using a Constrained Probabilistic Boosting Tree","sourcePdf":"27tmi09-carneiro.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108383S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"4608888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"4608888","articleId":"4580125","onlineDate":"29 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4580152,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Although designing SoCs is challenging, SoC models such as systems integrating modules with predefined physical links (SIMPPL) exist to facilitate the design process. SIMPPL leverages defined physical interfaces and communication protocols to enable rapid system-level integration for application-specific architectures. This paper presents a ldquoSIMPPL repeaterrdquo that enables the SIMPPL SoC architectural framework to be used for systems spanning multiple FPGAs.

This paper proposes a high-performance NSP intended for both IPSec and SSL protocols acceleration. With a programmable descriptor-based instruction set architecture, the novel design of system architecture leads to a Gbps rate NSP named Zodiac, which is programmable with domain specific instructions for Gbps throughput IPSec and SSL applications. Synthesized with a 0.18 mum CMOS technology, the peak throughput of IPSec ESP tunnel mode can reach up to 1.651 Gbps and over 1000 full SSL handshakes per second are attainable.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569858/4580144/04580160.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"96","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2008.4580160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2008.4580160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580144","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4580160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zodiac: System architecture implementation for a high-performance Network Security Processor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Engines","Computer architecture","Arrays","Protocols","Security","Three dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","cryptographic protocols","microcomputers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system architecture implementation","high-performance network security processor","application-specific processors","cryptographic operations","network security protocols","programmable descriptor-based instruction set architecture","domain specific instructions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580160/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Zodiac: System architecture implementation for a high-performance Network Security Processor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4580160/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130305","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zodiac: System architecture implementation for a high-performance Network Security Processor","confLoc":"Leuven, Belgium","sourcePdf":"16_Wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044337S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569858","isNumber":"4580144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569858","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4580144","articleId":"4580160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4580163,"authors":[{"name":"Ishaan L.

Evaluation of high-dimensional integrals is commonly required in scientific fields as well as other areas (such as finance), and is performed by stochastic Monte Carlo simulations. Simulations which use quasi-random numbers can achieve faster convergence and better accuracy than simulations using conventional pseudo-random numbers. Such simulations are called Quasi-Monte Carlo. Conventional Monte Carlo simulations are increasingly implemented on reconfigurable devices such as FPGAs due to their inherently parallel nature. This has not been possible for Quasi-Monte Carlo simulations because, to our knowledge, no low-discrepancy sequences have been generated in hardware before. We present FPGA-optimized scalable designs to generate three different common low-discrepancy sequences: Sobol, Niederreiter and Halton. We implement these three generators on Virtex-4 FPGAs with varying degrees of fine-grained parallelization, although our ideas can be applied to a far broader class of sequences. We conclude with results from the implementation of an actual Quasi-Monte Carlo simulation for extracting partial inductances from integrated circuits.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2008.4580163","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569858/4580144/04580163.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2008.4580163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580144","startPage":"108","endPage":"113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low discrepancy sequences for Monte Carlo simulations on reconfigurable platforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4580163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low discrepancy sequences for Monte Carlo simulations on reconfigurable platforms","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580163/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130308","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4580163/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low discrepancy sequences for Monte Carlo simulations on reconfigurable platforms","confLoc":"Leuven, Belgium","sourcePdf":"19_Harwayne-Gidansky.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065522S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569858","isNumber":"4580144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569858","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4580144","articleId":"4580163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4580164,"authors":[{"name":"Yves Vanderperren","affiliation":["ESAT-MICAS, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Vanderperren","id":"37298178900"},{"name":"Wim Dehaene","affiliation":["ESAT-MICAS, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Wim","lastName":"Dehaene","id":"37271994200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1897-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1898-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6862"}],"articleNumber":"4580164","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Arrays","Receivers","Registers","Demodulation","Computer architecture","Schedules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulators","singular value decomposition","systolic arrays","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible digital architecture","pulsed ultra-wideband demodulator","Nyquist rate","singular value decomposition","configurable systolic array","automatic code generation"]}],"abstract":"A flexible digital architecture for a pulsed ultra-wideband demodulator sampling below Nyquist rate is presented.

This enables formation of the regular expression hardware by a simple cascade of generic blocks as well as a possibility for reconfiguring the generic blocks to change the regular expression being matched. Further, we have developed an HDL code generator to obtain the VHDL description of the hardware for any regular expression set.

The proposed structure for 3-D DWT provides higher throughput than the existing architecture; and involves nearly half or less the number of multipliers and adders; and less on-chip memory (when normalized for unit throughput rate) than the other. Most importantly, the proposed one does not require any frame buffer unlike the other to perform inter-frame DWT computation.

It differs fundamentally from other MIMO communication since the signals received from each node have a relative timing and frequency offset due to the distributed nature of their transmitting antennas. Therefore, the receiver must estimate the timing and frequency for each transmitting node, in addition to the MIMO channel. In this paper, we design and implement a receiver for the cooperative MIMO problem using reconfigurable hardware. We discuss the computation required for each stage of the receiver and perform experimental study of the tradeoffs between area, power, performance and quality of results.

Among the different techniques proposed, the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FD-TD) method has the advantage of a feasible hardware implementation that can significantly speed up the computations. This technique is widely used for the solution of partial differential equations in a variety of areas such as antennas design, medical studies, circuit packaging and non-destructive evaluation. In this paper, we present a hardware accelerator of a 3D FD-TD heat equation solver that constitutes the basis of a thermal model of the soil for the non-destructive evaluation of minefields using infrared thermography techniques. In order to be able to work on the field during mine removal activities, a portable and computationally efficient system must be achieved. To this aim, we projected the 3D FD-TD model of the soil onto an FPGA platform using Handel-C and VHDL. A speedup factor of 34 over a single precision PC (C++) is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2008.4580175","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569858/4580144/04580175.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2008.4580175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580144","startPage":"179","endPage":"184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based hardware accelerator of the heat equation with applications on infrared thermography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4580175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based hardware accelerator of the heat equation with applications on infrared thermography","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580175/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10140779","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4580175/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based hardware accelerator of the heat equation with applications on infrared thermography","confLoc":"Leuven, Belgium","sourcePdf":"31_Pardo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076444S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569858","isNumber":"4580144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569858","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4580144","articleId":"4580175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4580178,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Lee","affiliation":["Applied Science, Simon Fraser University, Canada"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Lee","id":"37676957800"},{"name":"Lesley Shannon","affiliation":["Applied Science, Simon Fraser University, Canada"],"firstName":"Lesley","lastName":"Shannon","id":"37299243200"},{"name":"Matthew J.

However, floating point operators are also hardware resource intensive and require longer latencies than fixed point operators to complete. Due to the reduced logic density of FPGAs relative to ASICs, it is often only possible to accelerate a portion of a floating point application in hardware. This paper presents an application-specific architecture for the hardware acceleration of a complete Fourier Integral Operator (FIO) kernel used in seismic imaging on a multi-FPGA platform. The design utilizes several floating point computing elements (CEs) to calculate the FIO kernel in parallel stages on multiple FPGAs. A detailed study of floating point CEs, including a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) CE, and a complete FIO prototype implementation on the BEE2 platform is described. The prototype implementation has a 12.4x increase in throughput over an optimized software implementation, and a predicted 15.8x increase in throughput on the BEE3 platform.","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569858/4580144/04580178.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-FPGA application-specific architecture for accelerating a floating point Fourier Integral Operator","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2008.4580178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2008.4580178","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4580178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A multi-FPGA application-specific architecture for accelerating a floating point Fourier Integral Operator","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130275","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4580178/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-FPGA application-specific architecture for accelerating a floating point Fourier Integral Operator","confLoc":"Leuven, Belgium","sourcePdf":"34_Lee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068313S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569858","isNumber":"4580144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569858","xplore-issue":"4580144","articleId":"4580178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4580179,"authors":[{"name":"Ka Fai Cedric Yiu","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics Kowloon, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ka Fai Cedric","lastName":"Yiu","id":"38181160400"},{"name":"Chun Hok Ho","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, England"],"lastName":"Chun Hok Ho","id":"37578717400"},{"name":"Nedelko Grbric","affiliation":["Blekinge Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Ronneby, Sweden"],"firstName":"Nedelko","lastName":"Grbric","id":"38095378000"},{"name":"Yao Lu","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics Kowloon, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yao Lu","id":"38090144800"},{"name":"Xiaoxiang Shi","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics Kowloon, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoxiang Shi","id":"38085019800"},{"name":"Wayne Luk","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, England"],"firstName":"Wayne","lastName":"Luk","id":"37272281200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1897-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1898-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6862"}],"articleNumber":"4580179","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphones","Speech","Noise","Frequency domain analysis","Hardware","Magnetic cores","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","microphone arrays","spatial filters","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable acceleration","microphone array algorithms","speech enhancement","noise reduction","ambient noise signals","spatial filtering","subband beamforming algorithms","hardware architecture","bitwidth optimization","Xilinx XC4VSX55 FPGA"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable acceleration of microphone array algorithms for speech enhancement","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2008.4580179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580144","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569858/4580144/04580179.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2008.4580179","startPage":"203","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4580179","abstract":"Microphone arrays play an important role in noise reduction and speech enhancement.

To support various 4G standards, a configurable multi-mode MAP (maximum a posteriori) decoder is designed for both binary and duo-binary turbo codes with small resource overhead (less than 10%) compared to the single-mode architecture. To achieve high data rates in 4G, we present a parallel turbo decoder architecture with scalable parallelism tailored to the given throughput requirements. High-level parallelism is achieved by employing contention-free interleavers. Multi-banked memory structure and routing network among memories and MAP decoders are designed to operate at full speed with parallel interleavers. We designed a very low-complexity recursive on-line address generator supporting multiple interleaving patterns, which avoids the interleaver address memory. Design trade-offs in terms of area and power efficiency are explored to find the optimal architectures. A 711 Mbps data rate is feasible with 32 Radix-4 MAP decoders running at 200 MHz clock rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569858/4580144/04580180.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"214","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2008.4580180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2008.4580180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580144","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4580180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Configurable and scalable high throughput turbo decoder architecture for multiple 4G wireless standards","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Computer architecture","Throughput","Logic gates","Binary codes","Random access memory","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","binary codes","interleaved storage","logic design","maximum likelihood decoding","network routing","parallel architectures","storage allocation","telecommunication standards","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi code turbo decoder architecture","4G wireless standard","configurable multimode MAP decoder","maximum a posteriori","duo-binary turbo code","parallel turbo decoder architecture","high-level parallelism","contention-free interleaver","multi banked memory structure","routing network","low-complexity recursive online address generator","interleaver address memory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Configurable and scalable high throughput turbo decoder architecture for multiple 4G wireless standards","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4580180/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130277","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Configurable and scalable high throughput turbo decoder architecture for multiple 4G wireless standards","confLoc":"Leuven, Belgium","sourcePdf":"36_Sun.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066107S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569858","isNumber":"4580144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569858","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4580144","articleId":"4580180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4580181,"authors":[{"name":"Marcos B.S.

Our results show that ADRES outperforms TI C64x DSP, executing the AES algorithm in one fourth of the cycles.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580144","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569858/4580144/04580186.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2008.4580186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2008.4580186","startPage":"245","endPage":"250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping of the AES cryptographic algorithm on a Coarse-Grain reconfigurable array processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580186/","displayDocTitle":"Mapping of the AES cryptographic algorithm on a Coarse-Grain reconfigurable array processor","htmlLink":"/document/4580186/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2008","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10130284","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping of the AES cryptographic algorithm on a Coarse-Grain reconfigurable array processor","confLoc":"Leuven, Belgium","sourcePdf":"42_Garcia.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085468S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569858","isNumber":"4580144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569858","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4580144","articleId":"4580186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4580192,"authors":[{"name":"Pepijn de Langen","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Pepijn","lastName":"de Langen","id":"37937168800"},{"name":"Ben Juurlink","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Juurlink","id":"37267125200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1897-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1898-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6862"}],"articleNumber":"4580192","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":59},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory copies in multi-level memory systems","abstract":"Data movement operations, such as the C-style memcpy function, are often used to duplicate or communicate data.

We demonstrate the idea with a multi-mode decoder that can decode baseline, main and high profile H.264 streams and can interoperate at run.time across these profiles. The decoder is capable of processing frame sizes of up to 1024\u00d7768 at 30 fps.

The problem of PD signal recognition has been approached in a number of ways. Most of the approaches are based on laboratory experiments or on signals acquired during off-line tests of industrial apparatus. On-line testing is vastly preferable as the equipment can remain in service, and the operators can monitor the insulation condition continuously. Interferences from noise sources have been a persistent problem, which have increased with the advent of solid-state power switching electronics. Use of wavelet transform technique offers many advantages over conventional digital filters and is ideally suited to process non- stationary signals (transients) often encountered in high voltage testing and measurements. In this paper, an empirical wavelet- based method is proposed to recover PD pulses mixed with excessive noise/interference. A critical assessment of the proposed method is carried out by processing simulated PD signals along with noise signals using MAT LAB software.","doi":"10.1109/CMD.2008.4580476","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Condition Monitoring and Diagnosis","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Condition Monitoring and Diagnosis","pdfPath":"/iel5/4560066/4580203/04580476.pdf","startPage":"1104","endPage":"1107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMD.2008.4580476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wavelet transform technique for de-noising partial discharge signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4580476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580476/","displayDocTitle":"A wavelet transform technique for de-noising partial discharge signals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10118751","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4580476/","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wavelet transform technique for de-noising partial discharge signals","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"K2-09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031976S","chronDate":"21-24 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4560066","isNumber":"4580203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4560066","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4580203","articleId":"4580476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4580518,"authors":[{"name":"Abolfazl Salami","affiliation":["Arak Engineering and Technical Department, Iran University of Science and Technology, Arak, Iran"],"firstName":"Abolfazl","lastName":"Salami","id":"37294435400"},{"name":"Parvaneh Pahlevani","affiliation":["Arak Engineering and Technical Department, Iran University of Science and Technology, Arak, Iran"],"firstName":"Parvaneh","lastName":"Pahlevani","id":"38095281900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1621-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1622-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4580518","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":450},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fault diagnosis","Partial discharges","Current transformers","Cables","Costs","Frequency response","Permeability","Crystalline materials","Transformer cores"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","chemical analysis","electric machine analysis computing","fault diagnosis","neural nets","power transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","dissolved gas analysis","power transformer","artificial neural networks applications","historical transformer failure data","multilayer perceptron neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Back propagation","Condition monitoring","Dissolved gas analysis","fault diagnostics","Neural network","Power transformers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4580518","abstract":"Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is one of the most useful techniques to detect the incipient faults of power transformer.

The source of vibration is assumed to be sinusoidal and vibration isolation is achieved when the total transmitted force to the foundation is minimized. By training the controller online EMRAN has the ability to add and prune the number of hidden layer neurons of its network based on a certain criteria that needs to be satisfied.

An all-IP network architecture with reliable high-throughput air interface make orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA) based mobile worldwide interoperability for microwave access (mobile WiMAX) a viable technology for wireless multimedia services, such as voice over IP (VoIP), mobile TV, and so on. In this article, we first give an overview of the key aspects of WiMAX and describe multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS) architecture of the 3GPP. We propose a framework for combined real-time behaviors and stochastic process algebra. This is done with a modeling language, called real-time stochastic process algebra (RT-SPA), for describing the real-time stochastic behaviors of wireless networks. This methodology can then be analyzed using an automatic tool. With this performance analysis methodology it is possible to obtain the design parameters of implementation using simulation with a lower computational time and cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569830/4580554/04580592.pdf","startPage":"180","endPage":"186","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580554","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4580592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance modelling and evaluation of OFDMA based WiMAX systems using RT-SPA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Streaming media","Stochastic processes","Wireless networks","Algebra","OFDM","Microwave technology","Internet telephony","Mobile TV","Digital multimedia broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP networks","mobile radio","multicast communication","multimedia communication","OFDM modulation","open systems","stochastic processes","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA based WiMAX systems","RT-SPA","multimedia stream service","broadband wireless networks","all-IP network architecture","high-throughput air interface","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access","mobile worldwide interoperability","microwave access","mobile WiMAX","wireless multimedia services","voice over IP","mobile TV","multimedia broadcast multicast service architecture","3GPP","modeling language","real-time stochastic process algebra","real-time stochastic behaviors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance modelling and evaluation of OFDMA based WiMAX systems using RT-SPA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4580592/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10130076","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance modelling and evaluation of OFDMA based WiMAX systems using RT-SPA","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"98F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037076S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569830","isNumber":"4580554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569830","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4580554","articleId":"4580592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4580597,"authors":[{"name":"Almas Uddin Ahmed","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Application Engineer, MyKris Asia Sdn.

From the simulations we observe that the codes PCB based on BCH(127,106,7) and BCH(255,215,11) codes are respectively 1.7 dB and 2.1 dB from Shannon limit.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580602/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4580602/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10130086","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Iterative decoding of parallel concatenated block codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative decoding of parallel concatenated block codes","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"131F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031081S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569830","isNumber":"4580554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569830","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4580554","articleId":"4580602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4580604,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this work we apply the knowledge of digital image processing, fuzzy logic and neural network technique to detect bifurcation and vein-artery cross-over points in fundus images. The acquired images undergo preprocessing stage for illumination equalization and noise removal. Segmentation stage clusters the image into two distinct classes by the use of fuzzy c-means technique, neural network technique and modified cross-point number (MCN) methods were employed for the detection of bifurcation and cross-over points. MCN uses a 5x5 window with 16 neighboring pixels for efficient detection of bifurcation and cross over points in fundus images. Result obtained from applying this hybrid method on both real and simulated vascular points shows that this method perform better than the existing simple cross-point number (SCN) method, thus an improvement to the vascular point detection and a good tool in the monitoring and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580604/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10130088","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4580604/","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detection of vascular intersection in retina fundus image using modified cross point number and neural network technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of vascular intersection in retina fundus image using modified cross point number and neural network technique","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"135F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050388S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569830","isNumber":"4580554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569830","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4580554","articleId":"4580604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4580608,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The channel is assumed to be constant during one OFDM symbol but evolves in time according to the first-order Markov process.

Each of these patterns is unique and located in specific location in the brain. The main aim of analyzing these datasets is to localize the areas of the brain that have been activated in a given experiment. The basic analysis involves carrying out a statistical test for activation at thousands of locations in the brain. In this paper an attempt is made to develop and train classifiers based on the subjectspsila fMRI sequences in order to predict the tasks performed. The fMRI data set is huge and also the data size for different tasks is dimensionally dissimilar. Dimensionality reduction of high dimensional data is useful for three general reasons; it reduces computational requirements for subsequent operations on the data, eliminates redundancies in the data, and, in cases where the feature data set dimensionality doesnpsilat match then a common dimension is to be arrived at with the available data. All three reasons apply here, and motivate the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a standard method for creating uncorrelated variables from best-fitting linear combinations of the variables in the raw data. The depth information data is extracted using Statistical Parametric mapping (SPM). The templates comprising of principal components represent individual activity. These are then fed to the back propagation training algorithm. The trained network is capable of classifying the test pattern into the corresponding defined class.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Pattern classification","Brain","Data engineering","Decoding","Educational institutions","Data analysis","Testing","Principal component analysis","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","biomedical MRI","medical image processing","pattern classification","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","pattern classification","fMRI activation maps","functional MRI","fMRI sequences","principal component analysis","PCA","statistical parametric mapping","SPM","back propagation training algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580614","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569830/4580554/04580614.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network approach towards pattern classification using fMRI activation maps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4580614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Neural network approach towards pattern classification using fMRI activation maps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580614/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4580614/","accessionNumber":"10130098","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network approach towards pattern classification using fMRI activation maps","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"156F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054492S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569830","isNumber":"4580554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569830","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4580554","articleId":"4580614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4580651,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

The concept uses the correlation properties and bit streaming for reduced complexity architecture to meet real time requirement for asynchronous multiuser detection in wireless communication. To mitigate the effect of multiple access interference (MAI), we propose a multiplication and subtraction (multisub) of cross correlation factor with receiving signal at output of matched filter, which is the first stage of parallel interference cancellation (PIC) multistage multiuser detector. Typically, asynchronous multiuser detector uses multishot detection, which involves block based computations and matrix inversions. Hence, multisub correlation based suboptimal scheme have been evaluated to decrease the computational complexity and eliminate the need for matrix inversion. Moreover, such novel scheme can have added advantage to avoiding multishot detection if they start from a matched filter outputs. The result of the paper shows that performance of the limited parallel interference cancellation (PIC) multistage multiuser detector improves in that of other schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580698","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569830/4580554/04580698.pdf","startPage":"716","endPage":"720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited multiuser detection technique using multisub of correlation Factor for DS- CDMA System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4580698","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580698/","displayDocTitle":"Limited multiuser detection technique using multisub of correlation Factor for DS- CDMA System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10130179","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4580698/","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited multiuser detection technique using multisub of correlation Factor for DS- CDMA System","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"361F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064003S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569830","isNumber":"4580554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569830","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4580554","articleId":"4580698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4580703,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The main idea behind the proposed system is the beam forming of both the uplink and downlink according to the locations of sources or users which are being estimated by an efficient direction of arrival (DOA) estimator which covers the full azimuth range. In this way, the system will work as a spatial filter to reduce the co-channel and noise interference. An improved version of root-MUSIC algorithm is suggested to estimate the DOA information using N-elements uniform circular array (UCA). The proposed receiver structure is validated through simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WCDMA receiver structure with Smart Antennas System","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580738","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569830/4580554/04580738.pdf","startPage":"911","endPage":"914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580554","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4580738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"WCDMA receiver structure with Smart Antennas System","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4580738/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10119021","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WCDMA receiver structure with Smart Antennas System","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"473F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043033S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569830","isNumber":"4580554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569830","xplore-issue":"4580554","articleId":"4580738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4580748,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Askari","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Department, Islamic Azad University, Omidiyeh, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Askari","id":"38097498800"},{"name":"Reza Saadat","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Yazd University, Yazd, Iran"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Saadat","id":"37545882200"},{"name":"Mansour Nakhkash","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Yazd University, Yazd, Iran"],"firstName":"Mansour","lastName":"Nakhkash","id":"38294670700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1691-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1692-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4580748","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Multiaccess communication","Bandwidth","Channel capacity","Multimedia systems","Costs","Binary trees"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","channel coding","code division multiple access","orthogonal codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code assignment","call blocking probability","call reassignment","wideband code division multiple access","system capacity","channelization code","orthogonal variable spreading factor","spectral efficiency","code blocking"]}],"abstract":"This research compares the performance of static and dynamic OVSF code assignment schemes, in terms of call blocking probability and number of required call reassignment. In wideband code division multiple access (CDMA), in order to increasing system capacity, channelization codes are used to preserve the orthogonality between physical channels. The orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) codes are used as the channelization codes in this system. The spectral efficiency of the system depends on the code assignment schemes.

In non-ideal communication channels, signal quality deteriorates if the transmission rate and distance is pushed to the limit of the channel. Furthermore, in wireless channel, the effect of multipath propagation causes the transmitted signal to be superimposed, attenuated, and delayed at the receiver, which further deteriorates the signal. The problem, which is termed Intersymbol Interference (ISI), is overcome using channel equalizers. In addition to this, channel characteristics also vary with time, which requires the equalizer to adapt to the channel. This work presents the design of adaptive equalizer as applied in wireless systems as to achieve error proof data communication. The adaptive equalizer is designed using VHDL, and synthesized to TSMC 0.25 mum process technology with a proposed circuit architecture based on the least mean square (LMS) adaptive algorithm and linear FIR filter structure. From results obtained, the VLSI adaptive equalizer can successfully equalize distorted signals with ISI.

The applications of tomography techniques as a robust non-invasive tool for direct analysis of the characteristics of multiphase flows have increased. One of the famous real time techniques that are usually applied was ultrasonic tomography. In this study, ultrasonic tomographic imaging sensor has been utilised to visualize the distribution of liquid/gas in a vertical column. The sensing element consists of 32 units of ultrasonic transceivers to cover the pipe cross-section. The motivation of the paper is to analyse the performance of the transceiver methods in visualising bubble hold-ups in vertical column. Some analyses have been carried out using several phantoms and the system was found excellent in visualizing the internal characteristics and provides the concentration profile for the corresponding phantoms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569830/4580554/04580786.pdf","startPage":"1147","endPage":"1150","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580554","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4580786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasonic process tomographic imaging sensor: An approach utilising transceivers method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tomography","Ultrasonic imaging","Image sensors","Transceivers","Visualization","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Imaging phantoms","Robustness","Gas detectors","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic tomography","bubbles","multiphase flow","phantoms","pipe flow","transceivers","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["utrasonic process tomographic imaging sensor","process plant","multiphase flows","liquid distribution","gas distribution","vertical column","ultrasonic transceivers","pipe cross-section","bubble hold-ups","concentration profile","phantoms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonic process tomographic imaging sensor: An approach utilising transceivers method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4580786/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10129998","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasonic process tomographic imaging sensor: An approach utilising transceivers method","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"628F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051654S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569830","isNumber":"4580554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569830","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4580554","articleId":"4580786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4580797,"authors":[{"name":"Husagic Alma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, International Islamic University Malaysia, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Husagic","lastName":"Alma","id":"38317183400"},{"name":"Wajdi Al-Khateeb","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, International Islamic University Malaysia, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Wajdi","lastName":"Al-Khateeb","id":"37547499700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1691-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1692-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4580797","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":553},"abstract":"Free space optics (FSO) is a promising optical technology that has a great chance to compliment the traditional wireless communications, through provision of high bandwidth, excellent security and reaching places where cable technology could never reach.

It is used to collect the information from tissue samples regarding gene expression differences that could be useful for cancer classification. However, this classification task faces many challenges due to availability of a smaller number of samples compared to the huge number of genes, and many of the genes are not relevant to the classification. It has been shown that selecting a small subset of genes can lead to an improved accuracy of the classification. Hence, this paper proposes a solution to the problem of gene selection by using a multi-objective approach in genetic algorithm. This approach is experimented on two microarray data sets such as lung cancer and mixed-lineage leukemia cancer. It obtains encouraging result on those data sets as compared with an approach that uses single objective approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580821","startPage":"1331","endPage":"1334","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569830/4580554/04580821.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimization using genetic algorithm for gene selection from microarray data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Cancer","Space technology","Gene expression","Filters","Data engineering","Genetic engineering","Computer science","Intelligent systems","Software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","cancer","genetic algorithms","genetics","medical computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization","genetic algorithm","gene selection","microarray data","tissue sample","gene expression","cancer classification","lung cancer","mixed-lineage leukemia cancer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimization using genetic algorithm for gene selection from microarray data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4580821/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10130032","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimization using genetic algorithm for gene selection from microarray data","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"698F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056996S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569830","isNumber":"4580554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569830","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4580554","articleId":"4580821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4580823,"authors":[{"name":"Masrul Faizal Mohamad","affiliation":["Wireless Broadband, Technology Park Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur"],"firstName":"Masrul Faizal","lastName":"Mohamad","id":"37427061000"},{"name":"Mohammed Abdo Saeed","affiliation":["Wireless Broadband, Technology Park Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur"],"firstName":"Mohammed Abdo","lastName":"Saeed","id":"37554929300"},{"name":"Akhmad Unggul Priantoro","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, International Islamic University Malaysia"],"firstName":"Akhmad Unggul","lastName":"Priantoro","id":"37266535200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1691-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1692-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4580823","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Channel estimation","WiMAX","Frequency estimation","Bit error rate","OFDM","Frequency conversion","Mobile communication","System performance","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","frequency division multiple access","interpolation","least squares approximations","mean square error methods","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink channel estimation","channel tracking","Mobile WiMAX Systems","802.16-2005","high-speed, broadband fixed services","mobile services","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","mobile communications","least square methods","interpolation","mean square error","bit error rate","OFDM symbol","Doppler frequencies","OFDMA"]}],"abstract":"Mobile WiMAX is a new promising technology based on IEEE 802.16-2005 that supports high-speed, broadband fixed and mobile services through using orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). In mobile communications, channel estimation is important for system performance, but at the same time it is very crucial when the fading channel is fast time-varying. In this paper, a cluster-based downlink channel estimation and tracking in mobile WiMAX is evaluated based on least square (LS) methods. Interpolation between channel estimates at pilots is carried out both over frequency and time to compensate between high data transfer rate as well as efficient channel estimation. Simulation results in terms of mean square error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER) show that channel estimation over two OFDM symbols exhibits better performance compared to that of single OFDM symbol even at high Doppler frequencies.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580554","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569830/4580554/04580823.pdf","endPage":"1343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink channel estimation and tracking in mobile WiMAX systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580823","startPage":"1340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4580823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Downlink channel estimation and tracking in mobile WiMAX systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580823/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10130034","publicationDate":"May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4580823/","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink channel estimation and tracking in mobile WiMAX systems","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"702F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048185S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569830","isNumber":"4580554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569830","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4580554","articleId":"4580823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4580824,"authors":[{"name":"Wisam F.

It presents a new PAPR reduction method based on addition of power of random signals in a complex Gaussian distribution form to the data constellation points in frequency domain. The added signals alter the constellation shape by shifting the constellation points from their original positions into new positions. This change in shape is accompanied by changes in the statistical properties and reduction in the PAPR value. There is no need to send side information to the receiver for signal recovery. This scheme significantly reduces the PAPR value without decrease in the bit rate or BER performance. Moreover, there is no out-of-band distortion resulted. For 64-PSK OFDM system using 128 data sub-carriers, >4 dB reduction in the PAPR value is achieved by using the proposed PAPR reduction method.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580824","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569830/4580554/04580824.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580554","startPage":"1344","endPage":"1347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Addition of Gaussian random signals for peak to average power ratio reduction in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4580824","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Addition of Gaussian random signals for peak to average power ratio reduction in OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4580824/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10130035","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4580824/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Addition of Gaussian random signals for peak to average power ratio reduction in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"704F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051988S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569830","isNumber":"4580554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569830","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4580554","articleId":"4580824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4580826,"authors":[{"name":"Anil Kumar","affiliation":["Higher Institute of Electronics, Baniwalid, Libya"],"firstName":"Anil","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086084928"},{"name":"E.

It is shown that for the 3D case a simple stackable re-radiating boundary condition (R-RBC) competes with a convolutional perfectly matched layer (CPML). The essence of the R-RBC which based on Field Teleportation technique, is to invoke the principle of equivalent sources using FDTDpsilas discrete definition of the curl to copy any field propagating in one FDTD domain to a finite region of another domain. In this paper we apply this technique of field teleportation to the original 3D domain itself to create a transparent boundary across which any outward traveling FDTD field produces an exact negative copy of itself causing self-canceling. Relatively thin (5 cells) RRBC readily yields absorption of the order of -80 dB in 3D ldquoanechoic chamberrdquo test whereas CPML shows similar performance for a 20-cells layer.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 12th International Conference on Mathematical Methods in Electromagnetic Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569857/4580881/04581007.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"400","publicationTitle":"2008 12th International Conference on Mathematical Methods in Electromagnetic Theory","doi":"10.1109/MMET.2008.4581007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMET.2008.4581007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4580881","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4581007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison between the FDTD convolutional PML and reradiating boundary conditions for simple 3D test problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Three dimensional displays","Teleportation","Boundary conditions","Absorption","Electromagnetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave absorption","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD convolutional PML","reradiating boundary conditions","convolutional perfectly matched layer","field teleportation","anechoic chamber test"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4581007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2008-July 2 2008","displayDocTitle":"A comparison between the FDTD convolutional PML and reradiating boundary conditions for simple 3D test problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4581007/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10130250","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison between the FDTD convolutional PML and reradiating boundary conditions for simple 3D test problem","confLoc":"Odessa, UKraine","sourcePdf":"398_scherbatko.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055212S","chronDate":"June 29 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569857","isNumber":"4580881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569857","xplore-issue":"4580881","articleId":"4581007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4581008,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-Sheng Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guo-Sheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37697472600"},{"name":"Guo-Ji Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, SCUT, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guo-Ji","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538432300"},{"name":"Bin-Jie Hu","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, SCUT, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bin-Jie","lastName":"Hu","id":"37401488200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2284-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-1734"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-1750"}],"articleNumber":"4581008","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":108,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Stability analysis","Dispersion","Accuracy","Artificial neural networks","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-difference time-domain method","alternate direction implicit FDTD","Crank-Nicolson scheme","splitting error","unconditional stability","computational efficiency","electromagnetic problems","Maxwell's systems"]}],"abstract":"Based on the Crank-Nicolson (CN) scheme, an improved alternating direction implicit finite-difference time-domain (ADI-FDTD) method is proposed.

In this method, a high frequency sine wave signal is applied to the field winding and then the magnitude of induced signals on each phase winding is monitored to detect the rotor position at standstill. It then continues to sense the rotor position while the motor is running at low speed by utilizing the same sine wave signal to the field winding but this time the envelope of induced voltages on the un-energized phase windings are measured and compared.

Firstly, two fuzzy logic observers are designed and used to estimate back-EMF space vector components in the stationary reference frame. The inputs of the observers are measured values of line to line voltages and currents, and their outputs are back-EMF space vector components in the stationary reference frame. To determine the commutation instants, a new technique based on the sign of the back-EMF space vector components is proposed. In order to evade the difficulties pertaining to implementation of the fuzzy logic observers, instead of them, two neural network observers are designed which use inputs and output pairs of the fuzzy logic observers as training data. In other words, the fuzzy logic observers is replaced by two neural network ones with the same performance which are easier to implement. This method provides an accurate sensorless operation over wide speed range. The validity of the proposed method is verified through simulations done on a prototype BLDC.","doi":"10.1109/SPEEDHAM.2008.4581091","startPage":"1491","endPage":"1496","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570841/4581062/04581091.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPEEDHAM.2008.4581091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4581062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel sensorless control strategy for BLDC motor drives using a fuzzy logic-based neural network observer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Fuzzy logic","Artificial neural networks","Rotors","Brushless DC motors","Mathematical model","Space stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless DC motors","DC motor drives","fuzzy control","machine vector control","neurocontrollers","observers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensorless control strategy","brushless DC motor drives","fuzzy logic-based neural network observer","back-EMF space vector","BLDC motor drives"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brushless DC","fuzzy logic observer","fuzzy logic-based neural network observer","sensorless"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4581091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A novel sensorless control strategy for BLDC motor drives using a fuzzy logic-based neural network observer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4581091/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140815","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel sensorless control strategy for BLDC motor drives using a fuzzy logic-based neural network observer","confLoc":"Ischia, Italy","sourcePdf":"BD_308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049617S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4570841","isNumber":"4581062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4570841","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4581062","articleId":"4581091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4581128,"authors":[{"name":"Won Seok Oh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuhan-Junior College, South Korea"],"lastName":"Won Seok Oh","id":"37087269516"},{"name":"Kim Sol","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuhan-Junior College, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kim Sol","id":"37087736706"},{"name":"Kyu Min Cho","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications, Yuhan-Junior College, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyu Min Cho","id":"37087269603"},{"name":"Chi Gak In","affiliation":["PEL Korea, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chi Gak In","id":"37087734449"},{"name":"Jae Eul Yeon","affiliation":["Fairchild Korea, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae Eul Yeon","id":"37087269301"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1663-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1664-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4581128","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4581128","abstract":"In this paper, a recurrent artificial neural network (RNN) based self-tuning speed controller is proposed for the high-performance drives of induction motors. The RNN provides a nonlinear modeling of a motor drive system and could provide the controller with information regarding the load variation, system noise, and parameter variation of the induction motor through the online estimated weights of the corresponding RNN. Thus, the proposed self-tuning controller can change the gains of the controller according to system conditions. The gain is composed with the weights of the RNN. For the on-line estimation of the RNN weights, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm is used. A self-tuning controller is designed that is adequate for the speed control of the induction motor.

Air-gap irregularities and related monitoring techniques have been studied in the past mainly about large hydro-generators (with practical applications), but similar problems have been recognized for on-board ship synchronous generators. These latter require a different approach, i.e. non-invasive monitoring. Static and dynamic rotor eccentricities were simulated in this work, for a ship-application sized generator, by using a dynamic model including inductances computed by parametric 3D FEM analysis of the faulty machine. Current, voltage, and no-load e.m.f. steady-state waveforms were analyzed by FFT and space-vector approach. No-load e.m.f. space vector is a sensitive fault indicator since its amplitude largely increases with the level of absolute eccentricity; furthermore, it is possible to discriminate the static eccentricity from the dynamic eccentricity utilizing the space vector loci ovality.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570841/4581062/04581180.pdf","startPage":"1259","endPage":"1264","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion","doi":"10.1109/SPEEDHAM.2008.4581180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPEEDHAM.2008.4581180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4581062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4581180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static and Dynamic Rotor Eccentricity On-Line Detection and Discrimination in Synchronous Generators By No-Load E.M.F.

The basic variables of the discharge process are in fact both voltage and SOC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4581302/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10141023","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4581302/","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved lead -acid battery modelling for photovoltaic application by Recurrent Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved lead -acid battery modelling for photovoltaic application by Recurrent Neural Networks","confLoc":"Ischia, Italy","sourcePdf":"PS3410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069687S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4570841","isNumber":"4581062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4570841","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4581062","articleId":"4581302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4581308,"authors":[{"name":"Mahidhar Nandigam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Mahidhar","lastName":"Nandigam","id":"38096876800"},{"name":"Shirshak K.

The cost and efficiency of offshore wind farms are determined by variety of factors which include the type of electrical system (AC or DC), transmission length, transmission voltage, rated power, wind turbine type and the farm topology, and wind speed. Since the design variable space is large for such problems, computational optimization is necessary to find an optimal solution. We discuss the development of cost, loss and reliability models and the application of geometric program for optimization of the layout and configuration of an offshore wind farm.

The quantum NOT gate is used to realize quantum mutation to avoid premature convergences. The proposed quantum recombination realizes the information communication between subpopulation groups to improve the search efficiency.

How ever, the existing MOPSO designs generally adopt a notion to \"estimate\" a fixed population size sufficiently to explore the search space without incurring excessive computational complexity. To address the issue, this paper proposes the integration of a dynamic population strategy within the multiple-swarm MOPSO. The proposed algorithm is named dynamic population multiple-swarm MOPSO. An additional feature, adaptive local archives, is designed to improve the diversity within each swarm. Performance metrics and benchmark test functions are used to examine the performance of the proposed algorithm compared with that of five selected MOPSOs and two selected multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. In addition, the computational cost of the proposed algorithm is quantified and compared with that of the selected MOPSOs.

The dynamic active display (DAD) is a unique prototype interface that presents safety-critical visual icons to the driver in a manner that minimizes the deviation of his or her gaze direction without adding to unnecessary visual clutter. As part of an automotive safety system, the DAD presents alerts in the field of view of the driver only if necessary, which is based upon the state and pose of the driver, vehicle, and environment. This paper examines the effectiveness of DAD through a comprehensive comparative experimental evaluation of a speed compliance driver assistance system, which is implemented on a vehicular test bed. Three different types of display protocols for assisting a driver to comply with speed limits are tested on actual roadways, and these are compared with a conventional dashboard display. Given the inclination, drivers who are given an overspeed warning alert reduced the time required to slow down to the speed limit by 38% (p < 0.01) as compared with the drivers not given the alert. Additionally, certain alerts decreased distraction levels by reducing the time spent looking away from the road by 63% (p < 0.01). Ultimately, these alerts demonstrate the utility and promise of the DAD system.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.923527","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4749414/04581392.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.923527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Active Heads-Up Display for Driver Assistance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4581392/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Active Heads-Up Display for Driver Assistance","volume":"39","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10391588","pubMedId":"19068432","htmlLink":"/document/4581392/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Active Heads-Up Display for Driver Assistance","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-doshi-923527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151827S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4749414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"4749414","articleId":"4581392","onlineDate":"29 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4581409,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Slowik","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, Koszalin University of Technology, Koszalin, Poland"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Slowik","id":"37266922200"},{"name":"Michal Bialko","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, Koszalin University of Technology, Koszalin, Poland"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Bialko","id":"37448989700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1542-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1543-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-2246"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2254"}],"articleNumber":"4581409","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":887},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4581409","abstract":"In the paper an application of differential evolution algorithm to training of artificial neural networks is presented.

It was proved that PSO algorithm has exhibited good performance across wide range application problems. This paper proposes the use of PSO algorithm for decision making model updating. The decision making model is used to generate one-step forward investment decisions for stock markets. The artificial neural networks (ANN) are used to make the analysis of historical daily stock returns and to calculate one day forward possible profit, which could be get while following the model proposed decisions, concerning the purchase of the stocks. Subsequently the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied in order to select the ldquoglobal bestrdquo ANNs for the future investment decisions and to adapt the weights of other networks towards the weights of the best network. Different from our previous works this paper presents a new variant of PSO algorithm where the clusters of particle are identified in the search space. Knowing clusters the centers of clusters are substitutes for the best particle. Also this paper introduces variation of regular PSO algorithm where decision and particle training is made based on the performance of worst particle. Experimental investigations have shown that average performance per a fixed number of iterations can be improved by substituting cluster centers for the individualpsilas best positions. Also experimental investigation on decision making using worst particle shows that better results than using regular PSO can be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/HSI.2008.4581414","startPage":"88","endPage":"93","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Conference on Human System Interactions","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569859/4581395/04581414.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Conference on Human System Interactions","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HSI.2008.4581414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4581395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of particle swarm optimization algorithm to decision making model incorporating cluster analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision making","Artificial neural networks","Algorithm design and analysis","Clustering algorithms","Particle swarm optimization","Training","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","investment","neural nets","particle swarm optimisation","pattern clustering","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","cluster analysis","decision making model updating","one-step forward investment decisions","stock markets","artificial neural networks","global best ANN","particle training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Networks","Clustering","Decision Making Model","Particle Swarm Optimization","Stock Markets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4581414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Application of particle swarm optimization algorithm to decision making model incorporating cluster analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4581414/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10130325","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of particle swarm optimization algorithm to decision making model incorporating cluster analysis","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"0088_KF-000159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047892S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569859","isNumber":"4581395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569859","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4581395","articleId":"4581414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4581472,"authors":[{"name":"Limin Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Embedded Systems, IT School, Huzhou University, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Limin Liu","id":"37423387600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1542-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1543-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-2246"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2254"}],"articleNumber":"4581472","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Process control","Intelligent control","Mathematical model","Feeds","Artificial intelligence","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ball milling","coal","control system synthesis","fuzzy control","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","process control","pulverised fuels","thermal power stations","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent fuzzy control design","nonlinear MIMO system","uncertain mathematic algorithm","ball mill industrial process","coal pulverization","coal-fired power plant","process control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["non-linear systems","intelligent control","fuzzy systems","MIMO systems"]}],"abstract":"Intelligent control is more available for some MIMO systems, especially for some processes with uncertain mathematic algorithm.

First, a strong network sensitivity to small changes in the network weights as a result of multiple, nonlinear connections between its variables. Second, a poor quality of the network mapping resulting from the finiteness of the learning set describing unique properties of that system. To overcome these constraints, a few modifications of the basic learning procedure have been proposed.

Because in user identification the processing time is an important issue, we use only the hand boundary as a hand representation. Using this representation, an alignment technique is used to make the index of corresponding features of different hands get the same index in the feature vector. To improve the classification performance a new ensemble-based method is proposed. This method uses feature transformation to create the needed diversity between base classifiers. In other words, first different sets of features are created by transforming the original features into new spaces where the samples are well separated, and then each base classifier is trained on one of these newly created features sets. The proposed method for constructing an ensemble of classifiers is a general method which may be used in any classification problem. The results of experiments performed to assess the presented method and compare its performance with other alternative classification methods are encouraging.","doi":"10.1109/HSI.2008.4581535","startPage":"749","endPage":"754","publicationTitle":"2008 Conference on Human System Interactions","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HSI.2008.4581535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4581395","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Conference on Human System Interactions","pdfPath":"/iel5/4569859/4581395/04581535.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new ensemble based classifier using feature transformation for hand recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4581535/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new ensemble based classifier using feature transformation for hand recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4581535/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10130444","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new ensemble based classifier using feature transformation for hand recognition","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"0749_KF-002003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061237S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4569859","isNumber":"4581395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4569859","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4581395","articleId":"4581535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4581548,"authors":[{"name":"W.

This technique features handling of many microfluidic operations simultaneously and uses on-chip sensors for diagnosis at run-time. Once a fault is detected during the droplet routing, recovery procedures will be started-up immediately. Faulty units on the chip will be marked and isolated from the array so that the remaining droplets can still be routed along a fault-free path to their destinations.

We use hydrogels to trap and release cells for incubation. The porous nature of these gels allows the transport of nutrient and waste, and the gel network can also present specific adhesive properties for attachment of cells. Channel design and flowrate control are crucial in determining hydrogel geometry, while on-chip temperature control triggers reversible gel formation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 14th International Mixed-Signals, Sensors, and Systems Test Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570838/4581591/04581623.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 14th International Mixed-Signals, Sensors, and Systems Test Workshop","doi":"10.1109/IMS3TW.2008.4581623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMS3TW.2008.4581623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4581591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4581623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated microfluidic systems for cell culture and characterization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heating","Electrodes","Microfluidics","Fluids","Plasma temperature","Temperature measurement","Plastics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adhesion","bioMEMS","cellular transport","gels","lab-on-a-chip","microchannel flow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated microfluidic systems","cell culture","lab-on-a-chip system","temperature control","electrokinetic cell handling","hydrogels","incubation","nutrient transport","waste transport","flowrate control","channel design","adhesive properties"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4581623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Integrated microfluidic systems for cell culture and characterization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4581623/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140677","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated microfluidic systems for cell culture and characterization","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"Integratedmicrofluidicsystemsforcellculture.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084365S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4570838","isNumber":"4581591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4570838","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4581591","articleId":"4581623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4581624,"authors":[{"name":"Bonnie L.

To target automotive or aeronautic applications, Flash memory manufacturers have to consider specific methods and design solutions to improve reliability. Among recent reliability enhancement techniques, ECC are probably the most efficient. However, ECC techniques are limited to correct errors occurring punctually within a word whereas in Flash memory, the presence of high voltage potential can stress peripheral circuits. This stress can lead to an entire faulty bit line or word line (clustering effect). The bit line clustering effect can be corrected by ECC because this effect impacts one or more bits in a word. But ECC remains unable to correct an entire faulty word line caused for instance by a catastrophic defect in a word line (WL) driver. This work proposes an electrical signature analysis of a WL driver output when catastrophic defects related to reliability problems are injected in such circuit. Then, based on these faulty electrical signatures, a solution for on-line diagnosis and repair of defective WL drivers is proposed. Finally, this solution is shown as low cost in term of surface overhead because only 16 high voltage transistors and 38 low voltage transistors are used for each word line. In addition to ECC techniques, the proposed solution could be used by the memory manufacturers to address automotive applications.","doi":"10.1109/IMS3TW.2008.4581627","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 14th International Mixed-Signals, Sensors, and Systems Test Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 14th International Mixed-Signals, Sensors, and Systems Test Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570838/4581591/04581627.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4581591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMS3TW.2008.4581627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4581627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability issues in flash memories: An on-line diagnosis and repair scheme for word line drivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4581627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reliability issues in flash memories: An on-line diagnosis and repair scheme for word line drivers","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10140681","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4581627/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability issues in flash memories: An on-line diagnosis and repair scheme for word line drivers","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ReliabilityIssuesinFlashMemories.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051254S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4570838","isNumber":"4581591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4570838","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4581591","articleId":"4581627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4581648,"authors":[{"name":"Fangwen Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Fangwen Fu (S'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.

Our main focus is on developing solutions for wireless users to successfully compete with each other for the limited and time-varying spectrum opportunities, given experienced dynamics in the wireless network. To analyze the interactions among users given the environment disturbance, we propose a stochastic game framework for modeling how the competition among users for spectrum opportunities evolves over time. At each stage of the stochastic game, a central spectrum moderator (CSM) auctions the available resources, and the users strategically bid for the required resources. The joint bid actions affect the resource allocation and, hence, the rewards and future strategies of all users. Based on the observed resource allocations and corresponding rewards, we propose a best-response learning algorithm that can be deployed by wireless users to improve their bidding policy at each stage. The simulation results show that by deploying the proposed best-response learning algorithm, the wireless users can significantly improve their own bidding strategies and, hence, their performance in terms of both the application quality and the incurred cost for the used resources.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Compete for Resources in Wireless Stochastic Games","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2002917","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4897220/04581648.pdf","startPage":"1904","endPage":"1919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2002917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897220","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4581648","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4581648/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Compete for Resources in Wireless Stochastic Games","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4581648/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601616","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Compete for Resources in Wireless Stochastic Games","sourcePdf":"tvt-fu-2002917.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.175162S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4897220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4897220","articleId":"4581648","onlineDate":"29 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4581649,"authors":[{"name":"Saleh Yousefi","affiliation":["Computer Department, Engineering, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4665392/4581649/4581649-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saleh Yousefi received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer engineering (in the hardware field) and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering (in the networking field) from Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1999, 2002, and 2008, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Computer Department, Faculty of Engineering, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran.

We use a common model in vehicular traffic theory in which a fixed point on the highway sees cars passing it that are separated by times with an exponentially distributed duration. We obtain the distribution of the distances between the cars, which allows us to use techniques from queuing theory to study connectivity. We obtain the Laplace transform of the probability distribution of the connectivity distance, explicit expressions for the expected connectivity distance, and the probability distribution and expectation of the number of cars in a platoon. Then, we conduct extensive simulation studies to evaluate the obtained results. The analytical model that we present is able to describe the effects of various system parameters, including road traffic parameters (i.e., speed distribution and traffic flow) and the transmission range of vehicles, on the connectivity. To more precisely study the effect of speed on connectivity, we provide bounds obtained using stochastic ordering techniques. Our approach is based on the work of Miorandi and Altman, which transformed the problem of connectivity distance distribution into that of the distribution of the busy period of an equivalent infinite server queue. We use our analytical results, along with common road traffic statistical data, to understand connectivity in vehicular ad hoc networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4581649/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2008","volume":"57","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10312129","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4581649/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Model for Connectivity in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Model for Connectivity in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"57tvt06-altman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080613S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4665392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"227","xplore-issue":"4665392","articleId":"4581649","onlineDate":"29 July 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4582341,"authors":[{"name":"Hongwei Qu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oakland University, Rochester, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/4582339/4582341/4582341-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongwei Qu (S'03\u2013M'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 1988 and 1993, respectively, the M.S. degree in physics from Florida International University, Miami, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, in 2006.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oakland University, Rochester, MI.

An improved DRIE post-CMOS MEMS process has been developed, which provides robust single-crystal silicon (SCS) structures in all three axes and greatly reduces undercut of comb fingers. The sensing electrodes are also composed of the thick SCS layer, resulting in high resolution and large sensing capacitance. Due to the high wiring flexibility provided by the fabrication process, fully differential capacitive sensing and common-centroid configurations are realized in all three axes. A low-noise, low- power dual-chopper amplifier is designed for each axis, which consumes only 1 mW power. With 44.5 dB on-chip amplification, the measured sensitivities of x-, y-, and z-axis accelerometers are 520 mV/g, 460 mV/g, and 320 mV/g, respectively, which can be tuned by simply changing the amplitude of the modulation signal. Accordingly, the overall noise floors of the x-, y-, and z-axis are 12 mug/radicHz , 14 mug/radicHz, and 110 mug/radicHz, respectively, when tested at around 200 Hz.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2008.923582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2008.923582","startPage":"1511","endPage":"1518","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/4582339/04582341.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4582339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Monolithic CMOS-MEMS 3-Axis Accelerometer With a Low-Noise, Low-Power Dual-Chopper Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Monolithic CMOS-MEMS 3-Axis Accelerometer With a Low-Noise, Low-Power Dual-Chopper Amplifier","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","volume":"8","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4582341/","accessionNumber":"10116967","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4582341/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Monolithic CMOS-MEMS 3-Axis Accelerometer With a Low-Noise, Low-Power Dual-Chopper Amplifier","sourcePdf":"08jsen09-qu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069231S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"4582339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"4582339","articleId":"4582341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4582398,"authors":[{"name":"Miltiadis Vasileiadis","affiliation":["Department of Material Science, University of Patras, Rio-Patras, Greece","Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"bio":{"p":["Miltiadis Vasileiadis received the B.Sc. degree in physics and the M.Sc. degree in microelectronics from the University of Athens, Athens, Greece, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

The controller is derived using model-based design techniques. Two separate control plant models are employed: a 3-degree-of-freedom (DOF) current-induced vessel model accounting for the current loads acting on the vehicle and a 5-DOF model describing the vehicle dynamics. The main design objective behind this strategy is to incorporate the vehicle dynamics when estimating the current influence on the vehicle. Furthermore, the transit model is based on the notion of constant propeller revolution resulting in a partly linearized model, which subsequently leads to perspicuous and implementable controller and observer structures. The controller is derived using the observer backstepping technique, and the closed loop is proved to be asymptotically stable using Lyapunov and cascaded systems theory. The control objective is to track the desired pitch and heading angle generated by the line-of-sight guidance system while keeping constant forward thrust. Experimental results demonstrate successful performance of the proposed output feedback controller implemented on the Minesniper MkII AUV/ROV. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2007.916347","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/4582404/04582414.pdf","startPage":"930","endPage":"946","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2007.916347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4582404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Based Output Feedback Control of Slender-Body Underactuated AUVs: Theory and Experiments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4582414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Model-Based Output Feedback Control of Slender-Body Underactuated AUVs: Theory and Experiments","volume":"16","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10118395","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4582414/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Based Output Feedback Control of Slender-Body Underactuated AUVs: Theory and Experiments","sourcePdf":"16tcst05-refsnes.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147216S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"4582404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"4582404","articleId":"4582414","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4582433,"authors":[{"name":"Grain P.

Almost all DC-DC controllers can be adapted as the control core, whereas the feedback signal processor can be implemented by either voltage compensator and/or current compensator. The controller's implementation is simple and flexible with logic and analog circuitry. Yet, it demonstrates experimentally excellent load handling, source voltage noise rejection, and reference tracking ability. The prototype is tested under resistive load, highly nonlinear load, and extreme load transients; aside from that, it is also tested under noisy source voltage and sudden reference change. In all cases, the prototype demonstrated high-quality output voltages.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.924207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4582432/04582452.pdf","startPage":"2894","endPage":"2902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.924207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4582432","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4582452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Analog Controller for Three-Phase Voltage Generation Inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Analog Controller for Three-Phase Voltage Generation Inverter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4582452/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","volume":"55","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4582452/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10118349","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Analog Controller for Three-Phase Voltage Generation Inverter","sourcePdf":"55tie08-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075208S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4582432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4582432","articleId":"4582452","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4582469,"authors":[{"name":"Tien-I Liu","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computer Science, California State University, Sacramento, Sacramento, California, USA"],"lastName":"Tien-I Liu","id":"37087605843"},{"name":"Junyi Lee","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computer Science, California State University, Sacramento, Sacramento, California, USA"],"lastName":"Junyi Lee","id":"37087604430"},{"name":"Gurinder Singh Gill","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computer Science, California State University, Sacramento, Sacramento, California, USA"],"lastName":"Gurinder Singh Gill","id":"37087796381"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1717-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1718-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"4582469","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4582469","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised monitoring","cutting","fuzzy neural nets","inference mechanisms","production engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online monitoring","online diagnosis","tapping process conditions","tapping torque","thrust force","lateral forces","sequential forward search algorithm","adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems"]}],"abstract":"Tapping has been widely used throughout industry, and its proper operation is paramount in ensuring product quality.

MIMO systems employ multiple transmit and multiple receive antennas, combined with the opportunities opened by large vehicle surfaces on which multielement antennas can be placed, makes MIMO techniques very attractive for vehicle-to-vehicle communications. In this paper, we propose an original street model for MIMO vehicle-to-vehicle fading channels, derived from this model, the analysis of statistical properties of transmit and the receive correlation functions is given, and some numerical results for the special case of isotropic scattering are presented.

The controller design for the system will be complex. In this paper, we propose two-neural-network controller (TNNC) to learn the unknown nonlinear coefficient of control systems. For the convenience of control, the structure of the two-neural-network is divided into two parts. Each part is a neural-network. Beginning, two neural-networks have the same structure. In the actual control process, one neural-networkpsilas output is used to approximate the output of controller, and the other neural-network is learning, the learning is the main on-line tracking learning. In control processing, the actions of two neural-networks can be exchanged by using the switching line, which can be gotten from Lyapunov energy function of the nonlinear system. Different with other neural network algorithms, here, the process of implement and learning of TNNC is divided, i.e., the learning of TNNC is fulfilled by one neural network, and the implement of TNNC is accomplished by another neural network. This does not make the learning to affect the real control. Stability analysis of this control law is also given in the paper.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582566","startPage":"500","endPage":"504","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570851/4582468/04582566.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4582468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partially unknown nonlinear systems identification based on two-neural-network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partially unknown nonlinear systems identification","tracking error","two-neural-network controller","on-line tracking learning","Lyapunov energy function","stability analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4582566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Partially unknown nonlinear systems identification based on two-neural-network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4582566/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153210","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partially unknown nonlinear systems identification based on two-neural-network","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"pg0500-504_conf130a171-r139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4570851","isNumber":"4582468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4570851","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4582468","articleId":"4582566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4582568,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangjiang Wang","affiliation":["School of Energy and Power Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Jiangjiang Wang","id":"37087577105"},{"name":"Youyin Jing","affiliation":["School of Energy and Power Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Youyin Jing","id":"37087428390"},{"name":"Chunfa Zhang","affiliation":["School of Energy and Power Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Chunfa Zhang","id":"37087643313"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1717-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1718-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"4582568","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","genetic algorithms","heat exchangers","matrix decomposition","multivariable control systems","space heating","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic optimization algorithm","variable flow heating system","homes","apartments","energy saving","heat exchanger","multivariable PID decoupling controller","diagonally matrix method-based decomposition compensatory unit","improved genetic algorithm","floating point representation","micromutation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decoupling control","Genetic algorithm","Optimization","PID control","Variable flow heating system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4582568","abstract":"Heating systems are used in homes and apartments worldwide.

This controller consists of diagonally matrix method-based decomposition compensatory unit and PID controller. To obtain better performance in the control system, an improved genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize the PID parameters in floating point representations. The population mutates before crossover in the computing process of the improved genetic algorithm, which is benefit to the convergence. To solve the slow convergence during the later evolution, the micro mutation algorithm is adopted. The simulation results show that the decoupling control system is effective and feasible.

Moreover, through regulating the terminal voltage of motor, the system made the rising ratio and dropping ratio of the phase currents be approximate so as to keep the amplitude of the total current in the constant. To further suppress the torque ripple, neural network (NN) control algorithm was researched and applied to the system. The controller comprises a back propagation (BP) NN and a radial basis function (RBF) NN. The former is used to adaptively adjust the parameters of the PID controller on-line. The later is used to establish nonlinear prediction model and perform parameter prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed method in this paper could ensure prominent reduction of torque ripple, have good robustness, and achieve position-sensorless commutation control of BLDCM successfully.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582616","startPage":"752","endPage":"757","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570851/4582468/04582616.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4582468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Torque ripple control of position-sensorless brushless DC motor based on neural network identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Commutation","Torque measurement","Artificial neural networks","Mathematical model","Batteries","Equivalent circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless DC motors","machine control","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","radial basis function networks","three-term control","torque control","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["torque ripple control","position-sensorless brushless DC motor","neural network identification","detection circuit","battery cathode","phase-shifting compensation","neural network control algorithm","back propagation neural network","radial basis function neural network","PID controller"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4582616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Torque ripple control of position-sensorless brushless DC motor based on neural network identification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4582616/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153317","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Torque ripple control of position-sensorless brushless DC motor based on neural network identification","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"pg0752-757_conf130a483-r339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055951S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4570851","isNumber":"4582468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4570851","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4582468","articleId":"4582616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4582618,"authors":[{"name":"Ahad Kazemi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ahad","lastName":"Kazemi","id":"37268076100"},{"name":"Saeed Jalilzadeh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Zanjan University, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Jalilzadeh","id":"37567623500"},{"name":"Meisam Mahdavi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Zanjan University, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Meisam","lastName":"Mahdavi","id":"37682850800"},{"name":"Hosein Haddadian","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Zanjan University, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Hosein","lastName":"Haddadian","id":"38094075500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1717-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1718-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"4582618","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4582618","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","losses","power transmission planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","load growth factor effect","network loss","TNEP","transmission network expansion planning","Garvers six-bus network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582618","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570851/4582468/04582618.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","startPage":"764","endPage":"769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4582468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm-based investigation of load growth factor effect on the network loss in TNEP","abstract":"Transmission network expansion planning (TNEP) is a basic part of power network expansion planning. Up to now, various papers have been presented on the field of static transmission network expansion planning (STNEP). But, in all of them, the effect of load growth on the network loss in transmission networks with different voltage levels has not been investigated. Therefore, in this paper, STNEP has been studied considering the effect of load growth factor on the network loss in a transmission network with two different voltage levels using genetic algorithm (GA). Finally the proposed idea is examined on Garverpsilas six-bus network. The results show that the load growth factor has important effect on the network loss rate and subsequent type of the network arrangement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4582618/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10153319","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4582618/","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm-based investigation of load growth factor effect on the network loss in TNEP","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm-based investigation of load growth factor effect on the network loss in TNEP","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"pg0764-769_conf130a285-r224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073383S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4570851","isNumber":"4582468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4570851","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4582468","articleId":"4582618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4582619,"authors":[{"name":"Shang Wanfeng","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Shang Wanfeng","id":"37087818186"},{"name":"Zhao Shengdun","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Zhao Shengdun","id":"37087815216"},{"name":"Shen Yajing","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Shen Yajing","id":"37087818595"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1717-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1718-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"4582619","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4582619","abstract":"A hybrid method, a flexible tolerance genetic algorithm (FTAGA), is applied in this paper to solve a complicated engineering problem concerning synthesis optimization of a double-crank mechanism.

The idea behind this is to present an architecture that tries to approach this target. In this paper, a new training algorithm that utilizes a feedback mechanism to iteratively improve the classification capability of the ensemble is presented. This algorithm is called combination weights adaptive modulating (CWAM) algorithm. By CWAM, all the individual networks in the ensemble are trained simultaneously and interactively through the evolving combination weights. To evaluate the performance of CWAM, five well-known classification problems were used. Experimental studies have been carried out to show that the generalization ability of CWAM is much better than that of other neural network ensembles in almost all cases.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582622","startPage":"785","endPage":"789","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4582468","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570851/4582468/04582622.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Ensemble with Combination Weights Adaptive Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4582622/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Ensemble with Combination Weights Adaptive Modulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4582622/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10153323","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Ensemble with Combination Weights Adaptive Modulation","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"pg0785-789_conf130a853-r317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053804S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4570851","isNumber":"4582468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4570851","xplore-issue":"4582468","articleId":"4582622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4582626,"authors":[{"name":"Fangrui Liu","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Fangrui Liu","id":"37087791099"},{"name":"Yong Kang","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Yong Kang","id":"37087142770"},{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Yu Zhang","id":"37087275279"},{"name":"Shanxu Duan","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Shanxu Duan","id":"37087199867"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1717-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1718-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"4582626","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4656},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of P&O and hill climbing MPPT methods for grid-connected PV converter","abstract":"Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques are employed in photovoltaic (PV) systems to make full utilization of the PV array output power which depends on solar irradiation and ambient temperature.

Our theoretic analysis is confirmed by numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582636","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570851/4582468/04582636.pdf","startPage":"853","endPage":"856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4582468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel LOFDM signal and its optimization over doubly-dispersion channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4582636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4582636/","displayDocTitle":"A novel LOFDM signal and its optimization over doubly-dispersion channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153356","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4582636/","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel LOFDM signal and its optimization over doubly-dispersion channels","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"pg0853-856_conf130a433-r334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052747S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4570851","isNumber":"4582468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4570851","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4582468","articleId":"4582636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4582670,"authors":[{"name":"Yushi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Yushi Chen","id":"37087583612"},{"name":"Aili Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Aili Wang","id":"37087597212"},{"name":"Ye Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Ye Zhang","id":"37087181093"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1717-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1718-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"4582670","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","genetic algorithms","geophysical signal processing","image coding","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm based reference bands selection","hyperspectral image compression","prediction residual"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4582670","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an algorithm for reference bands selection in HyperSpectral Image (HSI) compression.

Since the straight-line motion is a fundamental motion of CNC machine and robot, this paper introduces a linear interpolation method to do approximate straight-line motion within any 3-axis space. As Interpolation calculation of hardware interpolation is implemented by hardware logic circuit such as ASIC or FPGA in the controller, therefore this method can avoid a large amount of complex mathematical calculation, which hints that this controller has high real-time performance. The simulation of straight-line motion within 3D space verifies the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of 3-axis linear interpolation in a FPGA-based 4-axis motion controller","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582729","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570851/4582468/04582729.pdf","startPage":"1308","endPage":"1313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4582468","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4582729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4582729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of 3-axis linear interpolation in a FPGA-based 4-axis motion controller","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4582729/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153507","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of 3-axis linear interpolation in a FPGA-based 4-axis motion controller","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"pg1308-1313_conf130a1079-r811.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073516S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4570851","isNumber":"4582468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4570851","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4582468","articleId":"4582729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4582736,"authors":[{"name":"Jingjun Zhang","affiliation":["Scientific Research Office Hebei University of Engineering, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Jingjun Zhang","id":"37311578500"},{"name":"Kanghua Lou","affiliation":["Scientific Research Office Hebei University of Engineering, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Kanghua Lou","id":"37721548300"},{"name":"Ruizhen Gao","affiliation":["Scientific Research Office Hebei University of Engineering, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Ruizhen Gao","id":"37306703900"},{"name":"Guanyuan liu","affiliation":["Scientific Research Office Hebei University of Engineering, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Guanyuan liu","id":"38091089200"},{"name":"Yang sun","affiliation":["Scientific Research Office Hebei University of Engineering, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Yang sun","id":"37536861000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1717-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1718-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"4582736","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive components","design engineering","genetic algorithms","road vehicles","suspensions (mechanical components)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coarse-grained genetic algorithm","optimal design","flexible multibody model vehicle suspensions","cluster system","sequential genetic algorithms","master-slave module"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4582736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4582468","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570851/4582468/04582736.pdf","startPage":"1343","endPage":"1347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of coarse-grained genetic algorithm for the optimal design of the flexible multi-body model vehicle suspensions","abstract":"A parallel genetic algorithm based coarse-grained module for the optimal design of the flexible multi-body model vehicle suspensions is presented, this paper tests the algorithm on the cluster system based MPI.

The SCF is an alternative tool to mitigate harmonic distortion in the AC supply system as it has only small capacitor size and low switching frequency. Harmonic detection by using neural network technique is developed to determine harmonic component and hysteresis control is used to generate compensated current. The digital signal processor (DSP) is used to implement digital based control. Simulation and experimental work is carried out to evaluate its control performance.

In general wireless communication system, it was apparent that even for one source there are many possible propagation paths and angles of arrival.

Therefore, it is important for a received array to be able to estimate the angles of arrival in order to decipher which emitters are present and what are their possible angular locations. This information can be used to eliminate or combine signals for greater fidelity, suppress interferers, or both.

In this paper, we develop a novel network tomography approach using recurrent neural network (RNN) that track origin-destination traffic matrix based on partial measurements without any prior information. Our RNN approach not only allows us to estimate traffic matrix and can also be used to predict traffic. Using real data collected from a Ailebant network, we illustrate that our proposed approach can achieve lower errors than general Gravity model prior.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582797","startPage":"1640","endPage":"1643","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570851/4582468/04582797.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4582468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Recurrent Neural Network approach to traffic matrix tracking using partial measurements","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural network","traffic matrix tracking","partial measurements","routing","configuration debugging","monitoring","inference traffic matrix","network tomography technology","Ailebant network","Gravity model prior"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4582797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Recurrent Neural Network approach to traffic matrix tracking using partial measurements","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4582797/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153118","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Recurrent Neural Network approach to traffic matrix tracking using partial measurements","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"pg1640-1643_conf130a620-r394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054171S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4570851","isNumber":"4582468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4570851","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4582468","articleId":"4582797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4582816,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-zi Li","affiliation":["College of Information and Electrical Engineering, Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture, XiCheng District, Beijing, P.R.

It is shown that the standard row-column decoding algorithm in the literature is essentially the same as the serial check-updating schedule. By viewing the code graph from a different perspective, we propose a serial bit-updating schedule that uses the MacLaurin Series expansion to approximate the computationally intensive check operation. The proposed algorithm converges faster than the parallel decoding schedule and can be implemented efficiently in hardware by using high-speed adders, comparators, and shift registers.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","graph theory","magnetic recording","message passing","parity check codes","product codes","scheduling","series (mathematics)","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TPCSPC decoding","coded partial-response channels","turbo product codes","single-parity-check component codes","low-complexity coding scheme","magnetic recording systems","LDPC codes","message-passing schedules","sum-product algorithm","row-column decoding algorithm","serial check-updating schedule","code graph","serial bit-updating schedule","MacLaurin series expansion","parallel decoding schedule","high-speed adders","comparators","shift registers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Single-parity-check (SPC) code","sum-product algorithm (SPA)","turbo product codes (TPC)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4582841","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582841","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570851/4582468/04582841.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582841","startPage":"1853","endPage":"1857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4582468","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TPCSPC decoding over coded partial-response channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"TPCSPC decoding over coded partial-response channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4582841/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4582841/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153200","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TPCSPC decoding over coded partial-response channels","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"pg1853-1857_conf130a350-r121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041279S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4570851","isNumber":"4582468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4570851","xplore-issue":"4582468","articleId":"4582841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4582842,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiliang Qin","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, Singapore"],"lastName":"Zhiliang Qin","id":"37087156618"},{"name":"Xiaoxin Zou","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, Singapore"],"lastName":"Xiaoxin Zou","id":"37087154617"},{"name":"Kui Cai","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, Singapore"],"lastName":"Kui Cai","id":"37087156069"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1717-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1718-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"4582842","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"abstract":"The conventional multiuser detector based on the a posteriori probability (APP) algorithm has a computational complexity growing exponentially with the number of users.

It is shown that the proposed receiver can significantly reduce the computational complexity with only slight performance degradation compared to the full-complexity APP multiuser detector.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","computational complexity","convolutional codes","multiuser detection","search problems","simulated annealing","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing","turbo multiuser detection","a posteriori probability algorithm","computational complexity","heuristic search method","large-scale combinatorial optimization problems","correlated convolutional code","turbo coded channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["List decoding","multiuser detection","simulated annealing","soft-input/soft-output"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582842","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570851/4582468/04582842.pdf","startPage":"1858","endPage":"1863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4582468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo multiuser detection based on simulated annealing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4582842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Turbo multiuser detection based on simulated annealing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4582842/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4582842/","accessionNumber":"10153201","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo multiuser detection based on simulated annealing","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"pg1858-1863_conf130a349-r121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076184S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4570851","isNumber":"4582468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4570851","xplore-issue":"4582468","articleId":"4582842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4582843,"authors":[{"name":"N.

A kind of general-purposed decoupling and control algorithm for time-variant MIMO system with strong coupling is proposed in this paper. Model reference adaptive control (MRAC) and decouple control are combined together in the proposed control algorithm. Using the arbitrary non-linear approximation ability of RBF neural network, RBF neural network controller (RBF-NNC) is designed. The linking weights between hidden layer and output layer are modified with gradient descent algorithm. Patter concept and its related learning mechanism in neural network off-line learning is introduced into online self-learning algorithm for RBF neural network and 2 learning methods based on pattern concept are presented. RBF neural network identifier (RBF-NNI) is introduced to acquire the controlled object related information in the online self-learning process of RBF-NNC. Online optimization algorithm for self-learning rate in the modification of linking weights in RBF-NNC and RBF-NNI and implementation process for the complete control algorithm is given. Simulation experiments for the deaerator MIMO system are performed. Comparison of simulation results from the proposed control algorithm with that from other 2 widely used algorithms shows that desirable effects in decouple and control are achieved and much better with the proposed control algorithm. Meantime, relatively good real-time performance is achieved as well.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582856","pdfPath":"/iel5/4570851/4582468/04582856.pdf","startPage":"1929","endPage":"1934","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4582468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A class of model reference adaptive decouple control based on RBF neural network in deaerator system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4582856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A class of model reference adaptive decouple control based on RBF neural network in deaerator system","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10153233","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4582856/","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A class of model reference adaptive decouple control based on RBF neural network in deaerator system","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"pg1929-1934_conf130a876-r89.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057264S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4570851","isNumber":"4582468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4570851","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4582468","articleId":"4582856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4582878,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The optimization is carried out on the autocorrelation of the array weight instead on the array weight as the conventional beamformers. This kind of adaptive beamformer is able to flexibly control the robust region with a specific ripple. In practice, adaptive beamformers suffer from not only steering direction error, but also many other imperfections. In order to make an adaptive beamformer robust against all kinds of array imperfections, in this paper, we propose a new beamformer based on worst-case optimization. The resultant design possesses superior robustness against arbitrary array imperfections.

Unlike previous approaches, it can be used either for urban or highway scenarios since it is not based on a specific visual traffic feature extraction but on 3D raw data points. The whole process is performed in the Euclidean space and consists of two stages. Initially, a compact 2D representation of the original 3D data points is computed. Then, a RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) based least-squares approach is used to fit a plane to the road. Fast RANSAC fitting is obtained by selecting points according to a probability function that takes into account the density of points at a given depth. Finally, stereo camera height and pitch angle are computed related to the fitted road plane. The proposed technique is intended to be used in driver-assistance systems for applications such as vehicle or pedestrian detection. Experimental results on urban environments, which are the most challenging scenarios (i.e., flat/uphill/downhill driving, speed bumps, and car's accelerations), are presented. These results are validated with manually annotated ground truth.

Lack of flexible analog devices, counterparts to digital Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), prevents analog designers from the benefits of rapid prototyping. This forces them to expensive and lengthy custom design, fabrication, and qualification of application specific integrated circuits (ASIC). The limitations come from two directions: first, commercial Field Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAA) have very limited variability in the building block components offered on-chip (practically only one type of operational amplifiers/ comparator per chip); and second, these are only qualified for best case scenarios for military grade (-55degC to +125degC). However, the analog circuitry required for sensing and control impose a larger component variability. Moreover, in order to avoid large overheads in mass, energy and wiring, there is a growing trend towards avoiding thermal and radiation protection by developing extreme environment electronics, i.e. electronics that maintain correct operation while directly exposed to temperature extremes e.g., on Moon (-180degC to +125degC). This paper describes a recent FPAA design, the Self-Reconfigurable Analog Array (SRAA) that was developed at JPL. It overcomes both limitations: a larger variety of analog building block components in the cells of the array and the possibility to operate over a wide range by compensating deviations due to temperature using a built in general purpose genetic algorithm (GA) engine as an IP core.","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2008.68","publicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584238/4584239/04584259.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2008.68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Reconfigurable Analog Array Integrated Circuit Architecture for Space Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584259/","displayDocTitle":"Self-Reconfigurable Analog Array Integrated Circuit Architecture for Space Applications","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584259/","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153825","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Reconfigurable Analog Array Integrated Circuit Architecture for Space Applications","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"3166a083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080727S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584238","isNumber":"4584239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584238","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4584239","articleId":"4584259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4584260,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Kyu Jung","affiliation":["Texas A and M University, College Station, USA"],"firstName":"Yong-Kyu","lastName":"Jung","id":"37289090500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3166-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4584260","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-FPGA-based Field-programmable Self-repairable (FPSR) Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584238/4584239/04584260.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"100","publicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2008.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584239","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2008.29","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Table lookup","Microarchitecture","Delay","Hardware","Computer architecture","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonFPGA-based field-programmable self-repairable microarchitecture","fault-defect tolerance","architecture-level fault-defect recovery","field-programmable self-repair","reconfigurable devices","ASIC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["non-FPGA-based adaptable microarchitecture","field-programmable self-repair","post-fabrication defect-prevention"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584260","abstract":"A non-FPGA-based adaptable microarchitecture is presented for fault/defect-tolerance.

This FPSR scheme that dynamically cures delay/permanent faults and soft-errors detected at circuit- and architecture-level, respectively, is demonstrated as a means to overcome the limitations of circuit-level fault/defect tolerance. The FPSR adaptable architecture was developed without employing reconfigurable devices (e.g., FPGAs). This architecture is adaptable enough to fix errors by reasserting different patterns and delays of the recovering signals via rerouted alternative resources/paths for the same operation without causing the same faults again. In order to dynamically respond to FPSR operations with less redundancy, the adaptable microarchitecture generates and delivers alternative sequences of repair signal patterns via its adaptable architecture; these can be implemented in ASIC, while continuously and seamlessly supporting post-fabrication defect-prevention in both hardware and software at system levels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584260/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153826","htmlLink":"/document/4584260/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Non-FPGA-based Field-programmable Self-repairable (FPSR) Microarchitecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-FPGA-based Field-programmable Self-repairable (FPSR) Microarchitecture","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"3166a093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069788S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584238","isNumber":"4584239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584238","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4584239","articleId":"4584260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4584264,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenhua Cai","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhenhua","lastName":"Cai","id":"38083034900"},{"name":"Sanyou Zeng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Sanyou","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37604847300"},{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37677350100"},{"name":"Lishan Kang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Lishan","lastName":"Kang","id":"37275755600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3166-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4584264","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584264","abstract":"A group of NASA had designed an evolved X-band antenna for NASApsilas Space Technology 5 (ST5) spacecraft in 2003 which then became the first evolved hardware in space. However they didn't consider too much about the efficiency of algorithm. In this paper we focus more on the algorithm. Firstly we borrow the concept of dominance to handle constraints and balance different constraints and objectives via normalization. The ultimate comparison is based on the product of these normalized values. Then we test the algorithm carefully using the 24 constrained benchmark problems on CEC2006. The experimental results show it works better than or competitive to a known effective algorithm. Finally we take ST5 antenna design as a real world test problem to verify its ability of solving real world problem. The simulation results are quite promising. Our approach is simple and straightforward, yet effective. Moreover, it has the potential of reducing parameter numbers in objective functions which are quite time consuming to be tuned. In our future work we will apply the algorithm in real antenna design.","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2008.26","startPage":"125","endPage":"132","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584238/4584239/04584264.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2008.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Antenna Design Using Normalized Steady State Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Genetic algorithms","Gain","Wire","Optimization","Feeds","Antennas and propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraint handling","genetic algorithms","microwave antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated antenna design","normalized steady state genetic algorithm","evolved X-band antenna","dominance concept","constraint handling","ST5 antenna design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Automated Antenna Design Using Normalized Steady State Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584264/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153830","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Antenna Design Using Normalized Steady State Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"3166a125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114547S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584238","isNumber":"4584239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584238","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4584239","articleId":"4584264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4584266,"authors":[{"name":"Alfred Grau","affiliation":["University of California at Irvine, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Alfred","lastName":"Grau","id":"37279037800"},{"name":"Jordi Romeu","affiliation":["Technical University of Catalonia, Spain"],"firstName":"Jordi","lastName":"Romeu","id":"37279006700"},{"name":"Lluis Jofre","affiliation":["Technical University of Catalonia, Spain"],"firstName":"Lluis","lastName":"Jofre","id":"37301258900"},{"name":"Franco De Flaviis","affiliation":["University of California at Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"De Flaviis","id":"37281511900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3166-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4584266","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":513},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Antennas and propagation","Antenna radiation patterns","Pixel","MIMO","Narrowband","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","microswitches","MIMO communication","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software defined MEMS-reconfigurable PIXEL-antenna","narrowband MIMO systems","multifunctional pixeled antenna","multiple-input multiple-output","microelectromechanical switches","narrowband communication systems","software defined radio architectures","radiation characteristics","return loss response"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","MEMS","reconfigurable antennas","software defined antenna"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose a software defined highly multifunctional pixeled antenna for narrowband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems, that uses micro electromechanical switches (MEMS) to reconfigure its radiation modes and operating frequency.

The usage of reconfigurable devices in safety critical fields, such as space or avionics, require the adoption of specific fault tolerant techniques, like triple modular redundancy (TMR), in order to protect their functionality against radiation effects. While these techniques allow increasing the protection capability against radiation effects, they introduce several penalties to the design, particularly in terms of performances. In this paper, we present a novel design flow able to implement fault tolerant circuits on SRAM-based FPGAs while reducing the performance penalties. The flow is based on a placement algorithm ruled by topology heuristics and on a routing algorithm driven by a congestion graph able to remove the crossing errors domains. Experimental evaluations performed by means of timing analysis and static analysis on industrial-like case studies demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is able to improve the running frequency up to the 44% versus standard TMR-based techniques while maintaining complete fault tolerance capabilities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153834","htmlLink":"/document/4584268/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Design Flow for the Performance Optimization of Fault Tolerant Circuits on SRAM-based FPGA's","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Design Flow for the Performance Optimization of Fault Tolerant Circuits on SRAM-based FPGA's","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"3166a157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065781S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584238","isNumber":"4584239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584238","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4584239","articleId":"4584268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4584273,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher P.

These missions enable opportunities in multiple-point sensing, greater communications capabilities and spacecraft redundancy. Requirements for processing and network capabilities have risen dramatically to meet strict needs of the end user and overcome various space disturbances and perturbations once in orbit. One such problem lies with a 'cluster' of satellites that have been deployed from the same launcher where they will be close together so ad-hoc technologies allow satellite communication. This paper addresses the hardware and software requirements for distributed computing opportunities using intersatellite connectivity. A system-on-a-chip design is proposed; including a general purpose processor core and a dedicated Java processing core to adapt and reconfigure the topology using real-time software Agent applications. This will make the network resilient to various space perturbations and ensure mission longevity. Integration of these two non-heterogeneous cores in a picosatellite technology demonstrator testbed and network topology reconfigurability procedures are also outlined.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual Core System-on-a-Chip Design to Support Inter-Satellite Communications","publicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2008.62","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584238/4584239/04584273.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2008.62","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Dual Core System-on-a-Chip Design to Support Inter-Satellite Communications","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584273/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153839","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual Core System-on-a-Chip Design to Support Inter-Satellite Communications","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"3166a191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044619S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584238","isNumber":"4584239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584238","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4584239","articleId":"4584273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4584277,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre Lorrentz","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, UK"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Lorrentz","id":"38271354100"},{"name":"Gareth Howells","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, UK"],"firstName":"Gareth","lastName":"Howells","id":"37347159500"},{"name":"Klaus McDonald-Maier","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Electronic Systems, University of Essex, Colchester, UK"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"McDonald-Maier","id":"38272117700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3166-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4584277","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Training","Hardware","Random access memory","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based adaptive weightless neural network hardware","artificial neural structures","weightless neural architecture","probabilistic convergent network","intelligent machine","PC-based system","Virtex-II pro","unconstrained handwritten numbers"]}],"abstract":"This paper explores the significant practical difficulties inherent in mapping large artificial neural structures onto digital hardware.

The HMMer software is a popular tool for aligning biological sequences to HMM models that represent biologic motifs. The results of these comparisons can be used to annotate domains of an unknown sequence or locate new members of a modelled family. But as the size of sequence and model repositories increases the time required to perform searches between entire databases becomes impractical. The HMMer engine is an example of this where extended searches can take up to days even with algorithmic improvements and software enhancements. This work describes the acceleration of the Viterbi decoding process by means of parallelizing the algorithm and mapping it to a systolic array. The concurrency of the arraypsilas processing elements is realized by implementing the engine on off-the-self FPGA hardware. Our implementation offers a 247times speedup over a software implementation of the HMMer tool on a standard desktop computer.","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2008.16","publicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584238/4584239/04584285.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2008.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High Performance Reconfigurable Core for Motif Searching Using Profile HMM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584285/","displayDocTitle":"A High Performance Reconfigurable Core for Motif Searching Using Profile HMM","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584285/","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153851","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High Performance Reconfigurable Core for Motif Searching Using Profile HMM","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"3166a285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042421S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584238","isNumber":"4584239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584238","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4584239","articleId":"4584285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":4584287,"authors":[{"name":"Wim Vanderbauwhede","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK","Institute for System Level Integration, Livingston, UK"],"firstName":"Wim","lastName":"Vanderbauwhede","id":"37430017300"},{"name":"Paul Mckechnie","affiliation":["Institute for System Level Integration, Livingston, UK"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Mckechnie","id":"37669451500"},{"name":"Chidambaram Thirunavukkarasu","affiliation":["Institute for System Level Integration, Livingston, UK"],"firstName":"Chidambaram","lastName":"Thirunavukkarasu","id":"38093839200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3166-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4584287","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584287","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","System-on-a-chip","IP networks","Payloads","Discrete cosine transforms","Cryptography","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gannet service manager","distributed dataflow controller","heterogeneous multicore SoC","generic interface","heterogeneous multicore system-on-chip","high-performance specialised processing unit","NoC-based SoC","heterogeneous IP cores","coarse-grained distributed computing platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["service-based architecture","Heterogeneous Multi-core SoCs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AHS.2008.14","publicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584238/4584239/04584287.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2008.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Gannet Service Manager: A Distributed Dataflow Controller for Heterogeneous Multi-core SoCs","abstract":"We present a novel circuit which acts as a generic interface for controlling the dataflow in a heterogeneous multicore system-on-chip (SoC).

CAMs have proved useful for implementing a number of applications that involve the need to match input data to stored data. This ability is a necessity when implementing cellular automata transition rule sets within hardware. A CAM matching process allows the next state of all cells in an automata space to be found efficiently in as little as a single clock cycle without the need for a complex memory searching algorithm. FPGAs are useful for creating cellular architectures as they are reconfigurable making it possible to model fault tolerance. Research into cellular architectures which can be made fault tolerant is of importance in the current era as faults are becoming increasingly common due to decreasing device dimensions and the increasing complexity of chips and the designs being implemented with them. The cells within the CAM architecture on the FPGA can be configured in different ways allowing it to adapt to varying system requirements and design density. This flexibility allows important factors such as look up table (LUT) usage and clock cycles per time step to be optimised during the design process.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer aided manufacturing","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Hardware","Random access memory","Automata","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular automata","content-addressable storage","field programmable gate arrays","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","cellular automata spaces","CAM based cellular architecture","content addressable memory","field programmable gate array","fault tolerance","lookup table"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584289","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2008.42","startPage":"315","endPage":"322","publicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584238/4584239/04584289.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2008.42","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584289/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Cellular Automata Spaces Using a CAM Based Cellular Architecture","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10153855","htmlLink":"/document/4584289/","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of Cellular Automata Spaces Using a CAM Based Cellular Architecture","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"3166a315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051448S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584238","isNumber":"4584239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584238","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4584239","articleId":"4584289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4584292,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Lamoureux","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Lamoureux","id":"37265861200"},{"name":"Wayne Luk","affiliation":["Imperial College London"],"firstName":"Wayne","lastName":"Luk","id":"37272281200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3166-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4584292","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":455},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Clocks","Routing","Solid modeling","Design automation","Power demand","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic CAD","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field-programmable gate arrays","system-level design","device-level design","energy consumption","computer-aided design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","low-power"]}],"abstract":"This paper provides an overview of low-power techniques for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

This allows the microprocessor to handle fast and complex MAC protocols while clocking at relatively slow speeds, thus consuming less power. The architecture on the whole is designed to be dynamically reconfigurable. It will handle data streams of multiple (up to 3) different protocol standards, by reconfiguring on a packet-by-packet basis. Results of simulation of packet transmission and reception on a prototype Simulink model indicate that a packet to packet reconfiguration for three concurrent data streams, while meeting protocol real-time requirements, will indeed be possible.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dynamically Reconfigurable Hardware Co-Processor for a Multi-Standard Wireless MAC Processor","publicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2008.54","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584238/4584239/04584296.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2008.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584296/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Dynamically Reconfigurable Hardware Co-Processor for a Multi-Standard Wireless MAC Processor","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584296/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153862","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamically Reconfigurable Hardware Co-Processor for a Multi-Standard Wireless MAC Processor","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"3166a368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056803S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584238","isNumber":"4584239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584238","xplore-issue":"4584239","articleId":"4584296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4584297,"authors":[{"name":"Parviz Palangpour","affiliation":["Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Missouri University of Science and Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Parviz","lastName":"Palangpour","id":"37847176600"},{"name":"Pinaki Mitra","affiliation":["Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Missouri University of Science and Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Pinaki","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37530187500"},{"name":"Swakshar Ray","affiliation":["Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Missouri University of Science and Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Swakshar","lastName":"Ray","id":"37381149800"},{"name":"Ganesh K.

The full nonlinear dynamics model describing the relative positioning of the MSFF system is used to develop an adaptive formation controller. First, the original nonlinear system is transformed into a linear controllable system with aperturbation term by invoking the input-output feedback linearization technique. Second, by using the integral feedback design scheme, the adaptive formation controller is presented for improving the steady-state performance of the MSFF system in the presence of unknown disturbances. Third, as a currently popular bio-inspired algorithm, PSO (particle swarm optimizer) is employed to minimize the total energy consumption under the required quality of service by jointly optimizing the transmission power and rate for each satellite. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive formation controller and the PSO-based optimization for saving the total communication energy.","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2008.60","publicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584238/4584239/04584304.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2008.60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584239","startPage":"432","endPage":"439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Formation Control and Bio-inspired Optimization of a Cluster-based Satellite Wireless Sensor Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Formation Control and Bio-inspired Optimization of a Cluster-based Satellite Wireless Sensor Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584304/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153870","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4584304/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Formation Control and Bio-inspired Optimization of a Cluster-based Satellite Wireless Sensor Network","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"3166a432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107411S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584238","isNumber":"4584239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584238","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4584239","articleId":"4584304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4584305,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe Capdepuy","affiliation":["Adaptive Systems Research Group, School of Computer Science, University of Herfordshire, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Capdepuy","id":"37698074300"},{"name":"Daniel Polani","affiliation":["Adaptive Systems Research Group, School of Computer Science, University of Herfordshire, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Polani","id":"37282130000"},{"name":"Chrystopher L.

Whether these are due to a change in environmental conditions or to alterations of the embodiment of the robot, flexibility and adaptation are essential qualities that can help it to keep operating in this new situation. This work is based on an information-theoretic approach and introduces an exploration strategy that allows an agent to detect and adapt to changes in its perception-action loop by actively sampling areas of interest. We define the problem of exploring the sensorimotor channel and establish a measure of the distance between the observed and the real model of the channel. An optimal Oracle-based strategy is used to compare performances of the adaptive sampling strategy and a random strategy. Results for different scenarios of change in a binary channel show that the proposed strategy is highly effective in many cases. We also outline principles to adapt this mechanism to the exploration of multiple channels and we give preliminary results for such a scenario.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2008.64","publicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584238/4584239/04584305.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"450","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2008.64","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptation of the Perception-Action Loop Using Active Channel Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptation of the Perception-Action Loop Using Active Channel Sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4584305/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153871","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584305/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptation of the Perception-Action Loop Using Active Channel Sampling","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"3166a443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054594S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584238","isNumber":"4584239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584238","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4584239","articleId":"4584305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4584310,"authors":[{"name":"Walid Riad Boukabou","affiliation":["Northern Ireland Science Park, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Walid Riad","lastName":"Boukabou","id":"37938876900"},{"name":"Ahmed Bouridane","affiliation":["Northern Ireland Science Park, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Bouridane","id":"37270849000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3166-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4584310","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":320},"abstract":"Face recognition is still a challenging task because face images can vary considerably in terms of facial expressions, lighting conditions, ... etc. It is commonly known that the use of multiresolution filter banks improve the recognition accuracy of image based biometric systems. In this paper, we propose to investigate the usefulness of the multiscale and directionality properties of the contourlet transform with a view to extract more discriminant features in order to further enhance the performance of the well known principal component analysis method when applied to face recognition. The proposed method has been extensively assessed using two different databases: the YALE Face Database and the FERET Database. A series of experiments have been carried out and a comparative study suggests the efficiency of the Contourlet Transform in enhancing the classification rates of a number of known face recognition algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584238/4584239/04584310.pdf","startPage":"482","endPage":"486","publicationTitle":"2008 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2008.11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2008.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contourlet-Based Feature Extraction with PCA for Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Face","Principal component analysis","Face recognition","Transforms","Filter bank","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","face recognition","feature extraction","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","principal component analysis","PCA","contourlet-based feature extraction","facial expressions","lighting conditions","multiresolution filter banks","biometric systems","contourlet transform","YALE Face Database","FERET Database"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Contourlet-Based Feature Extraction with PCA for Face Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584310/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153876","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contourlet-Based Feature Extraction with PCA for Face Recognition","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"3166a482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053876S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584238","isNumber":"4584239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584238","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4584239","articleId":"4584310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4584368,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chonnam National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38090484700"},{"name":"Myung-Eun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chonnam National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myung-Eun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37405523600"},{"name":"Soo-Hyung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chonnam National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Soo-Hyung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37404978800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3273-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4584368","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Ant colony optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms","Pixel","Optimization","Merging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image thresholding","ant colony optimization algorithm","metaheuristic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584368","abstract":"The Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is relatively a new meta-heuristic algorithm and a successful paradigm of all the algorithms which take advantage of the insectpsilas behavior.

As an advanced optimization algorithm, only recently, researchers began to apply ACO to image processing tasks. In this paper, an Improved Image Thresholding Method using Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm is proposed. Compared with traditional thresholding segmentation methods, the proposed method has advantages that it can nicely segment the thin, it can efficiently reduce calculation time, and it has good capability and stabilization nature. The results show that using the proposed method can achieve satisfactory segmentation effect.","doi":"10.1109/ALPIT.2008.105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALPIT.2008.105","startPage":"210","endPage":"215","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Advanced Language Processing and Web Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584318/4584319/04584368.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Advanced Language Processing and Web Information Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Image Thresholding Using Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Improved Image Thresholding Using Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584368/","accessionNumber":"10153952","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584368/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Image Thresholding Using Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"3273a210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039723S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584318","isNumber":"4584319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584318","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4584319","articleId":"4584368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4584426,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-hui Huang","affiliation":["Information Science and Technology College, Dalian Maritime University Dalian, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Ying-hui","lastName":"Huang","id":"37536894900"},{"name":"Guan-yu Li","affiliation":["Information Science and Technology College, Dalian Maritime University Dalian, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Guan-yu","lastName":"Li","id":"37405542600"},{"name":"Shuai Mu","affiliation":["Information Science and Technology College, Dalian Maritime University Dalian, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Mu","id":"37085986538"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3273-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4584426","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"abstract":"The semantic Web service retrieval model in popular had put forth by foreign scholars does not take full account of the differences between the languages, and the service request needs to do Chinese word segmentation firstly in Chinese retrieval.

Elevated die temperatures are detrimental to circuit performance and reliability. Furthermore, hot spots due to spatially nonuniform heat flux in ICs can cause physical stress that further reduces reliability. The authors of this article review various chip-cooling techniques that have been proposed in the literature. They then present an alternative approach based on a recently invented digital-microfluidic platform that enables an adaptive cooling technique. This novel digital-fluid-handling platform uses a phenomenon known as electrowetting so that a vast array of discrete droplets of liquid, ranging from microliters to nanoliters and potentially to picoliters, can be independently moved along a substrate. Although this technology was originally developed for a biological and chemical lab on a chip, the authors show how it can be adapted for use as a fully reconfigurable, adaptive cooling platform.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/54/4584443/04584466.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","doi":"10.1109/MDT.2008.87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MDT.2008.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584443","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Digital-Microfluidic Approach to Chip Cooling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cooling","Temperature","Thermal stresses","Heat sinks","Substrates","Microfluidics","Thermal management","Chemical technology","Fans","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooling","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit reliability","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","thermal management (packaging)","wetting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital microfluidic approach","chip cooling","thermal management","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit reliability","spatially nonuniform heat flux","adaptive cooling","digital fluid handling","electrowetting","biological lab on a chip","chemical lab on a chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["chip cooling","fluid flow","heat removal","microfluidics","digital microfluidics","reconfigurability","adaptive cooling platform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Digital-Microfluidic Approach to Chip Cooling","volume":"25","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4584466/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10160426","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Digital-Microfluidic Approach to Chip Cooling","sourcePdf":"mdt2008040372.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049778S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"54","isNumber":"4584443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"54","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4584443","articleId":"4584466","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4584481,"authors":[{"name":"Jonas Friden","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Antenna Research Center, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"Friden","id":"37318555700"},{"name":"Martin Siegbahn","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, EMF Health and Safety, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Siegbahn","id":"38356967800"},{"name":"Bjorn Thors","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, EMF Health and Safety, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bjorn","lastName":"Thors","id":"37282530800"},{"name":"Lennart Hamberg","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, EMF Health and Safety, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Lennart","lastName":"Hamberg","id":"37300095800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-92-9092-937-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"4584481","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Imaging phantoms","Electric variables measurement","Current measurement","Volume measurement","Time measurement","Specific absorption rate","Mobile handsets","Base stations","Mobile antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological effects of fields","electromagnetic wave absorption","mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["specific absorption rate","quick SAR assessment","dual-plane measurement","amplitude-only measurement","mobile phones","radio base station antennas","electric field strength","sparse volumetric scanning","surface scanning","plane wave spectrum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Specific Absorption Rate","Dosimetric","Phase retrieval","Field propagation","Plane wave spectrum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584481","abstract":"Current standardized procedures for measurements of the Specific absorption rate (SAR) of mobile phones and radio base station antennas include a volumetric scan of the electric field strength induced in a head or body phantom. Assessment of multi-band and whole-body SAR requires repeated volumetric scanning over a large part of the phantom and is time-consuming. In order to reduce the total evaluation time, different methods have been proposed to estimate the SAR from measurement data based on sparse volumetric scanning and surface scanning. These methods rely on data fitting with underlying assumptions about the spatial distribution of the fields. In order not to be biased by previous or current antenna design, and to be able to use currently available assessment systems, a model-independent dual-plane-scan method is investigated based on amplitude measurements of the electric field components. The amplitude of the electric field components are measured in two planes close to the phantom surface, and the phase is recovered using an iterative process. The plane wave spectrum of the resulting complex electric field components is then used to propagate the field into the phantom. The measurement time is typically reduced by a factor 5 and in some cases even more. Furthermore, the plane wave spectrum is utilized for fast calculation of the mass-averaged local SAR values. A numerical tolerance study, using single and multi- peak fields with relevant errors superposed, is performed to demonstrate the robustness of the method. The resulting errors in the estimated SAR values are below 1% for realistic positioning errors and signal to noise ratio. Comparisons with measurements in a flat phantom are also made. Moreover, the underlying algorithm can be applied to curved surfaces.","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584481","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584481.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quick SAR assessment using dual-plane amplitude-only measurement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Quick SAR assessment using dual-plane amplitude-only measurement","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584481/","accessionNumber":"10174712","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584481/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quick SAR assessment using dual-plane amplitude-only measurement","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID439165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052856S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4584482,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanyuan Fei","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, Image Processing University of Edinburgh, UK"],"lastName":"Yuanyuan Fei","id":"37834133000"},{"name":"Buon Kiong Lau","affiliation":["Department of Electroscience, Lund University, Sweden"],"lastName":"Buon Kiong Lau","id":"37285007500"},{"name":"Anders Sunesson","affiliation":["Perlos AB, Sweden"],"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Sunesson","id":"37344560300"},{"name":"Anders J.

This paper explores the performance of uncoupled terminations under different incident field assumptions. The analysis shows that under certain impinging fields, an uncoupled load can be designed whose performance matches that of the optimal termination. However, as the incident field exhibits reduced directional bias, the performance of the optimized load tends to degrade. This observation suggests that one role of the termination is to effectively form a beam that is matched to the incident field structure.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584483.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal uncoupled impedance matching for coupled MIMO arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance matching","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Optimal matching","Mutual coupling","Electromagnetic coupling","Antennas and propagation","Termination of employment","Voltage","Loaded antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584483/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Optimal uncoupled impedance matching for coupled MIMO arrays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584483/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal uncoupled impedance matching for coupled MIMO arrays","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID446934.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036187S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESA","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4584495,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this paper the focus is on modeling of thin material sheets and coatings in the finite-element time-domain method. The proposed method is based on degenerated prism elements, so-called shell elements. For a dielectric sheet the thickness is assumed small compared to the wavelength for all frequencies of interest. An important characteristic of the method is that it takes the discontinuity of the normal electric field component at a dielectric interface into account. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated for a couple of scattering cases.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584523.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the modeling of thin sheets and coatings in the time-domain finite-element method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coatings","Time domain analysis","Finite element methods","Dielectric materials","Sheet materials","Frequency","Radar antennas","Mathematical model","Electromagnetic modeling","Radar scattering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"On the modeling of thin sheets and coatings in the time-domain finite-element method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584523/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the modeling of thin sheets and coatings in the time-domain finite-element method","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID450556.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048227S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESA","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4584525,"authors":[{"name":"Celestin Tamgue Famdie","affiliation":["BenQ Mobile GmbH & Co., Kamp-Lintfort, Germany"],"firstName":"Celestin Tamgue","lastName":"Famdie","id":"37550233400"},{"name":"Werner L.

These advancements include (a) multiple aperture dual-band reflector antennas, (b) high efficiency horns covering 50% bandwidth, (c) a novel \"stepped-reflector antenna\" (SRA) technology, and (d) reconfigurable beam antennas for HIEO and GEO satellites. It is shown that by combining the reflector improvements through the use of SRA with the feed improvements through the use of dual-band high efficiency horns (DBHEH), significant improvements in EIRP, G/T, and co-polar isolation (C/I) can be achieved. The SRA system produces \"flat-top\" radiation patterns for receive beams and highly efficient Gaussian patterns for transmit beams over a geographic coverage as seen by the satellite. The DBHEH designs employ ?slope-discontinuities? to generate desired higher order modes over both transmit and receive bands. By employing a ?frequency-dependant? horn design for the DBHEH, it is shown that the step size can be significantly reduced and can be easily blended into the reflector surface for ease of fabrication. Detailed design of a K/Ka band MBA with about 68 spot beams is presented. The RF performance of this novel MBA has been evaluated and shows significant improvements in EIRP, G/T, and C/I in comparison with a conventional MBA. Comparison results of the advanced MBA with conventional MBA are presented in the paper. Design examples for both FSS and DBS satellites are discussed. A novel reconfigurable antenna suitable for HIEO and GEO satellites has been developed at LMCSS. It employs a non-focused reflector (NFR) antenna using a shaped mesh-reflector, and a small active feed array located in the focal-plane of the NFR in order to continuously reconfigure the beam(s), as the satellite goes through the HIEO orbit. The NFR approach has the advantages of reducing the number of feed array elements significantly while achieving the desired beam flexibility. Feed technology advancement for FSS and BSS satellites that includes high efficiency horns, trifurcated horns, feed networks, and trends in high power TVAC testing are briefly discussed.","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584624","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584624.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced antenna technologies for satellite communication payloads","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Advanced antenna technologies for satellite communication payloads","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584624/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4584624/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced antenna technologies for satellite communication payloads","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID451464.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032344S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4584655,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroshi Sato","affiliation":["Panasonic Mobile Communications Company Limited, Japan","Panasonic Mobile Communications Co.

It is preferable to have a smaller and more efficient antenna system for the MIMO terminal. Although built-in antennas are more convenient, coupling between antennas and the human body is larger than with extended antennas. So far, for the built-in elements, we have proposed a folded loop antenna (FLA) with balanced feed and a parallel plane antenna (PPA) with unbalanced feed. Because of the smaller human effects, these antennas may work effectively as MIMO antenna arrays. In this paper, 3 types of 2times2 MIMO antenna are investigated to show the effectiveness of the built-in antenna array for the terminal in a multi-pass wave environment. The channel capacity is employed to estimate the antenna performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584655.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small array antenna for 2x2 MIMO terminal using folded loop antenna","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","MIMO communication","mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna array","MIMO terminal","mobile phones","high-speed data communication","built-in elements","folded loop antenna","FLA","parallel plane antenna","PPA","MIMO antenna arrays","human effects","channel capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Small array antenna for 2x2 MIMO terminal using folded loop antenna","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584655/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10152835","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small array antenna for 2x2 MIMO terminal using folded loop antenna","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID451592.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060887S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4584657,"authors":[{"name":"Jussi Rahola","affiliation":["Nokia Group, Nokia Research Center, Finland"],"firstName":"Jussi","lastName":"Rahola","id":"37284178700"},{"name":"Jani Ollikainen","affiliation":["Nokia Group, Nokia Research Center, Finland"],"firstName":"Jani","lastName":"Ollikainen","id":"37273180400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-92-9092-937-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"4584657","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":1139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile antennas","Resonance","Mobile handsets","Bandwidth","Impedance","Probes","Frequency estimation","Resonant frequency","Antenna feeds","Antenna theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","cavity resonators","mobile antennas","telecommunication terminals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal antenna placement","mobile terminals","characteristic mode analysis","ground plane resonances","patch-type antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["small antennas","mobile terminal antennas","antenna placement","characteristic mode analysis"]}],"abstract":"When an electrically small antenna element is placed on a small finite ground plane, as in mobile terminals, the ground plane resonances strongly affect the impedance and radiation characteristics of the antenna system. In this paper, we show how characteristic mode analysis can predict the optimal locations of antennas on finite ground planes. As patch-type antennas couple to the ground plane resonances mainly through the electric field, it is natural that the strongest coupling and thus the maximum impedance bandwidth is obtained when the antenna element is placed at the maximum of the electric field of a ground plane mode. This is verified by moving a small probe antenna at selected locations over a rectangular 100 mm by 40 mm ground plane and by computing the obtainable bandwidth at each point.","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584657","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584657.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal antenna placement for mobile terminals using characteristic mode analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal antenna placement for mobile terminals using characteristic mode analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584657/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10152836","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4584657/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal antenna placement for mobile terminals using characteristic mode analysis","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID451595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064534S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4584668,"authors":[{"name":"Naoki Honma","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Naoki Honma","id":"37277559500"},{"name":"Kentaro Nishimori","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Kentaro Nishimori","id":"37264894100"},{"name":"Yasushi Takatori","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Yasushi Takatori","id":"37265912800"},{"name":"Atsushi Ohta","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Atsushi Ohta","id":"37276002800"},{"name":"Koichi Tsunekawa","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Koichi Tsunekawa","id":"37277573000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-92-9092-937-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"4584668","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polarization","Antenna radiation patterns","MIMO","Dipole antennas","Switches","Transmitting antennas","Antennas and propagation","Circuits","Channel capacity","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","polarization","pattern","antenna selection"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a simple antenna selection method that is suitable for the MIMO (Multi-Input Multi-Output) terminal antenna employing orthogonal polarizations and patterns. The combination of the antenna elements with the orthogonal polarizations and patterns is effective in reducing the antenna coupling and spatial correlation. As a basic consideration, a configuration of three orthogonal dipoles, which is the simplest configuration with orthogonal polarizations and patterns, is investigated to clarify the effectiveness of the antenna selection method. In this method, the vertical antennas, which tend to exhibit a high signal-to-noise ratio, are always used. This method allows the use of a fairly simple RF-switch circuit because the number of the antenna combinations is reduced. Based on numerical analysis, the proposed method provides channel capacity that is as high as that provided by the ideal antenna selection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna selection method employing orthogonal polarization and radiation patterns for MIMO antenna","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584668","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584668.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Antenna selection method employing orthogonal polarization and radiation patterns for MIMO antenna","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584668/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna selection method employing orthogonal polarization and radiation patterns for MIMO antenna","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID452098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057862S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESA","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4584673,"authors":[{"name":"Joaquim Bastos","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Universit\u00e1rio de Santiago, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Joaquim","lastName":"Bastos","id":"37557493900"},{"name":"Atilio Gameiro","affiliation":[" Campus Universit\u00e1rio de Santiago, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Atilio","lastName":"Gameiro","id":"37270506000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-92-9092-937-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"4584673","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"abstract":"In this paper we consider a transmission system based on MC-CDMA, where signal spreading is performed entirely in the frequency domain.

The design is focused to be a compact model, suitable for being used in relatively small terminals. Given the small size of the designs, the idea is not to substitute the use multiple antennas for one element with multiple modes but to combine multiple compact multi-mode antennas. To this aim, the design of two small multi-mode patch antennas is presented as well as a study of channel spectral efficiency. Spectral efficiency is computed comparing several multi-element-multimode antennas scenarios to alternative scenarios with single-mode antennas. For spectral efficiency studies it is necessary to model the MIMO channel taking into account that multiple-element-multiple-mode antennas will be used.

Simulated and measured results have been studied in the four arms SMI (sample matrix inversion) as compared with a single antenna receiver. Two channel conditions, AWGN channel and multipath channel (taking account the fading correlation), have been modelled and studied to quantify WLAN performance degradations but also to evaluate the efficiency of a multi element antennas system at the receiver to improve significantly the performances of a wireless system.

A simple formula to predict the channel capacity and spectral efficiency for MIMO wireless systems are derived. These formulas are numerically calculated for different urban areas and fading situations and are compared with those obtained for single-input-single-output (SISO) wireless systems.

Most studies have investigated MIMO channel characteristics by normalizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) out of the channel matrix. However, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios with rich multipath often experience low SNR. On the other hand, scenarios with line of sight (LOS) usually have high SNR but low multipath richness. The relationship between SNR and multipath richness are studied in this paper using urban environment measurements conducted at 2.53 GHz in downtown Oulu, Finland within a bandwidth of 100 MHz. We investigate a variety of MIMO channel parameters including the small-scale fading characteristics, delay dispersion, and correlation property as well as wideband channel capacity during as the transition from the LOS to the NLOS cases. Also, the polarization dependency on the LOS/NLOS condition is investigated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Empirical characteristics of urban macrocell multiple-input multiple-output channel at 2.53 GHz","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584730","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584730.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Empirical characteristics of urban macrocell multiple-input multiple-output channel at 2.53 GHz","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584730/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empirical characteristics of urban macrocell multiple-input multiple-output channel at 2.53 GHz","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID453240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034622S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESA","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4584731,"authors":[{"name":"Lajos Nagy","affiliation":["Department of Broadband Infocommunications and Electromagnetic Theory, Budapest University\uc2a0of\uc2a0Technology\uc2a0and\uc2a0Economics, Hungary"],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Nagy","id":"37300291000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-92-9092-937-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"4584731","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Indoor environments","Electromagnetic scattering","Finite difference methods","Transmitting antennas","Lattices","Boundary conditions","Broadband antennas","Stochastic systems","Dipole antennas"]}],"abstract":"The multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antenna can give recently a promise in increasing the capacity of wireless radio systems.

Also several options regarding signal combination at system level were studied, assuming two base stations with 2 antennas each. As a result, it is shown that the 2\u00d74 configuration with base station selection and waterfilling scheme provides almost as good performance as a 4\u00d74 full waterfilling scheme when the 2 base stations are spatially separated.

We especially focus on the simple case of a two hops transmission.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Ad hoc networks","Relays","Power system relaying","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","Decoding","Interference","Circuit noise","Degradation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ad hoc","non-regenerative relay","UWB"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584738","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584738.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multihop channel model in UWB ad hoc networks at 60 GHz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multihop channel model in UWB ad hoc networks at 60 GHz","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584738/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584738/","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multihop channel model in UWB ad hoc networks at 60 GHz","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID456216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.220815S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4584748,"authors":[{"name":"Eliana Yepez","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Canada"],"firstName":"Eliana","lastName":"Yepez","id":"37736398900"},{"name":"David Falconer","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Canada"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Falconer","id":"37273312500"},{"name":"Robert Bultitude","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Canada"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Bultitude","id":"37295145800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-92-9092-937-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"4584748","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Velocity measurement","Bandwidth","Internet","Performance analysis","Transmitters","Rayleigh channels","Shadow mapping","Tail","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple input multiple output system","outdoor channel measurements","indoor channel measurements","fixed wireless applications","transmitter","Rayleigh channels","channel capacity estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO single user","channel capacity","Outdoor to indoor channel measurements","Fixed wideband MIMO channels","Shadowing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we estimate the channel performance in terms of ergodic and outage rates based on measured channels in a university campus type of environment. The characteristics of the channels we measure are: (4 times 4) MIMO (multiple input multiple output) single user channels with non line of sight, outdoor to indoor, having wide bandwidths for fixed wireless applications (e.g., high speed Internet wireless). The striking result of this analysis is that even though we have estimated that our measured MIMO channels have uncorrelated matrix elements there is a significant decrease in performance for the case of no channel knowledge at the transmitter in terms of outage rates with respect to the outage rates of iid Rayleigh channels of the same order. We find that this is due to shadowing effects that cause a variation in the received SNR generating a significant increase in the lower tail of the pdf of the channel capacity.","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584748","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584748.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimated capacities for a multiple input multiple output system based on outdoor to indoor channel measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimated capacities for a multiple input multiple output system based on outdoor to indoor channel measurements","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584748/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10174689","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4584748/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimated capacities for a multiple input multiple output system based on outdoor to indoor channel measurements","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID457285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067686S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4584749,"authors":[{"name":"Helmut Hofstetter","affiliation":["Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Helmut","lastName":"Hofstetter","id":"37328429200"},{"name":"Andreas F.

From processing indoor measurements at 2.55 GHz and 5.25 GHz, we found that cluster parameters show significant correlations which have to be considered in the channel models in order to be physically relevant.

PSO developed by Kennedy and Eberhart [1] while trying to model the swarm behaviour of bees has surprisingly revealed interesting capabilities as an optimiser in general and recently in the area of EM- optimisation. Particularly the aspect of designing Frequency Selective Surfaces (FSS) as part of a radome is quite difficult to handle due to the inherent multi-modal and multi-dimensional nature of this kind of problem. In order to attack such defiances Genetic Algorithms (GA) have been used in the past in different implementations and versions like GA, parallel GA, Micro-GA and others. All these genetic algorithms feature a lot of tuneable system parameters affecting overall performance of the optimiser very much. This makes it rather difficult to find a suitable and / or optimal system parameter setting of the optimiser to be able to handle a given problem efficiently. PSO in contrast is equipped with an appealing small number of system parameters. This circumstance makes PSO very interesting for the development engineer in general.","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584765","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584765.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of frequency-selective radomes using parallel Particle Swarm Optimisation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Design optimization","Frequency selective surfaces","Process design","Shape","Genetic algorithms","Dielectric materials","Electromagnetics","Bandwidth","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic waves","frequency selective surfaces","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","radomes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-selective radomes","parallel particle swarm optimisation","electromagnetics community","EM-optimisation","frequency selective surface","genetic algorithm","tuneable system parameter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimisation","PSO","Frequency Selective Surfaces","FSS","Radome"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Design of frequency-selective radomes using parallel Particle Swarm Optimisation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584765/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10152869","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of frequency-selective radomes using parallel Particle Swarm Optimisation","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID458540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055219S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4584779,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Fugen","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr H\u00f6chstfrequenztechnik und Elektronik (IHE), Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Fugen","id":"37284439100"},{"name":"Malgorzata Porebska","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr H\u00f6chstfrequenztechnik und Elektronik (IHE), Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Malgorzata","lastName":"Porebska","id":"37294137400"},{"name":"Sandra Knorzer","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr H\u00f6chstfrequenztechnik und Elektronik (IHE), Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Sandra","lastName":"Knorzer","id":"37847947300"},{"name":"Jurgen Maurer","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr H\u00f6chstfrequenztechnik und Elektronik (IHE), Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Jurgen","lastName":"Maurer","id":"37265482200"},{"name":"Werner Wiesbeck","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr H\u00f6chstfrequenztechnik und Elektronik (IHE), Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Werner","lastName":"Wiesbeck","id":"37281044700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-92-9092-937-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"4584779","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Wireless LAN","Mobile communication","Wideband","Optical propagation","Cities and towns","Wide area networks","Communication channels","Delay","Distribution functions"]}],"abstract":"3D ray tracing has meanwhile advanced to a performance that it can provide channel parameters such as delay spread, Doppler spread, angular spread, distribution functions of long- and short-term fading with high accuracy for fixed to mobile and mobile to mobile communications.

Each of these components behaves quite differently, when considered in terms of its temporal and spatial variability. Separation of the different atmospheric contributions (also called separation effects) is an essential step for the improvement of propagation model. Our aim in this study is to develop and valid an artificial neural network (ANN) able to separate out the contribution of different atmospheric component. A wide simulated database, corresponding to different sets of meteorological conditions is used to train the ANN. The selection of input variables among following quantities: attenuation at one, two or three frequencies, humidity, pressure, and temperature at ground level, is performed in computing their relative contribution to output. The best ANN obtained is thus validated with actual measured attenuations performed during Olympus experiment. The validation of separation effects is performed by the comparison of rain attenuation statistics.","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584797","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584797.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Validation of a neural network model for the separation of atmospheric effects on attenuation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Atmospheric modeling","Attenuation","Artificial neural networks","Frequency","Rain","Gases","Clouds","Computational modeling","Spatial databases"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Validation of a neural network model for the separation of atmospheric effects on attenuation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584797/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Validation of a neural network model for the separation of atmospheric effects on attenuation","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID461121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058662S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4584805,"authors":[{"name":"Pavel Valtr","affiliation":["Department of Electromagnetic Field, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Pavel","lastName":"Valtr","id":"37294433800"},{"name":"Pavel Pechac","affiliation":["Department of Electromagnetic Field, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Pavel","lastName":"Pechac","id":"37284186000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-92-9092-937-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"4584805","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"abstract":"Prediction methods in tropospheric electromagnetic wave propagation primarily rely on ray-tracing and parabolic equation. While the parabolic equation approach represents a full-wave method of wave equation solution, ray-tracing methods make use of the ray-concept taken from physical optics. Although ray-tracing is not capable of giving exact field strength/phase in general cases, it does provide a useful tool for illustrating atmospheric refraction effects. The main advantage of the ray-tracing concept lies in the relative simplicity of its implementation. The aim of this paper is to introduce an analytic ray-based method of field amplitude/phase computation to consider the refractive properties of the atmosphere, represented by a refractive index gradient.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584805.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytic tropospheric ray-tracing model for constant refractivity gradient profiles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Refractive index","Atmosphere","Electromagnetic propagation","Equations","Geometrical optics","Optical refraction","Radiowave propagation","Optical propagation","Optical transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave propagation","parabolic equations","ray tracing","refractive index"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analytic tropospheric ray-tracing model","prediction methods","tropospheric electromagnetic wave propagation","parabolic equation","full-wave method","wave equation solution","physical optics","atmospheric refraction effects","field amplitude computation","field phase computation","refractive index gradient"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Analytic tropospheric ray-tracing model for constant refractivity gradient profiles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584805/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10174733","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytic tropospheric ray-tracing model for constant refractivity gradient profiles","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID461149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032793S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4584814,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Once the impact of the OBFN has been studied, different improvements are introduced like the use of erbiumdoped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs), avalanche photodetectors (APDs), RF phase shifters and RF power amplifiers, leading to a solution suitable for large arrays.

Wideband radio channel measurements can be approximated using concentrated propagation paths with an accuracy of close to 100% down to only 30% or less, depending on the scenario. For this reason it has been proposed to extend the data model by an additional component describing the distributed scattering (dense multipath component, DMC) of the radio channel. The model for the DMC is parameterized by three parameters, a base delay, the coherence bandwidth or delay-spread, and the attenuation factor of the dense multipath component. It is shown in this paper that the distributed scattering contributes significantly to the capacity of the MIMO-wideband radio channel. In fact it can be observed in channel sounding measurements that the distributed scattering can contribute more to the channel capacity than the concentrated propagation paths.","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584832","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584832.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed scattering in radio channels and its contribution to MIMO channel capacity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed scattering in radio channels and its contribution to MIMO channel capacity","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584832/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10152902","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4584832/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed scattering in radio channels and its contribution to MIMO channel capacity","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID461258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091089S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4584846,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In order to study the MIMO channel characteristics when multiple polarizations are considered, a measurement campaign was carried out by using a custom MIMO testbed. Both single and dual-polarized antennas were used, and several scenarios were measured, including indoor and outdoor transmitter location. The capacity analysis showed that the dual-polarized antennas offer a higher diversity for both indoor and outdoor to indoor scenarios when the receiver is moved along corridor routes. However, when the antenna gain is also considered, the achieved capacity for indoor office-like scenarios was slightly lower for the dual-polarized antennas, due to the lower antenna gain of the used elements.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584846.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of mimo single and multi-polarized measured channels in indoor WLAN scenarios","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Wireless LAN","Polarization","Antenna measurements","Antennas and propagation","Receiving antennas","Testing","Transmitting antennas","Directive antennas","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","indoor radio","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO single and multipolarized measured channels","indoor WLAN scenarios","dualpolarized antennas","multiple inputs and multiple outputs channel characteristics","indoor transmitter location","outdoor transmitter location","receiver","antenna gain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584846/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of mimo single and multi-polarized measured channels in indoor WLAN scenarios","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584846/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10152917","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of mimo single and multi-polarized measured channels in indoor WLAN scenarios","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID461766.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063796S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4584847,"authors":[{"name":"Celal Alp Tunc","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Celal Alp","lastName":"Tunc","id":"37391885000"},{"name":"Erdinc Irci","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erdinc","lastName":"Irci","id":"37543026700"},{"name":"Onur Bakir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"Bakir","id":"37847324400"},{"name":"Defne Aktas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Defne","lastName":"Aktas","id":"37299798500"},{"name":"Vakur B.

The evaluation has been performed over the spatial channel model developed for MIMO simulations according to 802.16e case of 3GPP.25.996, taking also into account all IF and RF stages. Orthogonality has been applied in space-frequency dimension for preamble, pilot, as well as for the data symbols. In 4G multicarrier systems, multidimensional orthogonal coding design turns into a key factor for the performance of the system, something which is quite challenging in highly time-variant propagation channels. The proposed estimation approach is efficient in minimization of the processing requirements at the receiver by estimating only the time-varying channel properties. The presented results refer to MSE of the estimator, as well as to overall performance of the system (BER) in various propagation channels, data rates and FEC modes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient channel estimation scheme for realistic SFBC MISO OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584855","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584855.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584855","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"An efficient channel estimation scheme for realistic SFBC MISO OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584855/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient channel estimation scheme for realistic SFBC MISO OFDM systems","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID462410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050335S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEESA","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4584857,"authors":[{"name":"Bjorn Lindmark","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, KTH, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bjorn","lastName":"Lindmark","id":"37278278500"},{"name":"Laura Garcia-Garcia","affiliation":["Department SSR, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Garcia-Garcia","id":"38275069800"},{"name":"Niklas Jalden","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, KTH, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Niklas","lastName":"Jalden","id":"37283154900"},{"name":"Charlie Orlenius","affiliation":["Bluetest AB, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Charlie","lastName":"Orlenius","id":"37266279200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-92-9092-937-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"4584857","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna arrays","Reverberation chamber","Antenna measurements","Antenna radiation patterns","Antenna theory","Antennas and propagation","Mobile antennas","Wireless LAN","Azimuth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity","PIFA","monopole"]}],"abstract":"We have compared different methods of evaluating arrays for MIMO systems.

In previous studies up to 10 dB difference was found in TRP of a mobile handset between individual users. Our objective is to investigate the reasons for the large differences. Thirteen test persons were measured with an active GSM 900/1800 mobile phone. The standard deviation of the TRP results between the test persons was relatively low when the test persons held the phone in a predefined talk position. The variation in the corresponding results was much larger when the users could freely select the talk position. The variable hand position and the grip on the handset seems to be the major reason for the large differences whereas the anatomical differences between the users play only a smaller role.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User effect on total radiated power and 3-D radiation pattern of mobile handsets","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584873","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584873.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"User effect on total radiated power and 3-D radiation pattern of mobile handsets","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584873/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User effect on total radiated power and 3-D radiation pattern of mobile handsets","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID462483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069125S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4584874,"authors":[{"name":"Joonas Krogerus","affiliation":["Radio Technologies Laboratory, Nokia Group, Nokia Research Center, Finland","IDC/SMARAD/Radio Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Joonas","lastName":"Krogerus","id":"37284177200"},{"name":"Pasi Suvikunnas","affiliation":["IDC/SMARAD/Radio Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Pasi","lastName":"Suvikunnas","id":"37280830800"},{"name":"Clemens Icheln","affiliation":["IDC/SMARAD/Radio Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Clemens","lastName":"Icheln","id":"37273178800"},{"name":"Pertti Vainikainen","affiliation":["IDC/SMARAD/Radio Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Pertti","lastName":"Vainikainen","id":"37280837800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-92-9092-937-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"4584874","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"abstract":"We investigate the significance of phase information of radiation patterns for the performance estimates of diversity and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna configurations at 2 GHz band.

In the performance analysis we use the Experimental Plane-Wave Based Method (EPWBM) where 3-D radiation patterns of the antennas and measured 3-D signal distribution of the propagation environment are combined. The results show that use of phaseless radiation patterns leads to unacceptable underestimation of performance of multielement antenna systems. However, the use of a random phasing technique with phaseless radiation patterns is shown to be an attractive method for simplifying the antenna evaluation process.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584874.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of diversity and MIMO performance of antennas from phaseless radiation patterns","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna radiation patterns","Receiving antennas","Antenna measurements","Transmitting antennas","Antennas and propagation","Signal processing","Diversity reception","Radio transmitters","Laboratories"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of diversity and MIMO performance of antennas from phaseless radiation patterns","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584874/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of diversity and MIMO performance of antennas from phaseless radiation patterns","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID462490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064641S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4584877,"authors":[{"name":"Tetsuro Imai","affiliation":["NTT DoCoMo, Inc., Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuro","lastName":"Imai","id":"37305697300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-92-9092-937-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"4584877","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Acceleration","Genetic algorithms","Radio propagation","Accuracy","Radio transmitters","Receivers","Computer simulation","Computer errors","Application software"]}],"abstract":"The ray-tracing method is very attractive because several radio propagation characteristics can be simply predicted based on the knowledge of the rays geometrically traced from the transmitter to the receiver. However, when taking many structures into consideration, many rays must be traced in order to achieve a high level of prediction accuracy, and this is very time consuming. Accelerating the ray-tracing process while maintaining a high level of prediction accuracy is an important problem that needs to be addressed. This paper proposes a ray-tracing acceleration technique employing the Genetic algorithm called the GA_RT method. The performance is evaluated based on computer simulation and the results show that the number of calculations can be reduced to approximately 20% if 4 dB is within the allowable calculation error. Moreover, when there are many calculation points in a wide area, application of the Chain model is proposed in conjunction with the GA_RT method. By using this combination, the computation time is minimized to approximately 6% with the calculation error of approximately 1 dB.","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584877","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584877.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel ray-tracing acceleration technique employing genetic algorithm for radio propagation prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584877/","displayDocTitle":"Novel ray-tracing acceleration technique employing genetic algorithm for radio propagation prediction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584877/","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel ray-tracing acceleration technique employing genetic algorithm for radio propagation prediction","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID463115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045427S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4584885,"authors":[{"name":"Khalid G.

We are mainly interested in the double-directional channel response of each frequency band and especially in the degree of similarity between them. In principle, when a frequency division duplex (FDD) system is deployed (like in UMTS) it is really challenging to study whether the measurement results of the uplink could be mapped to the downlink direction (and vice versa). In our study two different beamformers as well as the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm are included in order to assess the angular domain performance of both bands. The initial results reveal that joint spectra exhibit a noticeable degree of similarity implying that the two bands are characterised by the same propagation mechanisms. Evidently, the crucial issue is to investigate whether these measurement results could be exploited in future practical FDD systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency correlation of an indoor MIMO channel","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584895","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584895.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Frequency correlation of an indoor MIMO channel","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584895/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10174606","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency correlation of an indoor MIMO channel","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID463190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042413S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4584902,"authors":[{"name":"M.

With this method each RF chain is not allocated to a single element but instead to the combined and weighted output of a subarray of elements and thus achieves decreased receiver hardware complexity, since less downconverters and analog-to-digital converters are required with respect to the full system.

The idea in using this device is to place it in front of a particular antenna in order to modify the radiation pattern of the feeding antenna. The architecture that is being applied implies the use of patches with via feeding. To avoid undesired coupling between the reception and the transmission arrays, ground planes that isolate the reception array, the phase delay and the transmission array are placed. In this paper the phase delay part, the radiation part and the whole structure are analyzed and simulated. Finally, some prototypes for the phase delay structure are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04584983.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4584983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a double array lens","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical design","Lenses","Phased arrays","Delay","Antenna feeds","Antenna accessories","Antenna radiation patterns","Couplings","Analytical models","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","lens antennas","microstrip antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double array lens","transmitarray","patch array","radiation pattern","feeding antenna","phase delay","reception arrays","transmission arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4584983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Design of a double array lens","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4584983/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10174653","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a double array lens","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID533126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068426S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4584983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4584988,"authors":[{"name":"Max van de Kamp","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electron.

This paper presents a method for optimal design of switched beam planar antenna arrays based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Switched beam antenna arrays are a subset of smart antennas that that can enhance the capacity of a cellular system. PSO is a population based algorithm that exploits a set of potential solutions to the optimization problem, which are determined on the basis of social interactions between independent agents. The synthesis problem addressed is to find spatial and feeding configuration of array elements that conform to certain design constraints enforced on multiple diagrams of differentiated directive gains and values (beam forming). Two different fitness functions were evaluated on this basis; results obtained were correlated to requirements of vertical system integration. The proposed methodology is very flexible allowing the incorporation of additional factors such as coupling characteristics and feeding network constraints.","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4585004","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04585004.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4585004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal design of switched beam antenna arrays using Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Directional antennas","Antenna arrays","Particle swarm optimization","Communication switching","Adaptive arrays","Mobile antennas","Mobile communication","Design methodology","Algorithm design and analysis","Particle beams"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4585004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Optimal design of switched beam antenna arrays using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4585004/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal design of switched beam antenna arrays using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"PID533268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105368S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4563629","isNumber":"4584476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4563629","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4584476","articleId":"4585004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ESAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4585006,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

The presented work is based on a soft minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) block linear equalizer (BLE) that exploits the banded structure of the frequency-domain channel matrix, as well as a receiver window that enforces this banded structure. This equalization approach allows us to implement the proposed designs with a complexity that is only linear in the number of subcarriers. Three block turbo equalizers are discussed: two are based on a biased MMSE criterion, while the third is based on the unbiased MMSE criterion. Simulation results show that the proposed iterative MMSE BLE achieves a better bit error rate (BER) performance than a previously proposed iterative MMSE serial linear equalizer (SLE). The proposed equalization algorithms are also tested in the presence of channel estimation errors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Block Turbo Equalization for OFDM Systems in Time-Varying Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.929129","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4652320/04585349.pdf","startPage":"5555","endPage":"5566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.929129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4652320","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4585349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4585349/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Block Turbo Equalization for OFDM Systems in Time-Varying Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4585349/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10265483","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Block Turbo Equalization for OFDM Systems in Time-Varying Channels","sourcePdf":"56tsp11-fang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081119S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4652320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4652320","articleId":"4585349","onlineDate":"01 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4585361,"authors":[{"name":"Sylvain Guilley","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement COMELEC, TELECOM Paris Tech, Paris"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4633723/4585361/4585361-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sylvain Guilley received a degree from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique (1997), a degree from the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (ENST) in 2002, the MS degree in quantum physics from the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure (ENS), and the PhD degree (summa cum laude) in 2007 from TELECOM ParisTech (formerly ENST), where his topic is on back-end countermeasures against side-channel attacks.

Recently, one vulnerability has been identified in a standard-cell-based power-constant logic called WDDL. Another logic, nicknamed SecLib, is considered and does not present the flaw of WDDL. In this paper, we evaluate the security level of WDDL and SecLib. The methodology consists in embedding in a dedicated circuit one unprotected DES coprocessor along with two others, implemented in WDDL and in SecLib. One essential part of this paper is to describe the conception of the cryptographic ASIC, devised to foster side-channel cryptanalyses, in a view to model the strongest possible attacker. The same analyses are carried out successively on the three DES modules. We conclude that, provided that the back-end of the WDDL module is carefully designed, its vulnerability cannot be exploited by the state-of-the-art attacks. Similarly, the SecLib DES module resists all assaults. However, using a principal component analysis, we show that WDDL is more vulnerable than SecLib. The statistical dispersion of WDDL, which reflects the correlation between the secrets and the power dissipation, is proved to be an order of magnitude higher than that of SecLib.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2008.109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4633723/04585361.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4633723","startPage":"1482","endPage":"1497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security Evaluation of WDDL and SecLib Countermeasures against Power Attacks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4585361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Security Evaluation of WDDL and SecLib Countermeasures against Power Attacks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4585361/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222548","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4585361/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security Evaluation of WDDL and SecLib Countermeasures against Power Attacks","sourcePdf":"ttc2008111482.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09756S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4633723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4633723","articleId":"4585361","onlineDate":"01 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4585363,"authors":[{"name":"Steve K.

In this paper we present a novel and practical IP traceback system called Flexible Deterministic Packet Marking (FDPM) which provides a defense system with the ability to find out the real sources of attacking packets that traverse through the network. While a number of other traceback schemes exist, FDPM provides innovative features to trace the source of IP packets and can obtain better tracing capability than others. In particular, FDPM adopts a flexible mark length strategy to make it compatible to different network environments; it also adaptively changes its marking rate according to the load of the participating router by a flexible flow-based marking scheme. Evaluations on both simulation and real system implementation demonstrate that FDPM requires a moderately small number of packets to complete the traceback process; add little additional load to routers and can trace a large number of sources in one traceback process with low false positive rates. The built-in overload prevention mechanism makes this system capable of achieving a satisfactory traceback result even when the router is heavily loaded. It has been used to not only trace DDoS attacking packets but also enhance filtering attacking traffic.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2008.132","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5074325/04585371.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2008.132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074325","startPage":"567","endPage":"580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible Deterministic Packet Marking: An IP Traceback System to Find the Real Source of Attacks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4585371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Flexible Deterministic Packet Marking: An IP Traceback System to Find the Real Source of Attacks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4585371/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704669","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4585371/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible Deterministic Packet Marking: An IP Traceback System to Find the Real Source of Attacks","sourcePdf":"ttd2009040567.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105582S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5074325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"5074325","articleId":"4585371","onlineDate":"01 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4585386,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios N.

In this paper, we propose a scheduling algorithm with dynamic priority assignment (DPA) which is designed for the downlink-shared channel (DSCH) of 3G WCDMA systems and operates within a cross layer framework. The DPA scheduler has low computational complexity and is able to provide QoS differentiation among traffic flows based on their delay sensitivity. Through the cross layer framework, DPA takes into account the variations of the wireless channel, and exploits processing gain to improve transmission quality and enable service provisioning when possible. Additionally, by providing a guaranteed rate per traffic flow at each scheduling period, DPA can offer a deterministic delay bound to each connection when transmissions are reliable. Stochastic delay guarantees under transmission power limitations are also provided when the traffic flows are identical. Simulation results show that DPA outperforms feasible earliest due date (FEDD), a variation of EDD for wireless environments.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2008.106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/4688934/04585386.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2008.106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4688934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scheduling Algorithm with Dynamic Priority Assignment for WCDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4585386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4585386/","displayDocTitle":"A Scheduling Algorithm with Dynamic Priority Assignment for WCDMA Systems","volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10324556","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4585386/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scheduling Algorithm with Dynamic Priority Assignment for WCDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"ttm2009010126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089777S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"4688934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4688934","articleId":"4585386","onlineDate":"01 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4585411,"authors":[{"name":"Rajesh Duggirala","affiliation":["Portland Technology Development, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/4585407/4585411/4585411-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rajesh Duggirala received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in 2007.","He is currently with Portland Technology Development, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR USA.

The effects of process induced intra-die Vt variations in 11 different dual-Vt cell combinations are evaluated and compared. In this work, N-curve metrics are adopted for the analysis as information about read stability and write ability can be obtained using a single curve. The statistical parameters like mean, standard deviation, average deviation for each of the metrics is found for all the 11 dual -Vt configurations using Monte-Carlo simulations. The effects of intra-die variations are considered as they are prominent at nanometer technologies. The comparisons are made with the help of power noise margins which are obtained by finding the product of mean of voltage noise margins and mean of current noise margins. The variances and percentage variances from the mean, of voltage and current margins for all combinations are tabulated and analyzed. Comparisons are also made based on rive different yield values. Thus given a range of a metric and the yield value one can choose the type of configuration of SRAM cell.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4585656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 March 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4585656/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10118476","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Read stability and write ability analysis of dual -Vt configurations of a single cell of an SRAM array effect of process-induced intra-die Vt variations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Read stability and write ability analysis of dual -Vt configurations of a single cell of an SRAM array effect of process-induced intra-die Vt variations","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"rp233-conf124a642-r512.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063902S","chronDate":"24-27 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4570840","isNumber":"4585424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4570840","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4585424","articleId":"4585656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4585708,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Haderer","affiliation":["Institute for Communications and Information Engineering, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Haderer","id":"37597677100"},{"name":"Christoph Wagner","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory for Integrated Radar Sensors, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Wagner","id":"37288717100"},{"name":"Reinhard Feger","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory for Integrated Radar Sensors, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Reinhard","lastName":"Feger","id":"37304277500"},{"name":"Andreas Stelzer","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory for Integrated Radar Sensors, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Stelzer","id":"37277223300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-83-7207-757-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5745"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5753"}],"articleNumber":"4585708","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":857},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","Sensors","Radar imaging","Field programmable gate arrays","Radar cross section","Digital signal processing","Synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CW radar","digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","FM radar","radar antennas","radar imaging","road vehicle radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FMCW prototype radar system","angular resolution","antenna array","digital signal processor","field programmable gate array","frequency modulated continuous wave","array processing application","synthetic aperture radar imaging","imaging area","automotive application","frequency 77 GHz"]}],"abstract":"Recent advances in the development of semiconductors allow the realization of low cost 77-GHz radar front-ends suitable for automotive applications. The requirements on the angular resolution often force designers to implement antenna arrays. In the last decade the trend moves towards digital array processing instead of analog beamforming because of the availability of cheap digital signal processors (DSP). In the case of an n-element receive array, the system must be capable of processing n receive channels in parallel resulting in a big amount of data. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) deliver the processing power and flexibility to handle the collected data and allow, in conjunction with a DSP, the implementation of sophisticated signal processing algorithms. This paper deals with the implementation of a 77-GHz frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) prototype radar system. The system is designed for use in array processing applications, with a maximum of eight parallel receive channels. The functionality of the prototype system is demonstrated in an imaging application. With the help of a portal axis the radar is moved along a synthetic aperture in order to reconstruct the reflectivity map of the imaging area.","publicationTitle":"2008 International Radar Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Radar Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4577717/4585695/04585708.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 77-GHz FMCW front-end with FPGA and DSP support","doi":"10.1109/IRS.2008.4585708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4585695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRS.2008.4585708","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4585708","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4585708/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"A 77-GHz FMCW front-end with FPGA and DSP support","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10153711","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4585708/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 77-GHz FMCW front-end with FPGA and DSP support","confLoc":"Wroclaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"01A01_Haderer.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048704S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577717","isNumber":"4585695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577717","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4585695","articleId":"4585708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Telecommunications Research Institute","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4585747,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Kawalec","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Institute of Radar Technology, Military University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Kawalec","id":"37284543800"},{"name":"Piotr Serafin","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Institute of Radar Technology, Military University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Serafin","id":"37705195800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-83-7207-757-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5745"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5753"}],"articleNumber":"4585747","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","Radar imaging","Spaceborne radar","Radar antennas","Synthetic aperture radar","Distance measurement","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","motion compensation","radar imaging","radar receivers","spaceborne radar","synthetic aperture radar","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel receiver application","platform motion compensation","synthetic aperture radar","SAR","high resolution radar images","spaceborne platform","carrier onboard sensors","inertial navigational systems","phase error estimation","autofocus techniques","channel signal","auxiliary receiving channels"]}],"abstract":"Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an advanced radar technique that provides high resolution radar images from an airborne or spaceborne platform. The quality of the radar image, however, is strongly affected by motion errors of the radar carrier. One of the ways to reduce those effects is to utilize information from carrier onboard sensors (inertial navigational systems - INS) to estimate phase errors and compute phase corrections for the processing algorithm. In order to improve the image quality and reduce the residual phase errors a variety of autofocus techniques is applied. Those are mainly based on estimating phase errors from one channel signal.

We show how to implement timing-based learning laws, such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), in simple, memristive nanodevices, such as those constructed from certain metal oxides. Such nano-scale ldquosynapsesrdquo can be combined with CMOS ldquoneuronsrdquo to create neuromorphic hardware several orders of magnitude denser than is possible in conventional CMOS. The key ideas are: (1) to factor out two synaptic state variables to pre- and post-synaptic neurons; and (2) to separate computational communication from learning by time-division multiplexing of pulse-width-modulated signals through synapses. This approach offers the advantages of: better control over power dissipation; fewer constraints on the design of memristive materials used for nanoscale synapses; learning dynamics can be dynamically turned on or off (e.g. by attentional priming mechanisms communicated extra-synaptically); greater control over the precise form and timing of the STDP equations; the ability to implement a variety of other learning laws besides STDP; better circuit diversity since the approach allows different learning laws to be implemented in different areas of a single chip using the same memristive material for all synapses.","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2008.4585796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4585784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2008.4585796","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","pdfPath":"/iel5/4577668/4585784/04585796.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"92","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spike-timing-dependent learning in memristive nanodevices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-13 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Spike-timing-dependent learning in memristive nanodevices","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4585796/","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153697","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4585796/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spike-timing-dependent learning in memristive nanodevices","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp12-108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087038S","chronDate":"12-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577668","isNumber":"4585784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577668","citationCount":"212","xplore-issue":"4585784","articleId":"4585796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4585797,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Liu","affiliation":["Lab of Nano-Fabrication and Novel Devices Integrated Technology, Institute of Microelevtronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ming Liu","id":"37401503300"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["College of Nanoscale Science Engineering, State University of New York, Albany, Albany, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Wei Wang","id":"37280460900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2552-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2553-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-8218"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-8226"}],"articleNumber":"4585797","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":572},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4585797","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Nanoscale devices","Field programmable gate arrays","Three dimensional displays","CMOS integrated circuits","Reconfigurable architectures","Electron devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","CMOS memory circuits","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","nanoelectronics","random-access storage","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS-nano hybrid FPGA","RRAM components","reconfigurable architectures","high-density resistive memory","baseline FPGA cell designs","rFPGA structures","3D architecture","2D architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","nanojunction","RRAM","3D integration"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, novel reconfigurable architectures are introduced to utilize high-density resistive memory (RRAM) to build FPGA components. Different from the existing CMOS-nano hybrid circuits that use crossbars, the proposed rFPGA structures consist of mainly 1T1R structures (1 CMOS transistor is integrated with a two-terminal resistive nanojunction) that can be fabricated using a CMOS-compatible process. The proposed 2D architecture maintains the baseline FPGA cell designs and significantly reduces the size of memory and routing elements using 1T1R structures. The proposed 3D architecture further improves the density of the 2D version by efficiently integrating RRAM and CMOS layers in three dimensions. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 2D and 3D FPGA structures can provide at least 2times-3times performance gains, compared to the corresponding 2D and 3D CMOS FPGA's.","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2008.4585797","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","pdfPath":"/iel5/4577668/4585784/04585797.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2008.4585797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4585784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"rFGA: CMOS-nano hybrid FPGA using RRAM components","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-13 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4585797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"rFGA: CMOS-nano hybrid FPGA using RRAM components","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4585797/","accessionNumber":"10153698","publicationDate":"June 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"rFGA: CMOS-nano hybrid FPGA using RRAM components","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp13-103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050876S","chronDate":"12-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577668","isNumber":"4585784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577668","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4585784","articleId":"4585797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4585879,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksey M.

The proposed SIDO DC-DC converter not only provides dual output sources (one buck and one boost outputs) but also has minimized cross regulation. Besides, a new hysteresis mode decided by a power decision circuit can effectively prevent SIDO converter from oscillating when power of buck is larger than that of boost. SIDO converter achieves high conversion efficiency at light loads. Experimental results show a high efficiency from 85% at light loads to 94% at heavy loads.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on VLSI Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4573021/4585928/04585980.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"133","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on VLSI Circuits","doi":"10.1109/VLSIC.2008.4585980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIC.2008.4585980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4585928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4585980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-inductor dual-output DC-DC converters with high light-load efficiency and minimized cross-regulation for portable devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Converters","Switches","Inductors","Current control","Hysteresis","Voltage control","Power conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak-current control single-inductor dual-output DC-DC converter","SIDO DC-DC converter","cross regulation","hysteresis mode","power decision circuit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4585980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Single-inductor dual-output DC-DC converters with high light-load efficiency and minimized cross-regulation for portable devices","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4585980/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153575","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-inductor dual-output DC-DC converters with high light-load efficiency and minimized cross-regulation for portable devices","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"14-1-248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086409S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4573021","isNumber":"4585928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4573021","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4585928","articleId":"4585980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4585983,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The proposed work describes an adaptive mechanism to generate a cell-Vdd (CVDD), which tracks a certain voltage offset with respect to logic-Vdd (VDD), and provides a mean to lower the VDD down to 0.6 V. To relax IR-drop constraints of CVDD power routings in P&R flow, shifting bite-line (BL) pre-charge power supply from CVDD to VDD is adopted in this work. This also avoids the congestion of the VDD and CVDD power mesh. A 45 nm test chip has demonstrated that these concepts successfully can push the VDD_min down to 0.6 V, which is > 250 mV lower than the conventional single-rail SRAMpsilas.","doi":"10.1109/VLSIC.2008.4586010","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on VLSI Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on VLSI Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4573021/4585928/04586010.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIC.2008.4586010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4585928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.6V 45nm adaptive dual-rail SRAM compiler circuit design for lower VDD_min VLSIs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A 0.6V 45nm adaptive dual-rail SRAM compiler circuit design for lower VDD_min VLSIs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10153605","htmlLink":"/document/4586010/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 0.6V 45nm adaptive dual-rail SRAM compiler circuit design for lower VDD_min VLSIs","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"21-3-280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046855S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4573021","isNumber":"4585928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4573021","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4585928","articleId":"4586010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4586011,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Using single-user (SU) MIMO as a baseline, we evaluate the system throughput performance of multiuser (MU) MIMO with generalized zero-forcing beamforming under a multiuser proportional fair scheduling metric. We consider network MIMO extensions of this technique by coordinating transmission among clusters of spatially distributed bases. By significantly mitigating intercell interference, network MIMO provides a tradeoff between improved performance and increased backhaul complexity that depends on the coordination cluster size. We describe a general technique for simulating cellular networks that is applicable to next-generation packet-based cellular standards, and we evaluate the performance of MU and network MIMO in heavily loaded networks. Compared to the SU MIMO baseline, median system throughput can be doubled by coordinating MU MIMO transmission among clusters of 3 adjacent cells.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4568415/4586016/04586045.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks and Workshops","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2008.4586045","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2008.4586045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586016","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of multiuser MIMO and network coordination in downlink cellular networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Downlink","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Transmitting antennas","Throughput","Wireless networks","Base stations","Array signal processing","Interference","Next generation networking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","cellular radio","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular networks","base stations","generalized zero-forcing beamforming","intercell interference","multiuser MIMO transmission","multiple input-multiple output system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586045/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance of multiuser MIMO and network coordination in downlink cellular networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586045/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10152939","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","conferenceDate":"1-3 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of multiuser MIMO and network coordination in downlink cellular networks","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"029 paper3191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086981S","chronDate":"1-3 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4568415","isNumber":"4586016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4568415","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4586016","articleId":"4586045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICSTIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4586048,"authors":[{"name":"Ari Hottinen","affiliation":["Nokia Group, Nokia Research Center, Finland"],"firstName":"Ari","lastName":"Hottinen","id":"37269045500"},{"name":"Emanuele Viterbo","affiliation":["D.E.I.S, Universit\u00e0 della Calabria, Arcavacata di Rende, Italy"],"firstName":"Emanuele","lastName":"Viterbo","id":"37284379900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-963-9799-18-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4586048","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":527},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Interference","Array signal processing","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Broadcasting","Processor scheduling","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink multiuser-MIMO transmission system","spatial channels","interuser interference","transmit precoding","linear programming algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity","Scheduling","beamforming","MIMO","assignment problem"]}],"abstract":"In this paper consider a downlink multiuser-MIMO transmission system in which at most two users can transmit simultaneously on different spatial channels or beams.

Designing an environmentally powered device faces several challenges: choosing the exact type of the energy harvester, the energy storage elements and determining the duty cycle of the application. With harvesting, the design process becomes even more difficult because it also has to take into account the unpredictability of the energy source. The contribution of this paper is a methodology that facilitates the analysis of energy harvesting nodes. The existing modeling strategies for battery powered systems are not suitable because they do not capture the uncertainty of the power source. Also, the metrics of interest for battery powered devices are different, as opposed to the harvesting powered ones: in the former case we search to maximize the system lifetime, while in the latter case a more expressive goal is to increase the system availability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586054/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10152945","publicationDate":"April 2008","conferenceDate":"1-3 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586054/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic modeling and analysis for environmentally powered wireless sensor nodes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic modeling and analysis for environmentally powered wireless sensor nodes","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"038 paper3179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090637S","chronDate":"1-3 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4568415","isNumber":"4586016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4568415","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4586016","articleId":"4586054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICSTIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4586065,"authors":[{"name":"Rohith Dwarakanath Vallam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Rohith Dwarakanath","lastName":"Vallam","id":"38253645500"},{"name":"A.

In addition, collusion between misbehaving nodes adds another dimension to this security problem. We examine this problem in a three-node network scenario wherein two nodes are assumed to be malicious colluding adversaries causing unfair channel access to the other legitimate node. The misbehaving nodes, through back-off manipulation, will try to minimize the channel access share got by the legitimate node and at the same time maximize the detection delay to detect such an attack. We explore this problem and its solution, analytically, in a non-saturated setting, by modelling a single IEEE 802.11 node as a discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) and suggest a measure for evaluating fairness in the network. We then propose an attacker-detector non-linear optimization model through which the joint optimal attacker distribution is evaluated by applying results from the area of variational calculus. We finally use the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) for estimating the average number of samples for detecting colluding adversaries in the network. We validate all the models using MATLAB and verify the model results by sampling values from the evaluated optimal attacker distribution using a robust statistical library called UNU.RAN.","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2008.4586065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586016","startPage":"197","endPage":"206","pdfPath":"/iel5/4568415/4586016/04586065.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks and Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks and Workshops","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2008.4586065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling co-operative MAC layer misbehaviour in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks with heterogeneous loads","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Mathematical model","Mobile ad hoc networks","Delay effects","Time measurement","Calculus","Probability","Sequential analysis","MATLAB","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","Markov processes","optimisation","probability","telecommunication security","variational techniques","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative MAC layer misbehaviour modelling","IEEE 802.11 wireless ad hoc network","heterogeneous load","unfair channel access","back-off manipulation","discrete time Markov chain","attacker-detector nonlinear optimization model","joint optimal attacker distribution","variational calculus","sequential probability ratio test","Matlab","malicious colluding adversary detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Modelling co-operative MAC layer misbehaviour in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks with heterogeneous loads","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586065/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586065/","accessionNumber":"10152954","publicationDate":"April 2008","conferenceDate":"1-3 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling co-operative MAC layer misbehaviour in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks with heterogeneous loads","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"049 paper3178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079884S","chronDate":"1-3 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4568415","isNumber":"4586016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4568415","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4586016","articleId":"4586065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICST","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4586066,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Tague","affiliation":["Network Security Lab (NSL), Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Tague","id":"37547773500"},{"name":"David Slater","affiliation":["Network Security Lab (NSL), Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Slater","id":"37867633400"},{"name":"Radha Poovendran","affiliation":["Network Security Lab (NSL), Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Radha","lastName":"Poovendran","id":"37276692700"},{"name":"Guevara Noubir","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Science, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Guevara","lastName":"Noubir","id":"37282492300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-963-9799-18-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4586066","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":341},"abstract":"We present a new class of network attacks, referred to as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">flow-jamming</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">attacks</i>\n, in which an adversary with multiple jammers throughout the network jams packets to reduce traffic flow.

The scenario in which a single cognitive user wishes to opportunistically exploit the availability of empty frequency bands within parts of the radio spectrum having multiple bands is first considered. In this scenario, the availability probability of each channel is unknown a priori to the cognitive user. Hence efficient medium access strategies must strike a balance between exploring (learning) the availability probability of the channels and exploiting the knowledge of the availability probability identified thus far. For this scenario, an optimal medium access strategy is derived and its underlying recursive structure is illustrated via examples. To avoid the prohibitive computational complexity of this optimal strategy, a low complexity asymptotically optimal strategy is developed. Next, the multi-cognitive user scenario is considered and low complexity medium access protocols, which strike an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation in such competitive environments, are developed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586086/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10152970","publicationDate":"April 2008","conferenceDate":"1-3 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586086/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal medium access protocols for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal medium access protocols for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"070 paper3180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099244S","chronDate":"1-3 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4568415","isNumber":"4586016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4568415","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4586016","articleId":"4586086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICST","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4586094,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Stanojev","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications and Signal Processing, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Stanojev","id":"37294254300"},{"name":"Osvaldo Simeone","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications and Signal Processing, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Osvaldo","lastName":"Simeone","id":"37269653500"},{"name":"Yeheskel Bar-Ness","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications and Signal Processing, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yeheskel","lastName":"Bar-Ness","id":"38272137900"},{"name":"Myeon-gyun Cho","affiliation":["Next Generation System Research Team, Telecommunication Research & Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myeon-gyun","lastName":"Cho","id":"37289900800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-963-9799-18-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4586094","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile ad hoc networks","Automatic repeat request","Delay","Spread spectrum communication","Wireless application protocol","Fading","Data communication","Routing","Decoding","Relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","automatic repeat request","protocols","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear wireless ad hoc networks","hybrid ARQ","Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest","quasi-static fading environment","data transmission","multihop routing","protocols","numerical optimization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the optimal design of a linear wireless multihop network that employs Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) protocols in a quasi-static fading environment. Data transmission is assumed to be delay-tolerant up to a certain predefined maximum delay (in transmission slots) that is larger or equal to the number of hops. Multihop routing is implemented through a time-division scheduling and decode-and-forward relaying. Excess time is exploited for retransmissions using either HARQ Type I or Chase Combining protocols on the hops that result in link-outage.

Unlike previous results, a simple coordination mechanism is used between selfish users. The nature and influence of the coordination mechanism is studied in details for single antenna and multiple antenna terminals. In the proposed framework, the coordination signal indicates to the users in which order the receiver applies successive interference cancelation and with which frequency this order is used: it establishes the rule of the game. Remarkably, in Gaussian single input single output MACs, it is shown that, whatever the rule of the game, the selfish behavior of the users leads to a socially efficient network that is to say it is always sum-capacity achieving. However, for fast fading MAC with multi-antenna terminals, there can be a performance gap between the decentralized system and its centralized counterpart. Analytical and simulation results are provided to assess this gap.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586118/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586118/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10152991","conferenceDate":"1-3 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized power allocation for coordinated multiple access channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized power allocation for coordinated multiple access channels","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"103 paper3213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053568S","chronDate":"1-3 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4568415","isNumber":"4586016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4568415","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4586016","articleId":"4586118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICST","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4586143,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto C.

The system offers a performance improvement of approximately 1 dB over systems without the outer iteration loop, and provides an information bit throughput that ranges from 60 to 300 megabits per second when a length 1944 rate 1/2 LDPC code is used.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4586295/04586298.pdf","startPage":"1003","endPage":"1014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Tradeoffs and Hardware Architecture for Real-Time Iterative MIMO Detection using Sphere Decoding and LDPC Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586298/","displayDocTitle":"Design Tradeoffs and Hardware Architecture for Real-Time Iterative MIMO Detection using Sphere Decoding and LDPC Coding","volume":"26","issue":"6","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10178020","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586298/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Tradeoffs and Hardware Architecture for Real-Time Iterative MIMO Detection using Sphere Decoding and LDPC Coding","sourcePdf":"0608jsac1003kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068243S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4586295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4586295","articleId":"4586298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":4586299,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Botros Shenouda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4586295/4586299/4586299-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Botros Shenouda received the B.Sc.

For systems with uplink-downlink reciprocity, we consider a stochastic model for the channel uncertainty, and we propose an efficient algorithm for the joint design of the linear preceding matrix at the base station and the equalizing gains at the receivers so as to minimize the average mean-square-error (MSE) over the channel uncertainty. The design is based on a generalization, derived herein, of the MSE duality between the broadcast and multiple access channels (MAC) to scenarios with uncertain CSI, and on a convex formulation for the design of robust transceivers for the dual MAC. For systems in which quantized channel feedback is employed, we consider a deterministically-bounded model for the channel uncertainty, and we study the design of robust downlink transceivers that minimize the worst- case MSE over all admissible channels. While we show that the design problem is NP-hard, we also propose an iterative local optimization algorithm that is based on efficiently-solvable convex conic formulations. Our framework is quite flexible, and can incorporate different bounded uncertainty models as well as a variety of power constraints. In particular, we study a \"system-wide\" uncertainty model, and although the resulting design problem is still NP hard, it does result in a significantly simpler iterative local design algorithm than the \"per-user\" uncertainty model. Our approaches to the minimax design for the downlink can be extended to the uplink, and we provide explicit formulations for the resulting uplink designs. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approaches to robust linear transceiver design can significantly reduce the sensitivity of the downlink to uncertain CSI, and can provide improved performance over that of existing robust designs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4586295/04586299.pdf","startPage":"1015","endPage":"1024","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586295","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Design of Linear Transceivers for Multiuser Systems with Channel Uncertainty","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Uncertainty","Downlink","Algorithm design and analysis","Robustness","Power system modeling","Iterative algorithms","Channel state information","Receiving antennas","Stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","broadcast channels","channel coding","computational complexity","linear predictive coding","matrix algebra","multi-access systems","optimisation","radio links","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear transceivers","multiuser systems","uncertain channel state information","uplink-downlink reciprocity","stochastic model","linear preceding matrix","mean-square-error","MSE","multiple access channels","broadcast channels","deterministically-bounded model","system-wide uncertainty model","NP hard problem","iterative local design algorithm","minimax design","linear transceiver design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586299/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the Design of Linear Transceivers for Multiuser Systems with Channel Uncertainty","volume":"26","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4586299/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10178021","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design of Linear Transceivers for Multiuser Systems with Channel Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"0608jsac1015shenouda.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082778S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4586295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"4586295","articleId":"4586299","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4586300,"authors":[{"name":"Nizar Zorba","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4586295/4586300/4586300-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nizar Zorba (Jordan, 1980) holds a BSc. in Electrical Engineering by JUST University (2002, Jordan), a MPhil in Mobile Communications by University of Zaragoza 2002\u20132004 Spain), a MPhil in Economics by University of Zaragoza 2003\u20132005 Spain), a MPhil in Signal Processing for Communications by Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya-UPC (2004\u20132006, Spain), and a PhD in Signal Processing for Communications by UPC 2004\u20132007 Spain).

The paper presents a power allocation over the transmitting beams, where a minimum rate per user restriction is required for each scheduled user, standing as a potential Quality of Service (QoS) indicator for the system behaviour. However, in practical wireless scenarios the CSIT is imperfect due to non-accurate estimation, so that robust schemes are required to meet the system demands. Based on the allowed system outage in the QoS achievement, different robust power allocation schemes are proposed, which are efficiently solved through convex optimization tools. The presented strategies are later compared via simulations for the different scenarios and the system specifications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4586295/04586300.pdf","startPage":"1025","endPage":"1034","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Power Allocation Schemes for Multibeam Opportunistic Transmission Strategies Under Quality of Service Constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","displayDocTitle":"Robust Power Allocation Schemes for Multibeam Opportunistic Transmission Strategies Under Quality of Service Constraints","volume":"26","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4586300/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10178022","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586300/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Power Allocation Schemes for Multibeam Opportunistic Transmission Strategies Under Quality of Service Constraints","sourcePdf":"0608jsac1025zorba.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069002S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4586295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4586295","articleId":"4586300","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":4586301,"authors":[{"name":"Mansoor Shafi","affiliation":["Telecom New Zealand, Wellington, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4586295/4586301/4586301-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mansoor Shafi received the B.

The required received signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) is less than 30dB, which is almost the upper limit in cellular environments near a cell site even with a light channel load, with the aim of application to future universal broadband packet radio access. We apply 12-by-12 MIMO multiplexing using the maximum likelihood detection employing QR decomposition and the M-algorithm (QRM-MLD) with adaptive selection of the surviving symbol replica candidates (ASESS),64QAM data modulation, and Turbo coding with the coding rate of R = 8/9 to achieve an extremely high frequency efficiency level. In the field experiments conducted in the Yokosuka Research Park (YRP) district of Yokosuka city, we show that the measured throughput of 4.92 Gbps is achieved at the average received SNR per receiver antenna of approximately 28.0 and 28.5 dB when the respective receiver antenna separation is 40 cm (6.2lambda) and 10 cm (1.5lambda) and the transmitter antenna separation is 70 cm (10.9lambda) at the average speed of 10 km/h under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field Experiments on MIMO Multiplexing with Peak Frequency Efficiency of 50 Bit/Second/Hz Using MLD Based Signal Detection for OFDM High-Speed Packet Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080802","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4586295/04586302.pdf","startPage":"845","endPage":"856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586295","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586302/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","displayDocTitle":"Field Experiments on MIMO Multiplexing with Peak Frequency Efficiency of 50 Bit/Second/Hz Using MLD Based Signal Detection for OFDM High-Speed Packet Access","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4586302/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10178023","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field Experiments on MIMO Multiplexing with Peak Frequency Efficiency of 50 Bit/Second/Hz Using MLD Based Signal Detection for OFDM High-Speed Packet Access","sourcePdf":"0608jsac845taoka.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087946S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4586295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4586295","articleId":"4586302","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4586303,"authors":[{"name":"Laurent Boher","affiliation":["RESA/WIN Department, Orange Laboratories, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"bio":{"p":["Laurent Boher received the Engineer degree from INSA Rennes, France, in 2005.

We start with a theoretical analysis under some ideal assumptions to derive the performance bounds of SDM-FDPS. To facilitate the analysis, a unified SINR concept is utilized to make a fair comparison of MIMO schemes with different number of spatial streams. The effect of packet scheduling is included in the post-scheduling SINR distribution using an analytical model. Based on that, the performance bounds are obtained with a more realistic SINR to throughput mapping metric. The system-level performance of SDM-FDPS has been evaluated under practical constraints using detailed simulations based on the UTRAN long term evolution (LTE) downlink cellular system framework. The purpose is to investigate the impact of realistic factors on performance. Results confirm that the combination of SDM and FDPS can increase the spectral efficiency significantly, particularly in a micro-cell scenario, and up to 30%-60% gain is observed over 1times2 with FDPS depending on the traffic models considered. Finally, the more practical simulation results are compared against the theoretical performance bounds. A performance loss is seen in the simulations due to realistic coding/modulation, impact of frequency selectivity, signalling constraints, imperfect channel quality indicator (CQI), etc.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586306","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Frequency domain analysis","Scheduling algorithm","Signal to noise ratio","Performance analysis","Analytical models","Throughput","Long Term Evolution","Downlink","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","MIMO communication","multiplexing","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial division multiplexing MIMO","frequency domain packet scheduling","multiple-input multiple-output techniques","theoretical analysis","long term evolution downlink cellular system framework","spectral efficiency","channel quality indicator","frequency selectivity","signal to interference noise ratio"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4586295/04586306.pdf","startPage":"890","endPage":"900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080806","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Spatial Division Multiplexing MIMO with Frequency Domain Packet Scheduling: From Theory to Practice","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586306/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Spatial Division Multiplexing MIMO with Frequency Domain Packet Scheduling: From Theory to Practice","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10178027","htmlLink":"/document/4586306/","volume":"26","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Spatial Division Multiplexing MIMO with Frequency Domain Packet Scheduling: From Theory to Practice","sourcePdf":"0608jsac890wei.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095264S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4586295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4586295","articleId":"4586306","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4586307,"authors":[{"name":"Brad W.

The performance of the estimator is contingent upon TSs short enough to ensure convexity of the log-likelihood over the allowable CFO ranges.

The communication channels in multi base-station signaling differ from those involving collocated transmit-antenna systems, and, if properly used, can provide improved resistance to shadowing and extended range. One challenge, however, that arises in this context is asynchronous reception of the signal elements. In the narrowband case the proposed designs generate asynchrony robust space-time block codes (STBCs) via transformations of existing orthogonal STBCs. Subject to a maximum allowable relative delay between signals from distinct transmit antennas, the resulting received signal can be equivalently modeled as arising from synchronous STBC transmission with orthogonal or diagonal STBCs, implying that these designs provide full space diversity with low-complexity decoding in asynchronous settings. We also describe three system approaches for wideband transmission with throughput diversity receiver-complexity trade-offs. Common to all these systems are elements such as OFDM- type signaling, bit-interleaved coded modulation, and iterative decoding. The lowest data-rate lowest complexity system employs an inner orthogonal space-time block code with embedded OFDM-type transmission, while the highest data-rate highest complexity scheme does not employ an inner code. The latter group of schemes can also conveniently provide high data rates at the cost of reduced space diversity. All schemes can be readily extended to provide flexible unequal error protection for media transport.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4586295/04586309.pdf","startPage":"927","endPage":"937","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586295","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-Time Codes for MIMO Systems with Non-Collocated Transmit Antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space time codes","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Narrowband","Wideband","Block codes","Iterative decoding","Downlink","Base stations","Communication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","interleaved codes","MIMO communication","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time codes","MIMO systems","non-collocated transmit antennas","cooperative narrowband","wideband downlink transmission","block codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Space-Time Codes for MIMO Systems with Non-Collocated Transmit Antennas","volume":"26","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4586309/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10178030","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time Codes for MIMO Systems with Non-Collocated Transmit Antennas","sourcePdf":"0608jsac927papadopou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107513S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4586295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4586295","articleId":"4586309","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4586310,"authors":[{"name":"Chadi Abou-Rjeily","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lebanese American University, Byblos, Lebanon"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4586295/4586310/4586310-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chadi Abou-Rjeily is an assistant professor at the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the Lebanese American University (LAU), Byblos, Lebanon.

While all the existing ST block codes necessitate rotating the phase or amplifying the amplitude of the transmitted symbols, the proposed scheme can be associated with unipolar PPM constellations without introducing any additional constellation extension. In other words, full transmit diversity can be achieved while conveying the information only through the time delays of the modulated signals transmitted from the different antennas. The absence of phase rotations renders the proposed scheme convenient for low- cost carrier-less multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) time- hopping ultra-wideband (TH-UWB) systems and for MIMO free-space optical (FSO) communications with direct detection. In particular, we propose two families of minimal-delay ST block codes that achieve a full transmit diversity order with PPM. Designate by n the number of transmit antennas and by M the number of modulation positions. For a given set of values of (n, m), the first family of codes achieves a rate of 1 symbol per channel use (PCU) which is the highest possible achievable rate when no constellation extensions are introduced. The second family of codes can be applied with a wider range of (n, m) at the expense of a reduced rate given by: R=1/n+n-1/n log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n(M-1)/n log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n(M).","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080810","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4586295/04586310.pdf","startPage":"938","endPage":"947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-Time Codes for MIMO Ultra-Wideband Communications and MIMO Free-Space Optical Communications with PPM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586310/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","displayDocTitle":"Space-Time Codes for MIMO Ultra-Wideband Communications and MIMO Free-Space Optical Communications with PPM","volume":"26","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10178031","htmlLink":"/document/4586310/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time Codes for MIMO Ultra-Wideband Communications and MIMO Free-Space Optical Communications with PPM","sourcePdf":"0608jsac938abou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082213S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4586295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4586295","articleId":"4586310","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4586311,"authors":[{"name":"Cong Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4586295/4586311/4586311-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cong Shen (S'01) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees, in 2002 and 2004 respectively, from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

A beamforming method is proposed which helps improve the receiver channel estimation performance without degrading any benefit of a conventional beamformer. To that end, the smoothed singular value decomposition (SSVD) algorithm is first developed to get \"close\" effective channels after beamforming for two adjacent subcarriers. Based on the SSVD algorithm, the frequency smoothed beamformer (FSB) design is then derived, in which smooth effective channels across all subcarriers are generated and thus the receiver can apply interpolation and smoothing to improve the channel estimation performance. The close singular value problem is discussed. Statistical characteristics of the effective channel are analyzed, which is used to design channel estimation for the beamformed channel.

These techniques are used to overcome multipath fading and/or improve the peak throughput of wireless systems. It is well known that there is a fundamental tradeoff between diversity gain and multiplexing gain [1]. Orthogonal space time codes such as the Alamouti code (also known as space time block codes (STBC)) exploit multiple antennas as a diversity source, and thus improve packet error rate (PER) and the average throughput. However, space time block codes are not designed to increase the peak data rate of the system. On the other hand, spatial multiplexing (SM) techniques offer higher peak throughput by transmitting parallel streams of data from different antennas. In order to successfully decode the parallel streams, the channel must exhibit a small eigenvalue spread. Otherwise, the streams will interfere with one another and it is difficult to decode the information data. The performance improvement from SM is therefore highly dependent on the channel characteristics. It is possible to use multiple encoders and rate control per layer to improve the SM performance. However, there are instances of channel where STBC is more beneficial than SM with a single encoder. In order to resolve the shortcomings of STBC and SM, a hybrid technique can be applied where depending on the instantaneous channel conditions either STBC or SM is selected. This technique is commonly referred to as adaptive MIMO switching (AMS) [5]-[11]. One important aspect of the technique is the switching criteria, namely the PHY abstraction method which estimates a packet error event as a function of the instantaneous channel condition, transmission profiles, and receiver characteristics. We show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other techniques such as determinant and Demmel condition number based techniques in flat fading channel. In selective fading channels where a codeword sees a finite number of multiple channel qualities, estimating the resulting PER is very challenging. Existing techniques rely on an estimate of the average of the channel qualities seen by each codeword. In this paper, we propose a PHY abstraction and switching algorithm hereby referred to by weighted sum of instantaneous qualities (WSIQ) whereby the channel qualities are ordered in order to reduce the variance of channel qualities and then a weighted sum of the qualities is applied. The weighting vector is chosen to minimize the variance of the linear sum. We have provided simulations to show the superiority of WSIQ even when channel statistics are unknown. In addition, computationally efficient techniques suited for practical implementation are proposed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Pragmatic PHY Abstraction Technique for Link Adaptation and MIMO Switching","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080812","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4586295/04586312.pdf","startPage":"960","endPage":"971","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586295","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586312/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Pragmatic PHY Abstraction Technique for Link Adaptation and MIMO Switching","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4586312/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10178033","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Pragmatic PHY Abstraction Technique for Link Adaptation and MIMO Switching","sourcePdf":"0608jsac960choi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064194S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4586295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4586295","articleId":"4586312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4586313,"authors":[{"name":"Antonis Kalis","affiliation":["Athens Information Technology Center, Paiania, Attica, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4586295/4586313/4586313-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonis Kalis is an associate professor of AIT and an adjunct professor of Carnegie Mellon University.

Using this approach we show that we can increase the capacity of wireless communication systems using compact parasitic antenna architectures and a single RF front end at the transmitter, thus paving the way for integrating MIMO systems in cost and size sensitive wireless devices such as mobile terminals and mobile personal digital assistants.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080813","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4586295/04586313.pdf","startPage":"972","endPage":"980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Approach to MIMO Transmission Using a Single RF Front End","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586313/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach to MIMO Transmission Using a Single RF Front End","volume":"26","issue":"6","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10178034","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586313/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach to MIMO Transmission Using a Single RF Front End","sourcePdf":"0608jsac972kalis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060771S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4586295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"4586295","articleId":"4586313","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4586314,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Ali Khojastepour","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4586295/4586314/4586314-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Ali (Amir) Khojastepour (S'02-M'05) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, in 1993 and 1996, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Rice University, Houston, TX, in 2004.

Linear MIMO detection, such as zero-forcing or minimum mean squared error (MMSE) equalization, is basically a channel diagonalization technique, where interferences from other data streams are decoupled for the separate decoding. It is well known, however, that such decoders suffer from noise enhancement, which causes considerable performance degradation. In this paper, we propose poly-diagonalization of the channel matrix in zero-forcing and MMSE senses. The idea behind poly-diagonalization is to allow interferences partially in order to alleviate the noise enhancement and, then, to use post trellis decoding for the joint detection utilizing the poly-diagonal structure of the effective channel. Under the proposed framework, the zero-forcing and the MMSE equalizer can be regarded as special cases of poly-diagonalization, i.e., of the first order. The proposed scheme can provide a tradeoff between the complexity and performance by choosing an appropriate order of poly-diagonalization. According to the simulation results, considerable gain can be obtained even with the second order, i.e., bi-diagonalization, for which the decoding complexity is far less than that of the maximum likelihood decoding.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4586295/04586315.pdf","startPage":"993","endPage":"1002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Detection Algorithm for Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Transmission using Poly-Diagonalization and Trellis Decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586315","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586315/","displayDocTitle":"A Detection Algorithm for Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Transmission using Poly-Diagonalization and Trellis Decoding","volume":"26","issue":"6","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10178036","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586315/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Detection Algorithm for Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Transmission using Poly-Diagonalization and Trellis Decoding","sourcePdf":"0608jsac993yoon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069562S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4586295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4586295","articleId":"4586315","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4586326,"authors":[{"name":"Anh Nguyen-Xuan","affiliation":["Laboratoire Cognitions Humaine et Artificielle, Universite Paris, Saint Denis, France"],"bio":{"p":["A.

By appropriately representing each biological dataset as a kernel matrix then combining them in solving problems, the kernel-based approach has become a spotlight in data integration and its application in bioinformatics and other fields as well. While linear combination of unweighed multiple kernels (UMK) is popular, there have been effort on multiple kernel learning (MKL) where optimal weights are learned by semi-definite programming or sequential minimal optimization (SMO-MKL). These methods provide high accuracy of biological prediction problems, but very complicated and hard to use, especially for non-experts in optimization. These methods are also usually of high computational cost and not suitable for large data sets. In this paper, we propose two simple but effective methods for determining weights for conic combination of multiple kernels. The former is to learn optimal weights formulated by our measure FSM for kernel matrix evaluation (feature space-based kernel matrix evaluation measure), denoted by FSM-MKL. The latter assigns a weight to each kernel that is proportional to the quality of the kernel, determining by direct cross validation, named proportionally weighted multiple kernels (PWMK). Experimental comparative evaluation of the four methods UMK, SMO-MKL, FSM-MKL and PWMK for the problem of protein-protein interactions shows that our proposed methods are simpler, more efficient but still effective. They achieved performances almost as high as that of MKL and higher than that of UMK.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Research, Innovation and Vision for the Future in Computing and Communication Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Research, Innovation and Vision for the Future in Computing and Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586318/4586319/04586335.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"78","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple but effective methods for combining kernels in computational biology","doi":"10.1109/RIVF.2008.4586335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RIVF.2008.4586335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Simple but effective methods for combining kernels in computational biology","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156850","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-17 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4586335/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple but effective methods for combining kernels in computational biology","confLoc":"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"a11-71-78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075963S","chronDate":"13-17 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586318","isNumber":"4586319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586318","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4586319","articleId":"4586335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":4586337,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-San Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-San Yang","id":"37087393498"},{"name":"Li-Yeh Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Chemical Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Yeh","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37304564000"},{"name":"Chao-Hsuan Ke","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chao-Hsuan Ke","id":"37087392942"},{"name":"Cheng-Hong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Hong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279099500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4586337","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comparative particle swarm optimization","stochastic intelligence search algorithm","population-based intelligence search algorithm","premature convergence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Swarm intelligence","Comparative"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586337","abstract":"Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a stochastic and population-based intelligence search algorithm, which has been demonstrated to solve optimization problem effectively. However, as the particle properties become increasingly similar after several generations, the particles tend to cluster around the best (fittest) particle in the swarm, which results in premature convergence of the PSO algorithm. In other words, the particles get trapped in the local optimal solution. In this paper, a new conception of PSO is proposed, which is based on comparing the experience of all particles in the swarm to generate a better position, and guide all particles toward the best possible solution. Experiments conducted on three benchmark functions show that the new algorithm is more efficient than standard PSO.","doi":"10.1109/RIVF.2008.4586337","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586318/4586319/04586337.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"90","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Research, Innovation and Vision for the Future in Computing and Communication Technologies","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Research, Innovation and Vision for the Future in Computing and Communication Technologies","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RIVF.2008.4586337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO) for solving optimization problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Comparative Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO) for solving optimization problems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10156852","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4586337/","conferenceDate":"13-17 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO) for solving optimization problems","confLoc":"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"a13-86-90.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055065S","chronDate":"13-17 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586318","isNumber":"4586319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586318","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4586319","articleId":"4586337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4586343,"authors":[{"name":"Vu Hoang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, University of Science, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Vu","lastName":"Hoang","id":"38086773300"},{"name":"Mai Ngo","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, University of Science, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Mai","lastName":"Ngo","id":"38081866000"},{"name":"Dien Dinh","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, University of Science, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Dien","lastName":"Dinh","id":"37699509500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4586343","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational linguistics","grammars","language translation","natural language processing","trees (mathematics)","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dependency-based word reordering approach","statistical machine translation","statistical parser","linguistic hand-crafted rules","parse tree","English language","Vietnamese language","syntactic differences","VCLEVC corpus","MOSES phrase-based baseline system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Natural language processing","statistical machine translation","preprocessing","word reordering","transformation","dependency parser"]}],"abstract":"Reordering is of crucial importance for machine translation. Solving the reordering problem can lead to remarkable improvements in translation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solve the word reordering problem in statistical machine translation. We rely on the dependency relations retrieved from a statistical parser incorporating with linguistic hand-crafted rules to create the transformations. These dependency-based transformations can produce the problem of word movement on both phrase and word reordering which is a difficult problem on parse tree based approaches. Such transformations are then applied as a preprocessor to English language both in training and decoding process to obtain an underlying word order closer to the Vietnamese language. About the hand-crafted rules, we extract from the syntactic differences of word order between English and Vietnamese language. This approach is simple and easy to implement with a small rule set, not lead to the rule explosion. We describe the experiments using our model on VCLEVC corpus [18] and consider the translation from English to Vietnamese, showing significant improvements about 2-4% BLEU score in comparison with the MOSES phrase-based baseline system [19].","doi":"10.1109/RIVF.2008.4586343","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Research, Innovation and Vision for the Future in Computing and Communication Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Research, Innovation and Vision for the Future in Computing and Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586318/4586319/04586343.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RIVF.2008.4586343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586319","startPage":"120","endPage":"127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dependency-based word reordering approach for Statistical Machine Translation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A dependency-based word reordering approach for Statistical Machine Translation","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586343/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-17 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156858","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4586343/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dependency-based word reordering approach for Statistical Machine Translation","confLoc":"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"a19-120-127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067223S","chronDate":"13-17 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586318","isNumber":"4586319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586318","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4586319","articleId":"4586343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4586344,"authors":[{"name":"Minh Nghiem","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, University of Sciences, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Minh","lastName":"Nghiem","id":"38093927600"},{"name":"Dien Dinh","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, University of Sciences, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Dien","lastName":"Dinh","id":"37699509500"},{"name":"Mai Nguyen","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of Information and Technology, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Mai","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38097140000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4586344","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","speech processing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rich feature set","support vector machines","part of speech tagging","natural language processing","Vietnamese language","language specific features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Natural Language Processing","Part of Speech Tagging","Support Vector Machines"]}],"abstract":"Part of speech (POS) tagging is fundamental in natural language processing.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to behavioral distance measurement using a new type of hidden Markov model, and present an architecture realizing this new approach. We evaluate the detection capability of this approach using synthetic workloads and recorded workloads of production Web and game servers, and show that it detects intrusions with substantially greater accuracy than a prior proposal on measuring behavioral distance. We also detail the design and implementation of a new architecture, which takes advantage of virtualization to measure behavioral distance. We apply our architecture to implement intrusion-tolerant Web and game servers, and through trace-driven simulations demonstrate that it experiences moderate performance costs even when thresholds are set to detect stealthy mimicry attacks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beyond Output Voting: Detecting Compromised Replicas Using HMM-Based Behavioral Distance","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2008.39","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/4912722/04586395.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2008.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912722","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Beyond Output Voting: Detecting Compromised Replicas Using HMM-Based Behavioral Distance","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4586395/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","publicationDate":"April-June 2009","accessionNumber":"10630564","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond Output Voting: Detecting Compromised Replicas Using HMM-Based Behavioral Distance","sourcePdf":"ttq2009020096.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098363S","chronDate":"April-June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"4912722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4912722","articleId":"4586395","onlineDate":"01 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4586400,"authors":[{"name":"Geert Eneman","affiliation":["Fund for Scientific Research of Flanders, Brussels, Belgium","Inter University Micro Electronics Center, Leuven, Belgium","Electrical Engineering Department, INSYS Division, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4603161/4586400/4586400-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Geert Eneman received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree on the topic of \u201cdesign, fabrication, and characterization of strained silicon transistors\u201d from the Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, in 1999, 2002, and 2006, respectively.

Use of a halo-implant condition optimized for our 125-nm gate-length pMOS devices shows less than one decade higher area leakage than the optimal p+/n junction. For even higher doping levels, the leakage density increases strongly. Therefore, careful optimization of p+/n junctions is needed for decananometer germanium transistors. The junction leakage shows good agreement with electrical simulations, although for some implant conditions, more adequate implant models are required. Finally, it is shown that the area-junction static-power consumption for the best junctions remains below the power-density specifications for high-performance applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Donor Concentration, Electric Field, and Temperature Effects on the Leakage Current in Germanium p -n Junctions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2008.927660","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4603161/04586400.pdf","startPage":"2287","endPage":"2296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2008.927660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586400","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586400/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Donor Concentration, Electric Field, and Temperature Effects on the Leakage Current in Germanium p <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$+/$</tex></formula>n Junctions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4586400/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10177309","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Donor Concentration, Electric Field, and Temperature Effects on the Leakage Current in Germanium p <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$+/$</tex></formula>n Junctions","sourcePdf":"55ted09-eneman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107007S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4603161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"4603161","articleId":"4586400","onlineDate":"04 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":4586401,"authors":[{"name":"Albert J.

The EMI in a network switch and a network router are investigated by means of sources-device models developed for each one of the devices. These models are based on data obtained from magnetic probe measurements in various types of network equipment. Finally, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized to indicate the optimal arrangement of ICs that results in significant reduction of the electric current density induced on the metallic walls.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586416/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10158578","htmlLink":"/document/4586416/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"EMI Reduction and ICs Optimal Arrangement Inside High-Speed Networking Equipment Using Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EMI Reduction and ICs Optimal Arrangement Inside High-Speed Networking Equipment Using Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"50temc03-goudos-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056067S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"4603115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4603115","articleId":"4586416","onlineDate":"04 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4586431,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Luo","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4616565/4586431/4586431-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bin Luo (M'01) received the B.Eng degree in electrical engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 1989, and the M.Sc degree in electrical engineering from the University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2003.","He is currently a Senior Research Officer with the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), A-STAR, Singapore.

In particular, the amount of information to be downloaded from the roadside-deployed gateways is dramatically increasing. Infected by high mobility, intermittent connectivity, and unreliability of the wireless channel, it is challenging to satisfy the need for massive data transmission in vehicular networks. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol called vehicular cooperative media access control (VC-MAC), which utilizes the concept of cooperative communication tailored for vehicular networks, particularly for gateway-downloading scenarios. VC-MAC leverages the broadcast nature of the wireless medium to maximize the system throughput. Spatial diversity and user diversity are exploited by concurrent cooperative relaying to overcome the unreliability of the wireless channel in vehicular networks. We theoretically analyze the selection of an optimal relay set using a weighted independent set (WIS) model and then design a backoff mechanism to select the optimal relays in a distributed manner. We have carried out extensive simulations to demonstrate that VC-MAC effectively enhances cooperative information downloading and significantly increases the system throughput compared with existing strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.929219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4802057/04586435.pdf","startPage":"1561","endPage":"1571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.929219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4802057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VC-MAC: A Cooperative MAC Protocol in Vehicular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586435/","displayDocTitle":"VC-MAC: A Cooperative MAC Protocol in Vehicular Networks","volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10520137","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586435/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VC-MAC: A Cooperative MAC Protocol in Vehicular Networks","sourcePdf":"58tvt03-jzhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090408S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4802057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"4802057","articleId":"4586435","onlineDate":"04 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":4586436,"authors":[{"name":"SeungHwan Won","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4802057/4586436/4586436-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["SeungHwan Won (M'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in radio science and engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 1999 and 2001, respectively.

And the computational experiments show that the performance of this approach is excellent based on a comparison with previous results.","doi":"10.1109/TR.2008.927807","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/4610050/04586437.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2008.927807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Redundancy Allocation for Series-Parallel Systems Using Integer Linear Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586437/","displayDocTitle":"Redundancy Allocation for Series-Parallel Systems Using Integer Linear Programming","volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185411","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586437/","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Redundancy Allocation for Series-Parallel Systems Using Integer Linear Programming","sourcePdf":"57tr03-billionnet.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078691S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"4610050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4610050","articleId":"4586437","onlineDate":"04 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":4586520,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo V.

The controller regulates the inverter terminal voltage and the active power delivered to the AC system, and takes into account the phase-locked loop (PLL) dynamics. An example, in which two SOFC plants provide power to a microgrid, explores controller behaviour. The investigation considers disconnection from the main grid, autonomous operation, and re-synchronization with the main grid.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04586555.pdf","startPage":"586","endPage":"590","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4586555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4586555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of inverter-connected sources in autonomous microgrids","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Phase locked loops","Fuel cells","Distributed control","Communication system control","Power system dynamics","Power system reliability","Voltage control","Frequency synchronization","Vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","fuel cell power plants","invertors","phase locked loops","power control","power generation control","power generation reliability","power system interconnection","solid oxide fuel cells","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverter-connected sources","autonomous microgrids","distributed generation","grid connection","terminal voltage","active power","phase-locked dynamics","SOFC plants"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microgrid dynamics","inverter control","phase locked loops"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Control of inverter-connected sources in autonomous microgrids","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586555/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10067991","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of inverter-connected sources in autonomous microgrids","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"100_1257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111163S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4586555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4586560,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Liu","affiliation":["Cardinal Health, Inc., Yorba Linda, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yong Liu","id":"37087154766"},{"name":"J.

Upon target detection, a trajectory corresponding to the nearest nominal target location is selected and dimensionalized. An onboard waypoint-navigating controller follows the waypoints. Thus, trajectory generation occurs in near-constant time, which allows for fast adaptation as the target state estimate is refined. Parameterization of the trajectories with respect to relative vehicle speed, sensor range, and sensor update rate allows the same table to be used for various combinations of sensor package and vehicle or vehicle operating conditions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04586570.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4586570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4586570","startPage":"672","endPage":"677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameterized trajectories for target localization using small and micro unmanned aerial vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586570/","displayDocTitle":"Parameterized trajectories for target localization using small and micro unmanned aerial vehicles","htmlLink":"/document/4586570/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10067803","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameterized trajectories for target localization using small and micro unmanned aerial vehicles","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"115_0944.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072451S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4586570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACCIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4586577,"authors":[{"name":"Dario Bauso","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica-DINFO, Universit\u00e0 di Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Dario","lastName":"Bauso","id":"37268237300"},{"name":"Raffaele Pesenti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Matematica Applicata-DMA, Universit\u00e0 di Venezia, Venezia, Italy"],"firstName":"Raffaele","lastName":"Pesenti","id":"37299041400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2078-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2079-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"4586577","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Control systems","Convergence","Sufficient conditions","Costs","Switches","Application software","Distributed computing","Finance","Logistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean algebra","decision making","decision theory","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized person-by-person optimization","team problems","binary decision spaces","pseudo-boolean optimization field","polynomial time"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586577","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4586577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4586577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04586577.pdf","startPage":"717","endPage":"722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized person-by-person optimization in team problems with binary decisions","abstract":"In this paper, we extend the notion of person by person optimization to binary decision spaces.

We also generalize the concept of pbp optimization to the case where the decision makers (DMs) make decisions sequentially in groups of m, we call it mbm optimization. The main contribution are certain sufficient conditions, verifiable in polynomial time, under which a pbp or an mbm optimization algorithm leads to the team-optimum. We also show that there exists a subclass of sub-modular team problems, recognizable in polynomial time, for which the convergence is guaranteed if the pbp algorithm is opportunely initialized.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4586577/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10067419","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Generalized person-by-person optimization in team problems with binary decisions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized person-by-person optimization in team problems with binary decisions","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"122_0283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064905S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4586577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEAACC","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4586628,"authors":[{"name":"Supakorn Mudchanatongsuk","affiliation":["Department of Management Science and Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Supakorn","lastName":"Mudchanatongsuk","id":"38096394100"},{"name":"James A.

Then, it is important to derive a good approximate sampled-data model because the exact sampled- data model for nonlinear systems is often unavailable to the controller designers. Recently, Yuz and Goodwin have proposed an accurate sampled-data model which includes extra zero dynamics, so-called the sampling zero dynamics, corresponding to the relative degree of the continuous-time nonlinear system. This paper shows that a more accurate sampled-data model is required for a controlled Van der Pol system with the relative degree two. The reason is that the closed-loop system becomes unstable when a controller design method based on cancellation of the zero dynamics is applied, and the phenomenon seems related to the instability of the sampling zero dynamics of the more accurate sampled-data model. Further, this paper derives a more accurate model than that of Yuz and Goodwin for continuous-time nonlinear systems with the relative degree two, and presents a condition which assures the stability of the sampling zero dynamics of the obtained model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4586653/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10067487","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Zero dynamics of sampled-data models for nonlinear systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero dynamics of sampled-data models for nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"198_0433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048123S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4586653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4586658,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Distributed data fusion provides a framework for multiple sensors to search for a target and accurately estimate its position. Vision based sensing is employed, using fixed downward-looking cameras. These sensors are modeled to include vehicle state uncertainty and produce an estimate update regardless of whether the target is detected in the frame or not. This allows for a single framework for searching or tracking, and requires non-linear representations of the target position probability density function (PDF) and the sensor model. While a grid-based system for Bayesian estimation was used for the flight demonstrations, the use of a particle filter solution has also been examined. Multi-aircraft flight experiments demonstrate vision-based localization of a stationary target with estimated error co- variance on the order of meters. This capability for real-time distributed estimation will be a necessary component for future research in information-theoretic control.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4586784","startPage":"1985","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04586784.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4586784","endPage":"1990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiple UAV system for vision-based search and localization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A multiple UAV system for vision-based search and localization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586784/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10067452","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiple UAV system for vision-based search and localization","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"329_0376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072426S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4586784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4586785,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew T.

These active energy-based sensors collect information about objects of interest at rates that depend on the range to the objects according to Shannon's channel capacity equation, where the signal-to-noise ratio is governed by the radar equation. The mission of the UAVs is to travel through a given area and collect a specified amount of information about each object of interest while minimizing the total mission time. This information can then be used to classify the objects of interest. An optimal path planning problem is formulated where the states are the Cartesian coordinates of the UAVs and the amounts of information collected about each object of interest, the control inputs are the UAV heading angles, the objective function is the total mission time, and the boundary conditions are subject to inequality constraints that reflect the requirements of information collection. Necessary conditions for optimality are given, whose solutions yield extremal paths, and whose utilization highlights analytical properties of these extremal paths. The problem exhibits several limiting regimes, including the so-called Watchtower and the Multi-Vehicle Traveling Salesman Problem. These results are illustrated on several time-optimal cooperative exploration scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04586785.pdf","startPage":"1991","endPage":"1996","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4586785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4586785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path planning for cooperative time-optimal information collection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Equations","Capacitive sensors","Channel capacity","Signal to noise ratio","Radar","Optimal control","Boundary conditions","Traveling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","mobile robots","optimal control","path planning","remotely operated vehicles","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative time-optimal information collection","level flight path planning","constant velocity","unmanned air vehicle","omni directional sensor","Shannon channel capacity equation","radar equation","Cartesian coordinate","multi vehicle traveling salesman problem","active energy-based sensor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Path planning for cooperative time-optimal information collection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586785/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10067612","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path planning for cooperative time-optimal information collection","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"330_0618.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0552S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4586785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4586791,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew J.

Charge drives can reduce hysteresis to less than 1% of the scan range. This results in a corresponding increase in bandwidth and reduction of sensor induced noise. In this work we review the design of charge drives and compare them to voltage amplifiers for driving lateral SPM scanners. The first experimental images using charge drive are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586791/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10067533","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4586791/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of charge drives for scanning probe microscope positioning stages","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of charge drives for scanning probe microscope positioning stages","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"336_0498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041346S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4586791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACCIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4586851,"authors":[{"name":"Ajay Deshpande","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ajay","lastName":"Deshpande","id":"37405479600"},{"name":"Sanjay E.

We ask when and where it is best to sample an unknown scalar field (say of temperatures or chemical concentrations) in order to estimate it to within a certain error tolerance. This question is necessary to decide where to place sensors in sensing phenomena which can be described as fields over large areas. We assume that the field is modeled as a linear combination of a set of basis functions and that the sensor measurements are noisy. Based on linear estimation theory, estimation error can be shown to be a function of sampling errors and of the geometric arrangement of sampling locations. We refer to the latter as the sensor arrangement. Our approach is to characterize different classes of sensor arrangements and to understand the circumstances under which the reconstructed fields for arrangements from these classes satisfy an error tolerance limit. We refer to these classes as error tolerant arrangement classes or ETAC's. With a knowledge of the nature of ETAC's we will have articulated constraints for placing sensors in time and space; furthermore, by identifying possible sampling locations in advance, we will also have simplified the planning of the motion of mobile sensors for that field. In this paper we discuss three types of ETAC's for fields that are modeled as 2D trigonometric polynomials: uniform sensor arrangements, Delta-dense sensor arrangements and incrementally constructed sensor arrangements.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Chemical sensors","Temperature sensors","Estimation error","Estimation theory","Sea measurements","Ocean temperature","Chemical hazards","Chemical technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","polynomials","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error tolerant arrangement classes","uniform sensor arrangements","sampling fields","sensor measurements","linear estimation theory","mobile sensors","2D trigonometric polynomials","Delta-dense sensor arrangements"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4586851","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04586851.pdf","startPage":"2401","endPage":"2408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4586851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Tolerant Arrangements of sensors for sampling fields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Error Tolerant Arrangements of sensors for sampling fields","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586851/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586851/","accessionNumber":"10068030","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Tolerant Arrangements of sensors for sampling fields","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"396_1336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050415S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4586851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4586884,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Sun","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Jun Sun","id":"37087143433"},{"name":"Wei Fang","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Wei Fang","id":"37087373240"},{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Wei Chen","id":"37087197562"},{"name":"Wenbo Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Wenbo Xu","id":"37087182075"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2078-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2079-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"4586884","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Digital filters","Particle swarm optimization","IIR filters","Signal processing algorithms","Design optimization","Finite impulse response filter","Quantum mechanics","Sun","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IIR filters","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional IIR digital filter","quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm","recursive digital filter","quantum physics","diversity-guided QPSO","constraint minimization problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586884","abstract":"The design problem of two-dimensional recursive digital filters is generally reduced to a constraint minimization problem.

The proposed approach assumes that the UAV has detailed information of the environment only in the vicinity of its current position. Information about far away obstacles is also available, albeit with less accuracy. The proposed algorithm uses an integer arithmetic implementation of the fast lifting wavelet transform (FLWT) to get a multiresolution cell decomposition of the environment, whose dimension is commensurate to the onboard computational resources. A topological graph representation of the multiresolution cell decomposition is constructed efficiently, directly from the approximation and detail wavelet coefficients. Hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) results validate the applicability of the algorithm on a small UAV autopilot. Comparisons with the standard D*-lite algorithm are also presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04586908.pdf","startPage":"2744","endPage":"2749","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4586908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4586908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiresolution on-line path planning for small unmanned aerial vehicles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Spatial resolution","Discrete wavelet transforms","Arithmetic","Wavelet transforms","Wavelet coefficients","Trajectory","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Laser radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","approximation theory","graph theory","microrobots","mobile robots","path planning","remotely operated vehicles","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online multiresolution path planning algorithm","small unmanned aerial vehicle autopilot","integer arithmetic implementation","fast lifting wavelet transform coefficient","onboard computational resource","topological graph representation","multiresolution cell decomposition","approximation coefficient","hardware-in-the-loop simulation","D*-lite algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multiresolution on-line path planning for small unmanned aerial vehicles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586908/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10067671","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiresolution on-line path planning for small unmanned aerial vehicles","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"453_0705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.140874S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4586908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4586916,"authors":[{"name":"Subhadeep Chakraborty","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Subhadeep","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37534533700"},{"name":"Soumik Sarkar","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Soumik","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37401189700"},{"name":"Asok Ray","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Asok","lastName":"Ray","id":"37277094200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2078-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2079-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"4586916","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System identification","Monitoring","Control systems","Automata","Filtering","Context modeling","Automatic control","Feedback control","Electronic equipment testing","Nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","feedback","filtering theory","identification","large-scale systems","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbolic identification","anomaly detection","complex dynamical systems","symbolic dynamic filtering","closed loop control","feedback control actions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Symbolic Dynamics","System Identification","Fixed Structure Automata"]}],"abstract":"Symbolic dynamic filtering (SDF) has been reported in recent literature for early detection of anomalies (i.e., deviations from the nominal behavior) in complex dynamical systems. In this context, instead of solely relying on physics- based modeling that may be difficult to formulate and validate, this paper proposes data-driven modeling and system identification based on the concept of symbolic dynamics, automata theory, and information theory. For anomaly detection in inter-connected complex dynamical systems, with or without closed loop control, the input excitation to an individual component is likely to deviate from the nominal condition as a result of deterioration of some other component(s) or to accommodate disturbance rejection by feedback control actions. This paper presents a formal-language-based syntactic method of anomaly detection to account for deviations in the pertinent input excitation. A training algorithm is formulated to generate an automaton model of the underlying subsystem or component from a set of input-output combinations for different classes of inputs, where the objective is to detect (possibly gradually evolving) anomalies under different input conditions. The proposed method has been validated on a test apparatus of nonlinear active electronics.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbolic identification and anomaly detection in complex dynamical systems","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4586916","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04586916.pdf","startPage":"2792","endPage":"2797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4586916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Symbolic identification and anomaly detection in complex dynamical systems","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586916/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10067590","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbolic identification and anomaly detection in complex dynamical systems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"461_0580.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091508S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4586916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACCIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4586931,"authors":[{"name":"Mauricio Cea","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Mauricio","lastName":"Cea","id":"37545327500"},{"name":"Mario E.

Using the lessons learned from the X-15 program as well as decades of work in the field of stable adaptive control, a provably correct (PC) adaptive controller is designed for the X-15.

Event-triggering requires a subsystem to only broadcast its state information when the local state error exceeds a given threshold. The paper designs an event triggering scheme that assures asymptotic stability of the entire networked system. The results apply to networks of linear time-invariant systems. We derive a lower bound on the estimated time to next broadcast. Simulation results show that event triggering allows a subsystem to adjust its broadcast periods to the amount of activity in its immediate neighborhood. Simulation results also show that event-triggering's average broadcast period scales well with system size. These results are significant because they show how one might stabilize distributed control systems over ad hoc wireless networks without necessarily requiring a high degree of synchronization within the communication network.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4586975","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04586975.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4586975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","startPage":"3139","endPage":"3144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-triggered broadcasting across distributed networked control systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Event-triggered broadcasting across distributed networked control systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586975/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10060673","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4586975/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-triggered broadcasting across distributed networked control systems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"520_0125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068283S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4586975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4586976,"authors":[{"name":"Brett Bethke","affiliation":["Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Brett","lastName":"Bethke","id":"37545474300"},{"name":"Jonathan P.

The complex and distributed nature of these missions often requires teams of UAVs to work together. Furthermore, overall mission performance can be strongly influenced by vehicle failures or degradations, so an autonomous mission system must account for the possibility of these anomalies if it is to maximize performance. This paper presents a general health management methodology for designing mission systems that can anticipate the negative effects of various types of anomalies on the future mission state and choose actions that mitigate those effects. The formulation is then specialized to the problem of providing persistent surveillance coverage using a group of UAVs, where uncertain fuel usage dynamics and strong interdependence effects between vehicles must be considered. Finally, the paper presents results showing that the health-aware persistent surveillance planner based on this formulation exhibits excellent performance in both simulated and real flight test experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586976/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10060773","publicationDate":"June 2008","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586976/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Group health management of UAV teams with applications to persistent surveillance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group health management of UAV teams with applications to persistent surveillance","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"521_1086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11201S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4586976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4586978,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Olfati-Saber","affiliation":["Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Olfati-Saber","id":"38293554900"},{"name":"Nils F.

In such sensor networks, a target can only be observed by a small percentage of the sensors and is practically hidden to the remaining majority of the nodes. This feature is shared among most of today's wireless sensor networks and differentiates them from their traditional counterparts involving data fusion for long-range sensors such as radars and sonars. Distributed Kalman filters have proven to be effective and scalable algorithms for distributed tracking in sensor networks. Our main contribution is to give a message-passing version of the Kalman- Consensus Filter (KCF) - introduced by the first author in CDC '07 - that is capable of distributed tracking of a maneuvering target with a satisfactory performance. The architecture of this filter is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of microfllters as extensions of local Kalman filters. The model proposed for the maneuvering target is a piece-wise linear switching system with two distinct modes of behavior that enables the target to stay inside a rectangular region in all time (for a bounded set of initial conditions). Simulation results are provided for a lattice-type sensor network with 100 LSR nodes tracking a target with switching modes of behavior which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed data fusion and tracking algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4586978","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04586978.pdf","startPage":"3157","endPage":"3162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4586978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed tracking in sensor networks with limited sensing range","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4586978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4586978/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed tracking in sensor networks with limited sensing range","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10067680","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4586978/","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed tracking in sensor networks with limited sensing range","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"523_0730.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051212S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4586978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACCIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4586986,"authors":[{"name":"Peter I.

In this paper the convergence behavior is investigated under parallel Gibbs sampling, where all mobile nodes update their locations simultaneously. It is established that, with a pairwise Gibbs potential, parallel Gibbs sampling and annealing minimizes a modified potential energy, where the extent of modification is determined by the maximum travel range of each node within one time step. This is the first convergence result for parallel sampling algorithms for Gibbs random fields with configuration-dependent neighborhood systems, and it provides justification for Gibbs sampling as a viable method for swarming control.

Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4587137","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04587137.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4587137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","startPage":"4111","endPage":"4116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive model reference control of a class of MIMO discrete-time systems with compensation of nonparametric uncertainty","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive model reference control of a class of MIMO discrete-time systems with compensation of nonparametric uncertainty","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587137/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10067736","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587137/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive model reference control of a class of MIMO discrete-time systems with compensation of nonparametric uncertainty","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"682_0829.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071578S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4587137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587140,"authors":[{"name":"Adolfo Anta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Adolfo","lastName":"Anta","id":"37398427600"},{"name":"Paulo Tabuada","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Tabuada","id":"37300854400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2078-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2079-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"4587140","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":648},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Sampling methods","Nonlinear systems","Processor scheduling","Linear systems","Hardware","Asymptotic stability","Feedback control","Nonlinear equations","Solids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","continuous systems","feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-triggered stabilization","homogeneous control systems","feedback laws","asymptotic stability","sample-and-hold implementations","homogeneity assumption","continuous dynamics","event-triggered implementations","real-time scheduling requirements"]}],"abstract":"Digital implementations of feedback laws commonly consider periodic execution of control tasks. In this paper we go beyond the periodic model by developing self-triggered schedules for the execution of control tasks. These schedules guarantee asymptotic stability under sample-and-hold implementations while drastically reducing processor usage when compared with the more traditional periodic implementations. At the technical level the results rely on a homogeneity assumption on the continuous dynamics and extend to the self-triggered framework some of the advantages of event-triggered implementations recently studied by the authors. The results presented in this paper can be seen as an effort towards understanding the real-time scheduling requirements of control tasks.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4587140","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04587140.pdf","startPage":"4129","endPage":"4134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4587140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-triggered stabilization of homogeneous control systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Self-triggered stabilization of homogeneous control systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587140/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10067528","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-triggered stabilization of homogeneous control systems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"685_0493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04933S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4587140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4587145,"authors":[{"name":"Baosen Zhang","affiliation":["Division of Engineering Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Baosen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38088729900"},{"name":"Scott B.

We show that delay in the feedback path is of fundamental importance to the stability and performance of the SOA system. Due to the sub-nanosecond dynamics, the SOA system is a challenging system to control. We derive a design tradeoff on the feedback controller and delay stability margin of the closed-loop system.

The goal for the vehicles is to collect rewards obtained when they visit the targets in a particular state. This problem can be seen as a type of restless bandits problem with partial information. We compute an upper bound on the achievable performance and obtain in closed form an index policy proposed by Whittle. Simulation results provide evidence for the outstanding performance of this index heuristic and for the quality of the upper bound.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4587156","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04587156.pdf","startPage":"4220","endPage":"4225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4587156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-UAV dynamic routing with partial observations using restless bandit allocation indices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587156/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-UAV dynamic routing with partial observations using restless bandit allocation indices","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10067545","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587156/","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-UAV dynamic routing with partial observations using restless bandit allocation indices","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"701_0516.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073457S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4587156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4587163,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It is based on a unique active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) strategy, which actively estimates and compensates for internal dynamic changes of the plant and external disturbances in real time. The stability analysis shows that both the estimation error and the tracking error of the drive axis output are bounded and the upper bounds of the errors monotonously decrease with the bandwidths. The control system is simulated and tested using a field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based digital implementation on a piezoelectric vibration gyroscope. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control method not only drives the drive axis to vibrate along the desired trajectory but also compensates for manufacture imperfections in a robust fashion that is insensitive to parameter variations and noises.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active disturbance rejection control for MEMS gyroscopes","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4587191","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04587191.pdf","startPage":"4425","endPage":"4430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4587191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587191","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587191/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Active disturbance rejection control for MEMS gyroscopes","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587191/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10067807","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active disturbance rejection control for MEMS gyroscopes","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"736_0952.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077819S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4587191","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACCIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4587204,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenzo Serrao","affiliation":["Center for Automotive Research, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Serrao","id":"37573414300"},{"name":"Giorgio Rizzoni","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering, Center for Automotive Research, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Rizzoni","id":"37298200300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2078-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2079-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"4587204","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":664},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal control","Waste materials","Hybrid electric vehicles","Mechanical power transmission","Vehicle driving","Automotive engineering","Fuel economy","Road vehicles","Engines","Energy management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid electric vehicles","minimum principle","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal control","optimal power split strategy","hybrid electric refuse truck","Pontryagin minimum principle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optimal control","hybrid electric vehicles"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587204","abstract":"An optimal power split strategy in a hybrid electric refuse truck is presented.

In this paper, many efforts to design the most popular control strategies, i.e. PID and MPC, by using multi-objective optimization techniques are reviewed.

The Pldrquasi-IldrD control is constructed by modifying the integral operation of the PID control. The purpose is to design a Pldrquasi-IldrD controller for aysmptotic stabilization and to adjust PID parameter matrices for improving convergence speed of responces under guaranteeing the stability. In our method, we consider a certain hypothetical system derived from the closed loop system with Pldrquasi-IldrD control in order to apply high gain output feedback. Then the PID parameter matrices are adjusted by making zero dynamics of the hypothetical system asymptotically stable and performing the high gain output feedback. The proposed method is fundamentally based on the high gain output feedback theorem. The effectiveness of the method is confirmed by simulation results for unstable MIMO plants.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4587243","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04587243.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4587243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","startPage":"4739","endPage":"4745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"P\u00b7quasi-I\u00b7D control for MIMO systems \u2014Stabilization based on high gain output feedback\u2014","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"P\u00b7quasi-I\u00b7D control for MIMO systems \u2014Stabilization based on high gain output feedback\u2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587243/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10067363","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587243/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"P\u00b7quasi-I\u00b7D control for MIMO systems \u2014Stabilization based on high gain output feedback\u2014","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"788_0141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055096S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4587243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACCIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587245,"authors":[{"name":"T.

As is well known, symmetric affine system is uncontrollable with continuous time-invariant differentiable state feedback. In this paper we apply direct gradient descent control (DGDC) for the symmetric affine system. The DGDC is such a method that we manipulate control inputs directly so as to decrease a performance function by the steepest descent method. Note that the DGDC is a dynamic controller that we can adjust not only its gain parameter but also its initial condition. Then, not only controllable part of symmetric affine system is asymptotically stabilized, but also uncontrollable part can be converged to the origin by choosing the initial condition appropriately. Applying the DGDC, we can control the symmetric affine system without transforming it into the \"chained form\". Simulation results for a four wheeled vehicle and a flying robot demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04587308.pdf","startPage":"5130","endPage":"5135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4587308","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4587308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stabilizing control of symmetric affine systems by Direct Gradient Descent Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stabilizing control of symmetric affine systems by Direct Gradient Descent Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587308/","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587308/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10060681","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilizing control of symmetric affine systems by Direct Gradient Descent Control","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"853_0140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054643S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4587308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587310,"authors":[{"name":"Mauricio Zapateiro","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics and Applications, University of Girona, Spain"],"firstName":"Mauricio","lastName":"Zapateiro","id":"37402353100"},{"name":"Ningsu Luo","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics and Applications, University of Girona, Spain"],"lastName":"Ningsu Luo","id":"37087206633"},{"name":"Hamid Reza Karimi","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics and Applications, University of Girona, Spain"],"firstName":"Hamid Reza","lastName":"Karimi","id":"37287723700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2078-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2079-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"4587310","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vibration control","Shock absorbers","Damping","Uncertainty","Buildings","Floors","Frequency","Informatics","Feedback","Hysteresis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control charts","control nonlinearities","control system synthesis","damping","feedback","magnetorheology","structural engineering","vibration control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantitative feedback theory control","vibration reduction","MR dampers","6-story building structure","shear-mode magnetorheological dampers","nonlinear hysteretic behavior","uncertainty template","Nichols chart"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587310","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4587310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4587310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04587310.pdf","startPage":"5142","endPage":"5144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QFT control for vibration reduction in structures equipped with MR dampers","abstract":"This short paper addresses the problem of designing a QFT (Quantitative Feedback Theory) based controllers for the vibration reduction in a 6-story building structure equipped with shear-mode magnetorheological dampers.

However, modeling and control of such a system are very challenging because of its complicated mechanism. In this paper, we achieve the kinematics of the mobile platform according to its mechanical structure firstly, and then deduce its unified dynamic model by Lagrangian formalism. By applying the unified model to calculate the coupling torque vector between the mobile platform and the robot arm, an adaptive hybrid controller is proposed subsequently. This controller consists of two parts: one is responsible for the tracking control of the mobile platform in kinematics. The other part is for the robot arm in dynamics. For further consideration of unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances, a Radial Basis Function Neural-Network (RBFNN) is adopted in the adaptive controller. Simulation results show the correctness of the presented model and the effectiveness of the control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4587316","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04587316.pdf","startPage":"5174","endPage":"5179","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4587316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive hybrid control for omnidirectional mobile manipulators using neural-network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive hybrid control for omnidirectional mobile manipulators using neural-network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10067689","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587316/","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive hybrid control for omnidirectional mobile manipulators using neural-network","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"861_0740.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07802S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4547420","isNumber":"4586444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4547420","xplore-issue":"4586444","articleId":"4587316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACCIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4587329,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Raff","affiliation":["Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic Control (IST), University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Raff","id":"37300988100"},{"name":"Markus Kogel","affiliation":["Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic Control (IST), University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Kogel","id":"37543467600"},{"name":"Frank Allgower","affiliation":["Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic Control (IST), University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Allgower","id":"37271661500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2078-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2079-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"4587329","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":419},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Observers","Control systems","Estimation error","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Technological innovation","Nonlinear control systems","Linear matrix inequalities","Time measurement","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous time systems","linear matrix inequalities","nonlinear control systems","observers","sampled data systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample-and-hold updating","Lipschitz nonlinear systems","nonuniformly sampled measurements","sampled-data control","linear continuous-time systems","linear matrix inequality","LMI","observer matrix","global stability","estimation error dynamics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587329","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2008.4587329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4587329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4586444","publicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547420/4586444/04587329.pdf","startPage":"5254","endPage":"5257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Observer with sample-and-hold updating for Lipschitz nonlinear systems with nonuniformly sampled measurements","abstract":"This paper presents a new observer design for Lipschitz nonlinear continuous-time systems with nonuniformly sampled measurements.

In the learning phase, the two tensor models are constructed for NIR and 3D images respectively, and a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) based multi-variate mapping from NIR to 3D faces is learned from a given training set of NIR-3D face pairs. In the reconstruction phase, given an NIR face image, the depth map is computed directly using the learned mapping with the help of tensor models. Experimental results are provided to evaluate the accuracy and speed of the method. The work provides a practical solution for reliable and fast shape recovery and modeling of 3D objects.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587341.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face shape recovery from a single image using CCA mapping between tensor spaces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Tensile stress","Image reconstruction","Humans","Surface reconstruction","Face detection","Surface fitting","Magnetic force microscopy","Lighting","Infrared imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image reconstruction","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face shape recovery","CCA mapping","tensor spaces","near infrared image","shape recovery","canonical correlation analysis","multivariate mapping","NIR face image"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Face shape recovery from a single image using CCA mapping between tensor spaces","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587341/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139646","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face shape recovery from a single image using CCA mapping between tensor spaces","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104304S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587352,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Hu","affiliation":["MOE-Microsoft Key Lab of MCC, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"lastName":"Yang Hu","id":"37087393064"},{"name":"Mingjing Li","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Mingjing Li","id":"37087146265"},{"name":"Nenghai Yu","affiliation":["MOE-Microsoft Key Lab of MCC, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"lastName":"Nenghai Yu","id":"37087162181"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587352","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":718},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587352","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image retrieval","Feedback","Asia","Information retrieval","Search engines","Image classification","Animals","Calibration","Image converters","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image representation","image retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-instance ranking","image retrieval","ranking model","image ranking","relevant images","irrelevant images","binary classifier","multiple-instance assumption","Flickr","photo sharing service"]}],"abstract":"We study the problem of learning to rank images for image retrieval.

Paired data are common in real world data sources, such as images with text captions. Traditional spectral clustering algorithms either assume that data can be represented by a single similarity measure, or by co-occurrence matrices that are then used in biclustering. In contrast, the proposed method uses separate similarity measures for each data representation, and allows for projection of previously unseen data that are only observed in one representation (e.g. images but not text). We show that this algorithm generalizes traditional spectral clustering algorithms and show consistent empirical improvement over spectral clustering on a variety of datasets of images with associated text.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587353.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlational spectral clustering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Clustering algorithms","Humans","Testing","Linear discriminant analysis","Cybernetics","Spectral analysis","Labeling","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","image processing","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlational spectral clustering","kernel canonical correlation analysis","data sources","co-occurrence matrices","data representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Correlational spectral clustering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587353/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587353/","accessionNumber":"10139658","publicationDate":"June 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlational spectral clustering","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079088S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4587358,"authors":[{"name":"Gustavo Carneiro","affiliation":["Integrated Data Systems Department, Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Carneiro","id":"37269880000"},{"name":"Fernando Amat","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Amat","id":"37891712600"},{"name":"Bogdan Georgescu","affiliation":["Integrated Data Systems Department, Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Georgescu","id":"37397668000"},{"name":"Sara Good","affiliation":["Innovations Division, Siemens Medical Solutions, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Good","id":"37397488600"},{"name":"Dorin Comaniciu","affiliation":["Integrated Data Systems Department, Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Dorin","lastName":"Comaniciu","id":"37275320000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587358","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":181},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587358","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexing","Anatomy","Ultrasonic imaging","Sampling methods","Biometrics","Time measurement","Ultrasonic variables measurement","Data processing","Fetus","Context modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical measurement","biomedical ultrasonics","medical image processing","obstetrics","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic-based indexing","fetal anatomies","3D ultrasound data","sequential sampling","context sampling","fetal biometric measurements","post-exam data processing","principled probabilistic model","discriminative classifiers","generative classifiers","semantic keywords"]}],"abstract":"The use of 3-D ultrasound data has several advantages over 2-D ultrasound for fetal biometric measurements, such as considerable decrease in the examination time, possibility of post-exam data processing by experts and the ability to produce 2-D views of the fetal anatomies in orientations that cannot be seen in common 2-D ultrasound exams. However, the search for standardized planes and the precise localization of fetal anatomies in ultrasound volumes are hard and time consuming processes even for expert physicians and sonographers. The relative low resolution in ultrasound volumes, small size of fetus anatomies and inter-volume position, orientation and size variability make this localization problem even more challenging. In order to make the plane search and fetal anatomy localization problems completely automatic, we introduce a novel principled probabilistic model that combines discriminative and generative classifiers with contextual information and sequential sampling. We implement a system based on this model, where the user queries consist of semantic keywords that represent anatomical structures of interest. After queried, the system automatically displays standardized planes and produces biometric measurements of the fetal anatomies. Experimental results on a held-out test set show that the automatic measurements are within the inter-user variability of expert users.

Current probabilistic approaches to learn this mapping have been limited in their ability to handle domains with a large number of activities that require very large training sets. We propose an online probabilistic regression scheme for efficient inference of complex, high- dimensional, and multimodal mappings. Our technique is based on a local mixture of Gaussian processes, where locality is defined based on both appearance and pose, and where the mapping hyperparameters can vary across local neighborhoods to better adapt to specific regions in the pose space. The mixture components are defined online in very small neighborhoods, so learning and inference is extremely efficient. When the mapping is one-to-one, we derive a bound on the approximation error of local regression (vs. global regression) for monotonically decreasing co- variance functions. Our method can determine when training examples are redundant given the rest of the database, and use this criteria for pruning.

Recognition of a category can therefore be made easier by detecting its constituent subcategories and combing these detection results. Given a set of training images, each labeled by an object category contained in it, we present an approach to learning: (1) Taxonomy defined by recursive sharing of subcategories by multiple image categories; (2) Subcategory relevance as the degree of evidence a subcategory offers for the presence of its parent; (3) Likelihood that the image contains a subcategory; and (4) Prior that a subcategory occurs. The images are represented as points in a feature space spanned by confidences in the occurrences of the subcategories. The subcategory relevances are estimated as weights, necessary to rescale the corresponding axes of the feature space so that the images with the same label are closer to each other than to those with different labels. When a new image is encountered, the learned taxonomy, relevances, likelihoods, and priors are used by a linear classifier to categorize the image. On the challenging Caltech-256 dataset, the proposed approach significantly outperforms the best categorizations reported. This result is significant in that it not only demonstrates the advantages of exploiting subcategory taxonomy for recognition, but also suggests that a feature space spanned by part properties, instead of direct object properties, allows for linear separation of image classes.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587366.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning subcategory relevances for category recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587366","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Learning subcategory relevances for category recognition","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139671","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587366/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning subcategory relevances for category recognition","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093835S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4587367,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Schmidt","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Schmidt","id":"37826483300"},{"name":"Kevin Murphy","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Murphy","id":"37283740700"},{"name":"Glenn Fung","affiliation":["Siemens Medical Solutions, IKM CAD and Knowledge Solutions USA, Inc., Malvern, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Glenn","lastName":"Fung","id":"37300303300"},{"name":"Romer Rosales","affiliation":["Siemens Medical Solutions, IKM CAD and Knowledge Solutions USA, Inc., Malvern, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Romer","lastName":"Rosales","id":"37332039700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587367","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":294},"abstract":"Coronary Heart Disease can be diagnosed by assessing the regional motion of the heart walls in ultrasound images of the left ventricle.

Previous work indicates that in order to approach this problem, the interactions between the different heart regions and their overall influence on the clinical condition of the heart need to be considered. To do this, we propose a method for jointly learning the structure and parameters of conditional random fields, formulating these tasks as a convex optimization problem. We consider block-L1 regularization for each set of features associated with an edge, and formalize an efficient projection method to find the globally optimal penalized maximum likelihood solution. We perform extensive numerical experiments comparing the presented method with related methods that approach the structure learning problem differently.

We propose a new algorithmic way of generating such clusters from a graph without exponentially increasing the size of the graph during triangulation. In order to perform the statistical region labeling, we introduce the use of superpixels for the nodes of the graph, as it is a more natural representation of an image than the pixel grid. This results in a smaller but much more highly interconnected graph where BP consistently fails.

Each composite feature is constructed from the combination of multiple individual features. Unlike previous works that design features manually or with certain restrictions, the class specific features are selected from the space of all combinations of a set of individual features. To achieve this, we first establish an analogue between the problem of discriminative feature selection and generative image segmentation, and then draw discriminative samples from the combinatory space with a novel algorithm called discriminative generalized Swendsen-Wang cut. These samples form the initial pool of features, where AdaBoost is applied to learn a strong classifier combining the most discriminative composite features. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by comparing with existing detection algorithms for finding people in general pose.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Object detection","Face detection","Computer vision","Image sampling","Image segmentation","Voting","Image generation","Detection algorithms","Image converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sampling","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class specific composite features","discriminative sampling","Swendsen-Wang cut","AdaBoost","multiple individual features","discriminative feature selection","generative image segmentation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587376","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587376.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discovering class specific composite features through discriminative sampling with Swendsen-Wang Cut","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587376","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discovering class specific composite features through discriminative sampling with Swendsen-Wang Cut","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587376/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587376/","accessionNumber":"10139681","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discovering class specific composite features through discriminative sampling with Swendsen-Wang Cut","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK","sourcePdf":"036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065547S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4587387,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhou","affiliation":["NICTA, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"lastName":"Jun Zhou","id":"37087197332"},{"name":"Antonio Robles-Kelly","affiliation":["RSISE, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Robles-Kelly","id":"38270627800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587387","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sampling","Image retrieval","Information retrieval","Content based retrieval","Australia","Image databases","Clustering algorithms","Multidimensional systems","Indexing","Tree graphs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation-maximisation algorithm","image retrieval","image sampling","pattern clustering","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi-random sampling approach","image retrieval","images database","image query","EM algorithm","intra-cluster structure","statistical confidence","Oxford Flowers dataset"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587387","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel approach to contents-based image retrieval. The method hinges in the use of quasi-random sampling to retrieve those images in a database which are related to a query image provided by the user. Departing from random sampling theory, we make use of the EM algorithm so as to organize the images in the database into compact clusters that can then be used for stratified random sampling. For the purposes of retrieval, we use the similarity between the query and the clustered images to govern the sampling process within clusters. In this way, the sampling can be viewed as a stratified sampling one which is random at the cluster level and takes into account the intra-cluster structure of the dataset. This approach leads to a measure of statistical confidence that relates to the theoretical hard-limit of the retrieval performance. We show results on the Oxford Flowers dataset.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587387","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587387.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A quasi-random sampling approach to image retrieval","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A quasi-random sampling approach to image retrieval","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587387/","accessionNumber":"10139692","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587387/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A quasi-random sampling approach to image retrieval","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07106S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4587391,"authors":[{"name":"Shiqian Ma","affiliation":["Department of IEOR, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Shiqian Ma","id":"38089713300"},{"name":"Wotao Yin","affiliation":["Department of CAAM, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Wotao Yin","id":"37404056600"},{"name":"Yin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of CAAM, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Yin Zhang","id":"37405809100"},{"name":"Amit Chakraborty","affiliation":["Integrated Data Systems, Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37287168800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587391","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1914},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Image reconstruction","Image coding","Compressed sensing","Iterative algorithms","Mathematics","Signal processing","Magnetic resonance imaging","Least squares methods","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","data compression","fast Fourier transforms","image coding","least squares approximations","medical image processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed MR imaging","total variation","compressed sensing","MRI scan","least squares measure","iterative operator-splitting framework","fast wavelet transforms","fast Fourier transforms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587391","abstract":"Compressed sensing, an emerging multidisciplinary field involving mathematics, probability, optimization, and signal processing, focuses on reconstructing an unknown signal from a very limited number of samples. Because information such as boundaries of organs is very sparse in most MR images, compressed sensing makes it possible to reconstruct the same MR image from a very limited set of measurements significantly reducing the MRI scan duration. In order to do that however, one has to solve the difficult problem of minimizing nonsmooth functions on large data sets.

We show that faithful MR images can be reconstructed from a subset that represents a mere 20 percent of the complete set of measurements.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587391","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587391.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient algorithm for compressed MR imaging using total variation and wavelets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient algorithm for compressed MR imaging using total variation and wavelets","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10139696","publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587391/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587391/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient algorithm for compressed MR imaging using total variation and wavelets","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073898S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4587403,"authors":[{"name":"David Liu","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Liu","id":"37290604600"},{"name":"Gang Hua","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Microsoft Live Laboratories Research, USA"],"lastName":"Gang Hua","id":"37087162546"},{"name":"Paul Viola","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Microsoft Live Laboratories Research, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Viola","id":"37270939500"},{"name":"Tsuhan Chen","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"lastName":"Tsuhan Chen","id":"37087145512"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587403","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":92,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":814},"abstract":"In computer vision, the bag-of-visual words image representation has been shown to yield good results.

Higher-order spatial features are progressively extracted based on selected lower order ones, thereby avoiding exhaustive computation. The method can be based on any additive feature selection algorithm such as boosting. Experimental results show that the method is computationally much more efficient than previous approaches, without sacrificing accuracy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Boosting","Image representation","Pipelines","Pixel","Computer vision","Pattern recognition","Random access memory","Object recognition","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image representation","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated feature selection","higher-order spatial feature extraction","object categorization","bag-of-visual words image representation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587403","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587403.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated feature selection and higher-order spatial feature extraction for object categorization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrated feature selection and higher-order spatial feature extraction for object categorization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587403/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587403/","accessionNumber":"10139708","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated feature selection and higher-order spatial feature extraction for object categorization","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK","sourcePdf":"063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066982S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4587405,"authors":[{"name":"Shuicheng Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Shuicheng Yan","id":"37272225300"},{"name":"Xi Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"lastName":"Xi Zhou","id":"37406425300"},{"name":"Ming Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"lastName":"Ming Liu","id":"37275669100"},{"name":"Mark Hasegawa-Johnson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Hasegawa-Johnson","id":"38270154300"},{"name":"Thomas S.

Firstly, each image is encoded as an ensemble of orderless coordinate patches, the global distribution of which is described by Gaussian mixture models (GMM), and then each image is further expressed as a specific distribution model by Maximum a Posteriori adaptation from the global GMM. Then the patch-kernel is designed for characterizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the derived models for any two images, and its discriminating power is further enhanced by a weak learning process, called inter-modality similarity synchronization. Finally, kernel regression is employed for ultimate human age or head pose estimation. These three stages are complementary to each other, and jointly minimize the regression error. The effectiveness of this regression framework is validated by three experiments: 1) on the YAMAHA aging database, our solution brings a more than 50% reduction in age estimation error compared with the best reported results; 2) on the FG-NET aging database, our solution based on raw image features performs even better than the state-of-the-art algorithms which require fine face alignment for extracting warped appearance features; and 3) on the CHIL head pose database, our solution significantly outperforms the best one reported in the CLEAR07 evaluation.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587405","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587405.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587405","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regression from patch-kernel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587405/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Regression from patch-kernel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587405/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10139710","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regression from patch-kernel","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097417S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587407,"authors":[{"name":"Duc-Son Pham","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Duc-Son","lastName":"Pham","id":"38183838200"},{"name":"Svetha Venkatesh","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Svetha","lastName":"Venkatesh","id":"37279180300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587407","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Databases","Principal component analysis","Linear discriminant analysis","Face recognition","Nearest neighbor searches","Statistical learning","Australia","Lighting","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminative projection","multicategory classification","Stiefel manifold","training samples","face recognition","statistical learning theory","projection matrix","dimensionality reduction","lasso regression","linear classifier","optimization problem","standard face databases"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust learning of discriminative projection for multicategory classification on the Stiefel manifold","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587407","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587407","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587407.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","abstract":"Learning a robust projection with a small number of training samples is still a challenging problem in face recognition, especially when the unseen faces have extreme variation in pose, illumination, and facial expression.

The new algorithm produces the unique discrete surface whose gradients are equal to the measured gradients in the global vertical-distance least-squares sense. We show that it has been erroneously believed that this problem has been solved before via the solution of a Poisson equation. The numerical behaviour of the algorithm allows for reliable surface reconstruction on exceedingly large scales, e.g., full digital images; moreover, the algorithm is direct, i.e., non-iterative. We demonstrate the algorithm with synthetic data as well as real data obtained via photometric stereo. The algorithm does not exhibit a low-frequency bias and is not unrealistically constrained to arbitrary boundary conditions as in previous solutions. In fact, it is the first algorithm which can reconstruct a surface of polynomial degree two or higher exactly. It is hence the first viable algorithm for online industrial inspection where real defects (as opposed to phantom defects) must be identified in a robust manner.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587414","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587414.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares methods","Surface reconstruction","Image reconstruction","Photometry","Stereo image processing","Poisson equations","Large-scale systems","Digital images","Boundary conditions","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","least squares approximations","Poisson equation","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares surface reconstruction","measured gradient fields","photometric stereo","Poisson equation","polynomial degree","global vertical-distance least-squares sense"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Least squares surface reconstruction from measured gradient fields","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587414/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587414/","accessionNumber":"10139719","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Least squares surface reconstruction from measured gradient fields","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047766S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4587420,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Maire","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Maire","id":"37268733900"},{"name":"Pablo Arbelaez","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Arbelaez","id":"37397854500"},{"name":"Charless Fowlkes","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Charless","lastName":"Fowlkes","id":"37397752900"},{"name":"Jitendra Malik","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jitendra","lastName":"Malik","id":"37282929000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587420","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":250,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1840},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Image edge detection","Semiconductor counters","Computer vision","Brightness","Filters","Shape","Image recognition","Humans","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contour detection","junction detection","junction localization","natural images","perceptual organization","shape recognition","edge detectors","Berkeley Segmentation Dataset benchmark"]}],"abstract":"Contours and junctions are important cues for perceptual organization and shape recognition. Detecting junctions locally has proved problematic because the image intensity surface is confusing in the neighborhood of a junction. Edge detectors also do not perform well near junctions. Current leading approaches to junction detection, such as the Harris operator, are based on 2D variation in the intensity signal. However, a drawback of this strategy is that it confuses textured regions with junctions. We believe that the right approach to junction detection should take advantage of the contours that are incident at a junction; contours themselves can be detected by processes that use more global approaches. In this paper, we develop a new high-performance contour detector using a combination of local and global cues. This contour detector provides the best performance to date (F=0.70) on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSDS) benchmark. From the resulting contours, we detect and localize candidate junctions, taking into account both contour salience and geometric configuration. We show that improvements in our contour model lead to better junctions. Our contour and junction detectors both provide state of the art performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using contours to detect and localize junctions in natural images","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587420","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587420.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Using contours to detect and localize junctions in natural images","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587420/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139725","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using contours to detect and localize junctions in natural images","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049508S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"250","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4587422,"authors":[{"name":"Alvina Goh","affiliation":["Center for Imaging Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Alvina","lastName":"Goh","id":"37891298700"},{"name":"Rene Vidal","affiliation":["Center for Imaging Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Rene","lastName":"Vidal","id":"37270557800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587422","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":737},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Clustering algorithms","Computer vision","Euclidean distance","Principal component analysis","Motion segmentation","Diffusion tensor imaging","Geophysics computing","Null space","Extraterrestrial measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalisation (artificial intelligence)","geometry","image motion analysis","image representation","image segmentation","matrix algebra","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Riemannian Manifolds","data clustering","data representation","local nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms","generalizations","Riemannian spaces","Riemannian metric","data segmentation","2D motion segmentation","diffusion tensor imaging segmentation"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel algorithm for clustering data sampled from multiple submanifolds of a Riemannian manifold.

However, how to learn an effective and efficient context model, together with the image appearance, remains mostly unknown. The current literature using Markov random fields (MRFs) and conditional random fields (CRFs) often involves specific algorithm design, in which the modeling and computing stages are studied in isolation. In this paper, we propose an auto-context algorithm. Given a set of training images and their corresponding label maps, we first learn a classifier on local image patches. The discriminative probability (or classification confidence) maps by the learned classifier are then used as context information, in addition to the original image patches, to train a new classifier. The algorithm then iterates to approach the ground truth. Auto-context learns an integrated low-level and context model, and is very general and easy to implement. Under nearly the identical parameter setting in the training, we apply the algorithm on three challenging vision applications: object segmentation, human body configuration, and scene region labeling. It typically takes about 30 ~ 70 seconds to run the algorithm in testing. Moreover, the scope of the proposed algorithm goes beyond high-level vision. It has the potential to be used for a wide variety of problems of multi-variate labeling.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587436","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587436.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587436","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Auto-context and its application to high-level vision tasks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Auto-context and its application to high-level vision tasks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587436/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587436/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139741","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auto-context and its application to high-level vision tasks","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06677S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4587437,"authors":[{"name":"Shankar R.

Using the affine camera model, this motion segmentation problem can be cast as the problem of segmenting samples drawn from a union of linear subspaces. Due to limitations of the tracker, occlusions and the presence of nonrigid objects in the scene, the obtained motion trajectories may contain grossly mistracked features, missing entries, or not correspond to any valid motion model. In this paper, we develop a robust subspace separation scheme that can deal with all of these practical issues in a unified framework. Our methods draw strong connections between lossy compression, rank minimization, and sparse representation. We test our methods extensively and compare their performance to several extant methods with experiments on the Hopkins 155 database.

It consists of two main steps: tree fitting and partitioning. We first introduce a probabilistic method to fit a tree to a data graph under the sense of minimum entropy. Then, we propose a novel tree partitioning method under a normalized cut criterion, called normalized tree partitioning (NTP), in which a fast combinatorial algorithm is designed for exact bipartitioning. Moreover, we extend it to k-way tree partitioning by proposing an efficient best-first recursive bipartitioning scheme. Compared with spectral clustering, NTP produces the exact global optimal bipartition, introduces fewer approximations for k-way partitioning and can intrinsically produce superior performance. Compared with bottom-up aggregation methods, NTP adopts a global criterion and hence performs better. Last, experimental results on image segmentation demonstrate that our approach is more powerful compared with existing graph-based approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587454/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10139759","htmlLink":"/document/4587454/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Normalized tree partitioning for image segmentation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Normalized tree partitioning for image segmentation","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10318S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4587456,"authors":[{"name":"Zeng-Fu Wang","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"Zeng-Fu Wang","id":"37279249100"},{"name":"Zhi-Gang Zheng","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"Zhi-Gang Zheng","id":"37964883000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587456","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":62,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1722},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stereo vision","Image segmentation","Clustering algorithms","Statistics","Cost function","Layout","Labeling","Pixel","Voting","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","image colour analysis","image matching","image segmentation","iterative methods","minimisation","statistical analysis","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["region based stereo matching algorithm","inter-regional cooperative optimization","color statistics","matching cost minimisation","reference image segmentation","disparity estimation","local window-based matching method","voting based plane fitting technique","iterative optimisation","Middlebury test set"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new stereo matching algorithm based on inter-regional cooperative optimization. The proposed algorithm uses regions as matching primitives and defines the corresponding region energy functional for matching by utilizing the color statistics of regions and the constraints on smoothness and occlusion between adjacent regions. In order to obtain a more reasonable disparity map, a cooperative optimization procedure has been employed to minimize the matching costs of all regions by introducing the cooperative and competitive mechanism between regions. Firstly, a color based segmentation method is used to segment the reference image into regions with homogeneous color. Secondly, a local window-based matching method is used to determine the initial disparity estimate of each image pixel. And then, a voting based plane fitting technique is applied to obtain the parameters of disparity plane corresponding to each image region. Finally, the disparity plane parameters of all regions are iteratively optimized by an inter-regional cooperative optimization procedure until a reasonable disparity map is obtained. The experimental results on Middlebury test set and real stereo images indicate that the performance of our method is competitive with the best stereo matching algorithms and the disparity maps recovered are close to the ground truth data.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587456","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587456.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A region based stereo matching algorithm using cooperative optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587456/","displayDocTitle":"A region based stereo matching algorithm using cooperative optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139761","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587456/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A region based stereo matching algorithm using cooperative optimization","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109206S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4587462,"authors":[{"name":"Tomasz Malisiewicz","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Malisiewicz","id":"37424487200"},{"name":"Alexei A.

Our exemplars are represented as image regions and the learned distances capture the relative importance of shape, color, texture, and position features for that region. We use the distance functions to detect and segment objects in novel images by associating the bottom-up segments obtained from multiple image segmentations with the exemplar regions.

Such video material is uncontrolled and extremely challenging. We propose an approach that progressively reduces the search space for body parts, to greatly improve the chances that pose estimation will succeed. This involves two contributions: (i) a generic detector using a weak model of pose to substantially reduce the full pose search space; and (ii) employing 'grabcut' initialized on detected regions proposed by the weak model, to further prune the search space. Moreover, we also propose (Hi) an integrated spatio- temporal model covering multiple frames to refine pose estimates from individual frames, with inference using belief propagation. The method is fully automatic and self-initializing, and explains the spatio-temporal volume covered by a person moving in a shot, by soft-labeling every pixel as belonging to a particular body part or to the background. We demonstrate upper-body pose estimation by an extensive evaluation over 70000 frames from four episodes of the TV series Buffy the vampire slayer, and present an application to full- body action recognition on the Weizmann dataset.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587468","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587468.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progressive search space reduction for human pose estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587468/","displayDocTitle":"Progressive search space reduction for human pose estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139773","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587468/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressive search space reduction for human pose estimation","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07133S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"389","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4587471,"authors":[{"name":"Alastair P.

We propose a novel algorithm that produces superpixels that are forced to conform to a grid (a regular superpixel lattice).

We propose to learn a conditional probability density satisfying these desired properties for the given training data set. To do this, we formulate a novel regression problem that finds a function approximating the target density. Learning the regressor is challenging due to the high dimensionality of model parameters, C, and the complexity of relating the image and the model. Our approach makes two contributions. First, we take a multilevel refinement approach by learning a series of density functions, each of which guides the solution of optimization algorithms increasingly converging to the correct solution. Second, we propose a new data sampling algorithm that takes into account the gradient information of the target function. We have applied this learning approach to deformable shape segmentation and have achieved better accuracy than the previous methods.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587480","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587480.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conditional density learning via regression with application to deformable shape segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Conditional density learning via regression with application to deformable shape segmentation","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587480/","accessionNumber":"10139785","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587480/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conditional density learning via regression with application to deformable shape segmentation","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084034S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4587481,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew C.

To extract features from the clothing, the clothing region first must be localized or segmented in the image. At the same time, given multiple images of the same person wearing the same clothing, we expect to improve the effectiveness of clothing segmentation. Therefore, the identity recognition and clothing segmentation problems are inter-twined; a good solution for one aides in the solution for the other. We build on this idea by analyzing the mutual information between pixel locations near the face and the identity of the person to learn a global clothing mask. We segment the clothing region in each image using graph cuts based on a clothing model learned from one or multiple images believed to be the same person wearing the same clothing. We use facial features and clothing features to recognize individuals in other images. The results show that clothing segmentation provides a significant improvement in recognition accuracy for large image collections, and useful clothing masks are simultaneously produced. A further significant contribution is that we introduce a publicly available consumer image collection where each individual is identified. We hope this dataset allows the vision community to more easily compare results for tasks related to recognizing people in consumer image collections.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587481/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10139786","publicationDate":"June 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587481/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Clothing cosegmentation for recognizing people","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clothing cosegmentation for recognizing people","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08528S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4587482,"authors":[{"name":"Marius Leordeanu","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Leordeanu","id":"37281853500"},{"name":"Martial Hebert","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Martial","lastName":"Hebert","id":"37271437400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587482","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smoothing methods","Optimization methods","Computer vision","Computational modeling","Simulated annealing","Kernel","Gradient methods","Application software","Computer simulation","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","optimisation","smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smoothing-based optimization","computer vision","scale space theory","MCMC","simulated annealing","local Nelder-Mead optimization method","local optima"]}],"abstract":"We propose an efficient method for complex optimization problems that often arise in computer vision. While our method is general and could be applied to various tasks, it was mainly inspired from problems in computer vision, and it borrows ideas from scale space theory. One of the main motivations for our approach is that searching for the global maximum through the scale space of a function is equivalent to looking for the maximum of the original function, with the advantage of having to handle fewer local optima. Our method works with any non-negative, possibly non-smooth function, and requires only the ability of evaluating the function at any specific point. The algorithm is based on a growth transformation, which is guaranteed to increase the value of the scale space function at every step, unlike gradient methods. To demonstrate its effectiveness we present its performance on a few computer vision applications, and show that in our experiments it is more effective than some well established methods such as MCMC, Simulated Annealing and the more local Nelder-Mead optimization method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smoothing-based Optimization","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587482","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587482.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Smoothing-based Optimization","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587482/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139787","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smoothing-based Optimization","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066761S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587500,"authors":[{"name":"Ron Zass","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel"],"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Zass","id":"37550158900"},{"name":"Amnon Shashua","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel"],"firstName":"Amnon","lastName":"Shashua","id":"37283257600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587500","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":217,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1599},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Projection algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Scalability","Computer science","Image databases","Image recognition","Optimal matching","Pixel","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","image matching","image representation","image resolution","matrix algebra","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic graph-hypergraph matching","hyper-edge representation","probabilistic setting","convex optimization","soft matching criterion","algebraic relation","hyper-edge weight matrix","vertex-to-vertex probabilistic matching","iterative successive projection algorithm"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic graph and hypergraph matching","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587500.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587500","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587500","abstract":"We consider the problem of finding a matching between two sets of features, given complex relations among them, going beyond pairwise. Each feature set is modeled by a hypergraph where the complex relations are represented by hyper-edges. A match between the feature sets is then modeled as a hypergraph matching problem. We derive the hyper-graph matching problem in a probabilistic setting represented by a convex optimization. First, we formalize a soft matching criterion that emerges from a probabilistic interpretation of the problem input and output, as opposed to previous methods that treat soft matching as a mere relaxation of the hard matching problem. Second, the model induces an algebraic relation between the hyper-edge weight matrix and the desired vertex-to-vertex probabilistic matching. Third, the model explains some of the graph matching normalization proposed in the past on a heuristic basis such as doubly stochastic normalizations of the edge weights. A key benefit of the model is that the global optimum of the matching criteria can be found via an iterative successive projection algorithm. The algorithm reduces to the well known Sinkhorn [15] row/column matrix normalization procedure in the special case when the two graphs have the same number of vertices and a complete matching is desired. Another benefit of our model is the straight-forward scalability from graphs to hyper-graphs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10139805","htmlLink":"/document/4587500/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic graph and hypergraph matching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic graph and hypergraph matching","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049395S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"217","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4587503,"authors":[{"name":"Jamie Shotton","affiliation":["Toshiba Corporate Research and Development Center, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Jamie","lastName":"Shotton","id":"37550019800"},{"name":"Matthew Johnson","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Johnson","id":"38086891000"},{"name":"Roberto Cipolla","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Cipolla","id":"37298556800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587503","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":573,"citationCountPatent":35,"totalDownloads":4054},"abstract":"We propose semantic texton forests, efficient and powerful new low-level features.

The nodes in the trees provide (i) an implicit hierarchical clustering into semantic textons, and (ii) an explicit local classification estimate. Our second contribution, the bag of semantic textons, combines a histogram of semantic textons over an image region with a region prior category distribution. The bag of semantic textons is computed over the whole image for categorization, and over local rectangular regions for segmentation. Including both histogram and region prior allows our segmentation algorithm to exploit both textural and semantic context. Our third contribution is an image-level prior for segmentation that emphasizes those categories that the automatic categorization believes to be present. We evaluate on two datasets including the very challenging VOC 2007 segmentation dataset. Our results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in segmentation accuracy, and furthermore, our use of efficient decision forests gives at least a five-fold increase in execution speed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587503.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic texton forests for image categorization and segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Pixel","Decision trees","Histograms","Testing","Classification tree analysis","Research and development","Power engineering and energy","Power engineering computing","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","decision trees","image classification","image segmentation","pattern clustering","semantic networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic texton forests","image categorization","image segmentation","image pixels","filter-bank","local descriptors","k-means clustering","nearest-neighbor assignment","feature descriptors","implicit hierarchical clustering","explicit local classification estimate","textural context","automatic categorization","VOC 2007 segmentation dataset"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Semantic texton forests for image categorization and segmentation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587503/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139808","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantic texton forests for image categorization and segmentation","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089563S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"573","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4587507,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Wing Tai","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore","Microsoft Research Asia, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yu-Wing Tai","id":"37087570517"},{"name":"Hao Du","affiliation":["Fudan University, China","Microsoft Research Asia, China"],"lastName":"Hao Du","id":"37087770011"},{"name":"Michael S.

The proposed method provides a new higher-level layer to the traditional surveillance pipeline for anomalous event detection and scene model feedback. Pixel level probability density functions (pdfs) of appearance have been used for background modelling in the past, but modelling pixel level pdfs of object speed and size from the tracks is novel. Each pdf is modelled as a multivariate Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of the motion (destination location & transition time) and the size (width & height) parameters of the objects at that location. Output of the tracking module is used to perform unsupervised EM-based learning of every GMM. We have successfully used the proposed scene model to detect local as well as global anomalies in object tracks. We also show the use of this scene model to improve object detection through pixel-level parameter feedback of the minimum object size and background learning rate. Most object path modelling approaches first cluster the tracks into major paths in the scene, which can be a source of error. We avoid this by building local pdfs that capture a variety of tracks which are passing through them.

Since the tracking process is a dynamic optimization problem which is simultaneously influenced by the object state and the time, we propose a sequential particle swarm optimization framework by incorporating the temporal continuity information into the traditional PSO algorithm. In addition, the parameters in PSO are changed adaptively according to the fitness values of particles and the predicted motion of the tracked object, leading to a favourable performance in tracking applications. Furthermore, we show theoretically that, in a Bayesian inference view, the sequential PSO framework is in essence a multilayer importance sampling based particle filter. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the state-of-the-art particle filter and its variation - the unscented particle filter, the proposed tracking algorithm is more robust and effective, especially when the object has an arbitrary motion or undergoes large appearance changes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587512.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential particle swarm optimization for visual tracking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Particle tracking","Particle filters","Inference algorithms","Motion estimation","Motion measurement","Video sequences","Bayesian methods","Nonhomogeneous media","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","image sampling","image sequences","importance sampling","motion estimation","particle filtering (numerical methods)","particle swarm optimisation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequential particle swarm optimization","visual tracking","motion estimation","video sequence","temporal continuity information","Bayesian inference view","multilayer importance sampling","unscented particle filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Sequential particle swarm optimization for visual tracking","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587512/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139817","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential particle swarm optimization for visual tracking","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058771S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4587521,"authors":[{"name":"Oncel Tuzel","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA","Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Oncel","lastName":"Tuzel","id":"37295161800"},{"name":"Fatih Porikli","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Fatih","lastName":"Porikli","id":"37283409500"},{"name":"Peter Meer","affiliation":["CS, ECE, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Meer","id":"37270529300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587521","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":651},"abstract":"This paper presents a novel learning based tracking model combined with object detection.

The learning model is extended to train a class specific tracking function, which is then integrated to an existing pose dependent object detector to build a pose invariant object detection algorithm. The proposed model can accurately detect objects in various poses, where the size of the search space is only a fraction compared to the existing object detection methods. The detection rate of the original detector is improved by more than 90% for large transformations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Motion estimation","Target tracking","Algebra","Detectors","Computer vision","Least squares approximation","Computer errors","Nonlinear optics","Image motion analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","Lie algebras","Lie groups","motion estimation","object detection","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lie groups","learning based tracking model","object detection","Euclidean space assumption","computer vision","Lie algebra","pose dependent object detector","pose invariant object detection algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587521","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587521.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning on lie groups for invariant detection and tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587521","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning on lie groups for invariant detection and tracking","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587521/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587521/","accessionNumber":"10139826","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning on lie groups for invariant detection and tracking","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058785S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4587529,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Valenti","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Lab Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Valenti","id":"37398127200"},{"name":"Theo Gevers","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Lab Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Theo","lastName":"Gevers","id":"37269830500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587529","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":110,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1735},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Hardware","Cameras","Eyes","Mechanical factors","Gain","Brightness","Computational efficiency","Testing","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eye center location","eye center tracking","isophote curvature","infrared high definition cameras","Web cam","relevance mechanism","BioID database","Yale Face B database"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587529","abstract":"The ubiquitous application of eye tracking is precluded by the requirement of dedicated and expensive hardware, such as infrared high definition cameras. Therefore, systems based solely on appearance (i.e. not involving active infrared illumination) are being proposed in literature. However, although these systems are able to successfully locate eyes, their accuracy is significantly lower than commercial eye tracking devices. Our aim is to perform very accurate eye center location and tracking, using a simple Web cam. By means of a novel relevance mechanism, the proposed method makes use of isophote properties to gain invariance to linear lighting changes (contrast and brightness), to achieve rotational invariance and to keep low computational costs. In this paper we test our approach for accurate eye location and robustness to changes in illumination and pose, using the BioIDand the Yale Face B databases, respectively. We demonstrate that our system can achieve a considerable improvement in accuracy over state of the art techniques.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587529","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587529.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate eye center location and tracking using isophote curvature","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587529/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Accurate eye center location and tracking using isophote curvature","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587529/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10139834","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate eye center location and tracking using isophote curvature","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066264S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4587539,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Eshel","affiliation":["Efi Arazi School of Computer Science, Herzliya, Israel"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"Eshel","id":"38098473700"},{"name":"Yael Moses","affiliation":["Efi Arazi School of Computer Science, Herzliya, Israel"],"firstName":"Yael","lastName":"Moses","id":"37371860900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587539","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":101,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1397},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Homography based multiple camera detection and tracking of people in a dense crowd","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587539","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Head","Tracking","Motion detection","Layout","Trajectory","Humans","Radio access networks","Computer science","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image segmentation","image sensors","motion estimation","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["homography based multiple camera detection","people tracking","dense crowd","human segmentation","head detection","height information extraction","2D patches"]}],"abstract":"Tracking people in a dense crowd is a challenging problem for a single camera tracker due to occlusions and extensive motion that make human segmentation difficult. In this paper we suggest a method for simultaneously tracking all the people in a densely crowded scene using a set of cameras with overlapping fields of view. To overcome occlusions, the cameras are placed at a high elevation and only peoplepsilas heads are tracked. Head detection is still difficult since each foreground region may consist of multiple subjects. By combining data from several views, height information is extracted and used for head segmentation. The head tops, which are regarded as 2D patches at various heights, are detected by applying intensity correlation to aligned frames from the different cameras. The detected head tops are then tracked using common assumptions on motion direction and velocity. The method was tested on sequences in indoor and outdoor environments under challenging illumination conditions. It was successful in tracking up to 21 people walking in a small area (2.5 people per m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n), in spite of severe and persistent occlusions.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587539","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587539.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Homography based multiple camera detection and tracking of people in a dense crowd","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587539/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139844","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587539/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Homography based multiple camera detection and tracking of people in a dense crowd","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055055S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4587540,"authors":[{"name":"George Papandreou","affiliation":["School of E.C.E, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Papandreou","id":"37282695800"},{"name":"Petros Maragos","affiliation":["School of E.C.E, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Petros","lastName":"Maragos","id":"37285070800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587540","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"abstract":"Parametric models of shape and texture such as active appearance models (AAMs) are diverse tools for deformable object appearance modeling and have found important applications in both image synthesis and analysis problems. Among the numerous algorithms that have been proposed for AAM fitting, those based on the inverse-compositional image alignment technique have recently received considerable attention due to their potential for high efficiency. However, existing fitting algorithms perform poorly when used in conjunction with models exhibiting significant appearance variation, such as AAMs trained on multiple-subject human face images. We introduce two enhancements to inverse-compositional AAM matching algorithms in order to overcome this limitation. First, we propose fitting algorithm adaptation, by means of (a) fitting matrix adjustment and (b) AAM mean template update. Second, we show how prior information can be incorporated and constrain the AAM fitting process. The inverse-compositional nature of the algorithm allows efficient implementation of these enhancements. Both techniques substantially improve AAM fitting performance, as demonstrated with experiments on publicly available multi-face datasets.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587540.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive and constrained algorithms for inverse compositional Active Appearance Model fitting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active appearance model","Parametric statistics","Active shape model","Deformable models","Image generation","Image analysis","Iterative algorithms","Shape control","Jacobian matrices","Image texture analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","image matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive algorithm","constrained algorithm","inverse compositional active appearance model fitting","image synthesis","image analysis","inverse-compositional image alignment technique","image enhancement","image matching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587540/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive and constrained algorithms for inverse compositional Active Appearance Model fitting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587540/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139845","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive and constrained algorithms for inverse compositional Active Appearance Model fitting","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108651S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4587564,"authors":[{"name":"Simon Lucey","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Lucey","id":"37266130100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587564","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Support vector machines","Iterative algorithms","Principal component analysis","Computer vision","Employment","Robots","Costs","Linear approximation","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonpositive weights","support vector tracking","canonical Lucas-Kanade algorithm","weighted Euclidean norm","nonpositive support kernel machine","discriminative classification","sparser kernel machine"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587564","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587564","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","abstract":"In this paper we demonstrate that the support vector tracking (SVT) framework first proposed by Avidan is equivalent to the canonical Lucas-Kanade (LK) algorithm with a weighted Euclidean norm.

We then propose a novel ldquononpositive support kernel machinerdquo (NSKM) to circumvent this limitation and allow the effective use of discriminative classification within the weighted LK framework. This approach ensures that the pseudo-Hessian realized within the weighted LK algorithm is positive semidefinite which allows for fast convergence and accurate alignment/tracking. A further benefit of our proposed method is that the NSKM solution results in a much sparser kernel machine than the canonical SVM leading to sizeable computational savings and much improved alignment performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587564.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enforcing non-positive weights for stable support vector tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587564/","displayDocTitle":"Enforcing non-positive weights for stable support vector tracking","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139869","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enforcing non-positive weights for stable support vector tracking","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047451S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587569,"authors":[{"name":"Antoni B.

We validate both the crowd segmentation algorithm, and the crowd counting system, on a large pedestrian dataset (2000 frames of video, containing 49,885 total pedestrian instances). Finally, we present results of the system running on a full hour of video.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587569","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587569.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy preserving crowd monitoring: Counting people without people models or tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Privacy preserving crowd monitoring: Counting people without people models or tracking","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587569/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139874","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587569/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy preserving crowd monitoring: Counting people without people models or tracking","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08299S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"531","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4587572,"authors":[{"name":"Minyoung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Minyoung Kim","id":"37833894300"},{"name":"Sanjiv Kumar","affiliation":["Google Research, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjiv","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38183554700"},{"name":"Vladimir Pavlovic","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Pavlovic","id":"37270545400"},{"name":"Henry Rowley","affiliation":["Google Research, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"Rowley","id":"37294882200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587572","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2006},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Videos","Target tracking","Lighting","Face detection","Robustness","Particle tracking","Filtering","YouTube","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image sequences","particle filtering (numerical methods)","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face tracking","face recognition","visual constraints","real-world videos","noisy videos","video setting","particle filtering framework","generic face","subsequent recognition phase","video sequence duration","video-based face recognizer"]}],"abstract":"We address the problem of tracking and recognizing faces in real-world, noisy videos. We track faces using a tracker that adaptively builds a target model reflecting changes in appearance, typical of a video setting. However, adaptive appearance trackers often suffer from drift, a gradual adaptation of the tracker to non-targets. To alleviate this problem, our tracker introduces visual constraints using a combination of generative and discriminative models in a particle filtering framework. The generative term conforms the particles to the space of generic face poses while the discriminative one ensures rejection of poorly aligned targets. This leads to a tracker that significantly improves robustness against abrupt appearance changes and occlusions, critical for the subsequent recognition phase. Identity of the tracked subject is established by fusing pose-discriminant and person-discriminant features over the duration of a video sequence. This leads to a robust video-based face recognizer with state-of-the-art recognition performance. We test the quality of tracking and face recognition on real-world noisy videos from YouTube as well as the standard Honda/UCSD database. Our approach produces successful face tracking results on over 80% of all videos without video or person-specific parameter tuning. The good tracking performance induces similarly high recognition rates: 100% on Honda/UCSD and over 70% on the YouTube set containing 35 celebrities in 1500 sequences.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587572","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587572.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face tracking and recognition with visual constraints in real-world videos","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Face tracking and recognition with visual constraints in real-world videos","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587572/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139877","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587572/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face tracking and recognition with visual constraints in real-world videos","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08076S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587573,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Cox","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Cox","id":"37400081600"},{"name":"Sridha Sridharan","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Sridha","lastName":"Sridharan","id":"37266096100"},{"name":"Simon Lucey","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Lucey","id":"37266130100"},{"name":"Jeffrey Cohn","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Cohn","id":"37270785600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587573","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":244},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Least squares congealing for unsupervised alignment of images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587573","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares methods","Cost function","Image databases","Spatial databases","Face detection","Employment","Parameter estimation","Computer vision","Entropy","Newton method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","least squares approximations","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares congealing","warp parameter update estimation","image alignment","unsupervised learning"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present an approach we refer to as ldquoleast squares congealingrdquo which provides a solution to the problem of aligning an ensemble of images in an unsupervised manner.

Multi-frame data association involves finding the most probable correspondences between target tracks and measurements (collected over multiple time instances) as well as handling the common tracking problems such as, track initiations and terminations, occlusions, and noisy detections. The problem is known to be NP-Hard for more than two frames. A rank constrained continuous formulation of the problem is presented that can be efficiently solved using nonlinear optimization methods. It is shown that the global and local extrema of the continuous problem respectively coincide with the maximum and the maximal solutions of the discrete counterpart. A scanning window based tracking algorithm is developed using the formulation that performs well under noisy conditions with frequent occlusions and multiple track initiations and terminations. The above claims are supported by experiments and quantitative evaluations using both synthetic and real data under different operating conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587577/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10139882","publicationDate":"June 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587577/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A rank constrained continuous formulation of multi-frame multi-target tracking problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A rank constrained continuous formulation of multi-frame multi-target tracking problem","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056945S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4587581,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Ess","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Ess","id":"37298494700"},{"name":"Bastian Leibe","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Bastian","lastName":"Leibe","id":"37298473000"},{"name":"Konrad Schindler","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Konrad","lastName":"Schindler","id":"37267277500"},{"name":"Luc Van Gool","affiliation":["KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Van Gool","id":"37266870700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587581","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":340,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2199},"abstract":"We present a mobile vision system for multi-person tracking in busy environments. Specifically, the system integrates continuous visual odometry computation with tracking-by-detection in order to track pedestrians in spite of frequent occlusions and egomotion of the camera rig. To achieve reliable performance under real-world conditions, it has long been advocated to extract and combine as much visual information as possible. We propose a way to closely integrate the vision modules for visual odometry, pedestrian detection, depth estimation, and tracking. The integration naturally leads to several cognitive feedback loops between the modules. Among others, we propose a novel feedback connection from the object detector to visual odometry which utilizes the semantic knowledge of detection to stabilize localization. Feedback loops always carry the danger that erroneous feedback from one module is amplified and causes the entire system to become instable. We therefore incorporate automatic failure detection and recovery, allowing the system to continue when a module becomes unreliable. The approach is experimentally evaluated on several long and difficult video sequences from busy inner-city locations. Our results show that the proposed integration makes it possible to deliver stable tracking performance in scenes of previously infeasible complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587581.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mobile vision system for robust multi-person tracking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vision","Layout","Feedback loop","Object detection","Mobile robots","Noise robustness","Cameras","Data mining","Detectors","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feedback","image sequences","tracking","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile vision system","multiperson tracking","continuous visual odometry computation","tracking-by-detection","pedestrian tracking","egomotion","camera rig","pedestrian detection","depth estimation","cognitive feedback loops","automatic failure detection","video sequences"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A mobile vision system for robust multi-person tracking","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587581/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139886","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mobile vision system for robust multi-person tracking","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074571S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"340","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4587583,"authors":[{"name":"Mykhaylo Andriluka","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Mykhaylo","lastName":"Andriluka","id":"37547774200"},{"name":"Stefan Roth","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Roth","id":"37282906600"},{"name":"Bernt Schiele","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernt","lastName":"Schiele","id":"37265607300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587583","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":501,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":6032},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Detectors","Hidden Markov models","Image sequences","Gaussian processes","Computer science","Legged locomotion","Cameras","Indexing","Surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian processes","image sequences","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["people-tracking-by-detection","people-detection-by-tracking","image sequences","crowded street scenes","hierarchical Gaussian process latent variable model"]}],"abstract":"Both detection and tracking people are challenging problems, especially in complex real world scenes that commonly involve multiple people, complicated occlusions, and cluttered or even moving backgrounds. People detectors have been shown to be able to locate pedestrians even in complex street scenes, but false positives have remained frequent. The identification of particular individuals has remained challenging as well. Tracking methods are able to find a particular individual in image sequences, but are severely challenged by real-world scenarios such as crowded street scenes. In this paper, we combine the advantages of both detection and tracking in a single framework. The approximate articulation of each person is detected in every frame based on local features that model the appearance of individual body parts. Prior knowledge on possible articulations and temporal coherency within a walking cycle are modeled using a hierarchical Gaussian process latent variable model (hGPLVM). We show how the combination of these results improves hypotheses for position and articulation of each person in several subsequent frames. We present experimental results that demonstrate how this allows to detect and track multiple people in cluttered scenes with reoccurring occlusions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"People-tracking-by-detection and people-detection-by-tracking","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587583","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587583.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587583","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"People-tracking-by-detection and people-detection-by-tracking","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587583/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139888","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"People-tracking-by-detection and people-detection-by-tracking","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048339S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"501","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4587584,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems, University of Southern California, USA"],"lastName":"Li Zhang","id":"37696164100"},{"name":"Yuan Li","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems, University of Southern California, USA"],"lastName":"Yuan Li","id":"37292403900"},{"name":"Ramakant Nevatia","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems, University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Ramakant","lastName":"Nevatia","id":"37279644100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587584","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":462,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":4542},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Trajectory","Optimization methods","Iterative algorithms","Intelligent robots","Iterative methods","Event detection","Costs","Linear programming","Intelligent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object detection","sensor fusion","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple object tracking","maximum-a-posteriori data association problem","MAP","cost-flow network","min-cost flow algorithm","explicit occlusion model","EOM","inter-object occlusions","public pedestrian datasets"]}],"abstract":"We propose a network flow based optimization method for data association needed for multiple object tracking.

To perform localization, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost, because the classifier function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch-and-bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of classifier functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in sublinear time. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest neighbor classifiers based on the chi\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n-distance.

Our algorithms balance these conflicting requirements, and we further improve this technique using kernel methods. Experiments conducted on popular face databases demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms LPP. Further, we show that the performance of our algorithm with partial side information (that is, using only small amount of pair-wise similarity/dissimilarity information during training) is comparable with that when using full side information. We conclude that exploiting side information by preserving both similar and dissimilar local structures of the data significantly improves performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Linear discriminant analysis","Image retrieval","Kernel","Indexing","Scattering","Access control","Information retrieval","Australia","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["side information","locality preserving projection","kernel methods","face database","computer vision"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587596","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587596.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting side information in locality preserving projection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Exploiting side information in locality preserving projection","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10139901","publicationDate":"June 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587596/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting side information in locality preserving projection","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059009S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4587597,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Felzenszwalb","affiliation":["University of Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Felzenszwalb","id":"37273317500"},{"name":"David McAllester","affiliation":["Toyota Technological Institute, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"McAllester","id":"37350105800"},{"name":"Deva Ramanan","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Deva","lastName":"Ramanan","id":"37393712400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587597","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1385,"citationCountPatent":22,"totalDownloads":10948},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deformable models","Filters","Support vector machines","Object detection","Data mining","Spatial resolution","Histograms","Computer vision","Support vector machine classification","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object detection","deformable part model","discriminative training model","margin-sensitive approach","data mining","latent SVM","multiscale model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587597","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587597.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587597","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A discriminatively trained, multiscale, deformable part model","abstract":"This paper describes a discriminatively trained, multiscale, deformable part model for object detection. Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587597/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10139902","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587597/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A discriminatively trained, multiscale, deformable part model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A discriminatively trained, multiscale, deformable part model","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086877S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"1385","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4587598,"authors":[{"name":"Oren Boiman","affiliation":["Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"],"firstName":"Oren","lastName":"Boiman","id":"37550159500"},{"name":"Eli Shechtman","affiliation":["Adobe Systems, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Eli","lastName":"Shechtman","id":"37282591600"},{"name":"Michal Irani","affiliation":["Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Irani","id":"37282593100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587598","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":683,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":5054},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587598","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image classification","Image databases","Quantization","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Boosting","Neural networks","Classification tree analysis","Degradation","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image classification","image coding","nonparametric statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nearest-neighbor based image classification","nonparametric based image classifiers","local image descriptors quantization","image-to-image distance","image-to-class distance"]}],"abstract":"State-of-the-art image classification methods require an intensive learning/training stage (using SVM, Boosting, etc.) In contrast, non-parametric nearest-neighbor (NN) based image classifiers require no training time and have other favorable properties. However, the large performance gap between these two families of approaches rendered NN-based image classifiers useless. We claim that the effectiveness of non-parametric NN-based image classification has been considerably undervalued. We argue that two practices commonly used in image classification methods, have led to the inferior performance of NN-based image classifiers: (i) Quantization of local image descriptors (used to generate \"bags-of-words \", codebooks). (ii) Computation of 'image-to-image' distance, instead of 'image-to-class' distance. We propose a trivial NN-based classifier - NBNN, (Naive-Bayes nearest-neighbor), which employs NN- distances in the space of the local image descriptors (and not in the space of images). NBNN computes direct 'image- to-class' distances without descriptor quantization. We further show that under the Naive-Bayes assumption, the theoretically optimal image classifier can be accurately approximated by NBNN. Although NBNN is extremely simple, efficient, and requires no learning/training phase, its performance ranks among the top leading learning-based image classifiers. Empirical comparisons are shown on several challenging databases (Caltech-101 ,Caltech-256 and Graz-01).","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587598","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587598.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587598","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In defense of Nearest-Neighbor based image classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"In defense of Nearest-Neighbor based image classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587598/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10139903","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In defense of Nearest-Neighbor based image classification","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051616S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"683","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587614,"authors":[{"name":"Joerg Liebelt","affiliation":["IW-SI, EADS Innovation Works, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Joerg","lastName":"Liebelt","id":"37546481000"},{"name":"Cordelia Schmid","affiliation":["LEAR, INRIA Grenoble, Montbonnot, France"],"firstName":"Cordelia","lastName":"Schmid","id":"37282990700"},{"name":"Klaus Schertler","affiliation":["IW-SI, EADS Innovation Works, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Schertler","id":"37408658000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587614","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":126,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1013},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Computer vision","Data mining","Matched filters","Filtering","Image recognition","Voting","Robustness","Yield estimation","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","filtering theory","image classification","image representation","object detection","object recognition","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["viewpoint-independent object class detection","3D feature map","object class recognition","discrete view classifier","3D object class representation","class discriminant feature extraction","pose estimation","filtering procedure","real image data matching","3D image position representation","synthetic image descriptor","3D voting scheme","3D bounding box","synthetic 3D model"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a 3D approach to multi-view object class detection. Most existing approaches recognize object classes for a particular viewpoint or combine classifiers for a few discrete views.

Our approach extracts a set of pose and class discriminant features from synthetic 3D object models using a filtering procedure, evaluates their suitability for matching to real image data and represents them by their appearance and 3D position. We term these representations 3D Feature Maps. For recognizing an object class in an image we match the synthetic descriptors to the real ones in a 3D voting scheme. Geometric coherence is reinforced by means of a robust pose estimation which yields a 3D bounding box in addition to the 2D localization. The precision of the 3D pose estimation is evaluated on a set of images of a calibrated scene. The 2D localization is evaluated on the PASCAL 2006 dataset for motorbikes and cars, showing that its performance can compete with state-of-the-art 2D object detectors.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587614.pdf","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Viewpoint-independent object class detection using 3D Feature Maps","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587614","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Viewpoint-independent object class detection using 3D Feature Maps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587614/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10139919","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587614/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Viewpoint-independent object class detection using 3D Feature Maps","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048751S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4587627,"authors":[{"name":"Jianixn Wu","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"lastName":"Jianixn Wu","id":"37066371200"},{"name":"James M.

Both place instance recognition (ldquoI am in Room 113rdquo) and category recognition (ldquoI am in an officerdquo) have been widely researched. Features that have different discriminative power/invariance tradeoff have been used separately for the two tasks. PACT captures local structures of an image through the census transform (CT), while large-scale structures are captured by the strong correlation between neighboring CT values and the histogram. The PCA operation ignores noise in the histogram distribution, computes important ldquoprimitive shapesrdquo, and results in a compact representation. Spatial PACT, a spatial pyramid of PACT, further incorporates global structures in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that spatial PACT outperforms the current state-of-the-art in several place and scene recognition, and shape matching datasets. Besides, spatial PACT is easy to implement. It has nearly no parameter to tune, and evaluates extremely fast.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587627.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Where am I: Place instance and category recognition using spatial PACT","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Principal component analysis","Histograms","Computed tomography","Shape","Robot localization","Image recognition","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Robot vision systems","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","principal component analysis","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial PACT","principal component analysis","census transform histogram","place instance recognition","category recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Where am I: Place instance and category recognition using spatial PACT","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587627/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139932","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Where am I: Place instance and category recognition using spatial PACT","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.165383S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4587630,"authors":[{"name":"Subhransu Maji","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Subhransu","lastName":"Maji","id":"37397782700"},{"name":"Alexander C.

For a class of kernels we show that one can do this much more efficiently. In particular we show that one can build histogram intersection kernel SVMs (IKSVMs) with runtime complexity of the classifier logarithmic in the number of support vectors as opposed to linear for the standard approach. We further show that by precomputing auxiliary tables we can construct an approximate classifier with constant runtime and space requirements, independent of the number of support vectors, with negligible loss in classification accuracy on various tasks.

On the Daimler Chrysler pedestrian dataset IKSVM gives comparable accuracy to the best results (based on quadratic SVM), while being 15times faster. In these experiments our approximate IKSVM is up to 2000times faster than a standard implementation and requires 200times less memory. Finally we show that a 50times speedup is possible using approximate IKSVM based on spatial pyramid features on the Caltech 101 dataset with negligible loss of accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587630.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification using intersection kernel support vector machines is efficient","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Histograms","Runtime","Object detection","Testing","Face detection","Decision trees","Classification tree analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","pattern classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intersection kernel support vector machines","straightforward classification","histogram intersection kernel","classifier logarithmic","approximate classifier","multi-level histograms","INRIA pedestrian dataset"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Classification using intersection kernel support vector machines is efficient","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587630/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139935","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification using intersection kernel support vector machines is efficient","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051612S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"587","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4587631,"authors":[{"name":"Honghao Shan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"lastName":"Honghao Shan","id":"37087541893"},{"name":"Garrison W.

In this paper, our goal is to develop efficient image search and scene matching techniques that are not only fast, but also require very little memory, enabling their use on standard hardware or even on handheld devices. Our approach uses recently developed machine learning techniques to convert the Gist descriptor (a real valued vector that describes orientation energies at different scales and orientations within an image) to a compact binary code, with a few hundred bits per image. Using our scheme, it is possible to perform real-time searches with millions from the Internet using a single large PC and obtain recognition results comparable to the full descriptor. Using our codes on high quality labeled images from the LabelMe database gives surprisingly powerful recognition results using simple nearest neighbor techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small codes and large image databases for recognition","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587633","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587633.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Small codes and large image databases for recognition","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587633/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139938","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small codes and large image databases for recognition","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054133S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"416","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4587635,"authors":[{"name":"James Philbin","affiliation":["Visual Geometry Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Philbin","id":"37332404900"},{"name":"Ondrej Chum","affiliation":["Center for Machine Perception, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Ondrej","lastName":"Chum","id":"37064078100"},{"name":"Michael Isard","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Isard","id":"37282933400"},{"name":"Josef Sivic","affiliation":["INRIA, WILLOW Project-Team, Laboratoire d'Informatique de l'Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"Sivic","id":"37282919700"},{"name":"Andrew Zisserman","affiliation":["Visual Geometry Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Zisserman","id":"37266140000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587635","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":813,"citationCountPatent":17,"totalDownloads":2739},"abstract":"The state of the art in visual object retrieval from large databases is achieved by systems that are inspired by text retrieval. A key component of these approaches is that local regions of images are characterized using high-dimensional descriptors which are then mapped to ldquovisual wordsrdquo selected from a discrete vocabulary.This paper explores techniques to map each visual region to a weighted set of words, allowing the inclusion of features which were lost in the quantization stage of previous systems. The set of visual words is obtained by selecting words based on proximity in descriptor space. We describe how this representation may be incorporated into a standard tf-idf architecture, and how spatial verification is modified in the case of this soft-assignment. We evaluate our method on the standard Oxford Buildings dataset, and introduce a new dataset for evaluation. Our results exceed the current state of the art retrieval performance on these datasets, particularly on queries with poor initial recall where techniques like query expansion suffer. Overall we show that soft-assignment is always beneficial for retrieval with large vocabularies, at a cost of increased storage requirements for the index.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587635.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lost in quantization: Improving particular object retrieval in large scale image databases","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Information retrieval","Image retrieval","Large-scale systems","Image databases","Visual databases","Architecture","Buildings","Vocabulary","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-based retrieval","image retrieval","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large scale image databases","visual object retrieval","high-dimensional descriptor","visual words","quantization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Lost in quantization: Improving particular object retrieval in large scale image databases","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587635/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139940","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lost in quantization: Improving particular object retrieval in large scale image databases","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"295.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051796S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"813","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4587637,"authors":[{"name":"Ariadna Quattoni","affiliation":["MIT CSAIL, USA"],"firstName":"Ariadna","lastName":"Quattoni","id":"37829080100"},{"name":"Michael Collins","affiliation":["MIT CSAIL, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Collins","id":"37272162300"},{"name":"Trevor Darrell","affiliation":["MIT CSAIL, USA","University of California, Berkeley EECS & ICSI, USA"],"firstName":"Trevor","lastName":"Darrell","id":"37282910600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587637","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":116,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1706},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image classification","Prototypes","Kernel","Learning systems","Optimization methods","Computer vision","Semisupervised learning","Boosting","Approximation methods","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","linear programming","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transfer learning","image classification","kernel function","joint loss minimization","linear program"]}],"abstract":"To learn a new visual category from few examples, prior knowledge from unlabeled data as well as previous related categories may be useful. We develop a new method for transfer learning which exploits available unlabeled data and an arbitrary kernel function; we form a representation based on kernel distances to a large set of unlabeled data points. To transfer knowledge from previous related problems we observe that a category might be learnable using only a small subset of reference prototypes. Related problems may share a significant number of relevant prototypes; we find such a concise representation by performing a joint loss minimization over the training sets of related problems with a shared regularization penalty that minimizes the total number of prototypes involved in the approximation. This optimization problem can be formulated as a linear program that can be solved efficiently. We conduct experiments on a news-topic prediction task where the goal is to predict whether an image belongs to a particular news topic.

By using Principal Component Analysis to align the principal axes of the data with the coordinate axes, we have further increased the KD-treepsilas search performance.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587638","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587638.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimised KD-trees for fast image descriptor matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587638/","displayDocTitle":"Optimised KD-trees for fast image descriptor matching","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139943","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587638/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimised KD-trees for fast image descriptor matching","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082179S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"308","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4587639,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Torsello","affiliation":["Dipartimento di informatica, Universit\u00e0 E2809CCaFoscariE2809D di Venezia, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Torsello","id":"37393080200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587639","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Shape","Parameter estimation","Electric shock","Training data","Graphical models","Explosions","Computer vision","Layout","Concrete"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","image recognition","image representation","image sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling approach","shape structural representations","learning archetypal structural models","graph generative model","independent Bernoulli trials","parameter estimation","Delaunay graph","shock graphs","image features"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587639","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587639.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An importance sampling approach to learning structural representations of shape","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of learning archetypal structural models from examples.

The parameters are estimated maximizing the likelihood of the observed graphs, marginalizing it over all possible node correspondences. This is done adopting an importance sampling approach to limit the exponential explosion of the set of correspondences.

As we demonstrate in this paper, however, image sparse representation is sensitive to image plane transformations such that existing approaches can not reconstruct the sparse representation of a geometrically transformed image. We introduce a simple technique for obtaining transformation-invariant image sparse representation. It is rooted in two observations: 1) if the aligned model images of an object span a linear subspace, their transformed versions with respect to some group of transformations can still span a linear subspace in a higher dimension; 2) if a target (or test) image, aligned with the model images, lives in the above subspace, its pre-alignment versions would get closer to the subspace after applying estimated transformations with more and more accurate parameters. These observations motivate us to project a potentially unaligned target image to random projection manifolds defined by the model images and the transformation model. Each projection is then separated into the aligned projection target and a residue due to misalignment. The desired aligned projection target is then iteratively optimized by gradually diminishing the residue. In this framework, we can simultaneously recover the sparse representation of a target image and the image plane transformation between the target and the model images. We have applied the proposed methodology to two applications: face recognition, and dynamic texture registration. The improved performance over previous methods that we obtain demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587640","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587640.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous image transformation and sparse representation recovery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous image transformation and sparse representation recovery","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587640/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139945","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587640/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous image transformation and sparse representation recovery","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068168S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587643,"authors":[{"name":"Robby T.

Optically, this is due to the substantial presence of particles in the atmosphere that absorb and scatter light. In computer vision, the absorption and scattering processes are commonly modeled by a linear combination of the direct attenuation and the airlight. Based on this model, a few methods have been proposed, and most of them require multiple input images of a scene, which have either different degrees of polarization or different atmospheric conditions. This requirement is the main drawback of these methods, since in many situations, it is difficult to be fulfilled. To resolve the problem, we introduce an automated method that only requires a single input image. This method is based on two basic observations: first, images with enhanced visibility (or clear-day images) have more contrast than images plagued by bad weather; second, airlight whose variation mainly depends on the distance of objects to the viewer, tends to be smooth. Relying on these two observations, we develop a cost function in the framework of Markov random fields, which can be efficiently optimized by various techniques, such as graph-cuts or belief propagation. The method does not require the geometrical information of the input image, and is applicable for both color and gray images.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587643","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587643.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visibility in bad weather from a single image","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587643/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Visibility in bad weather from a single image","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10139948","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587643/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visibility in bad weather from a single image","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06784S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"1089","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4587645,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaofeng He","affiliation":["Center for Biometrics and Security Research, National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition,National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhaofeng He","id":"37654953600"},{"name":"Zhenan Sun","affiliation":["Center for Biometrics and Security Research, National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition,National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhenan Sun","id":"37280349600"},{"name":"Tieniu Tan","affiliation":["Center for Biometrics and Security Research, National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition,National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Tieniu Tan","id":"37274122900"},{"name":"Xianchao Qiu","affiliation":["Center for Biometrics and Security Research, National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition,National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xianchao Qiu","id":"37275009800"},{"name":"Cheng Zhong","affiliation":["Center for Biometrics and Security Research, National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition,National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Cheng Zhong","id":"37647212500"},{"name":"Wenbo Dong","affiliation":["Center for Biometrics and Security Research, National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition,National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wenbo Dong","id":"37396034300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587645","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":420},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boosting","Iris recognition","Image databases","Spatial databases","Machine learning algorithms","Large-scale systems","Helium","Sun","Biometrics","National security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","encoding","eye","image recognition","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ordinal features boosting","iris representation method","regional ordinal measure encoding","similarity oriented boosting algorithm","Adaboost","SOBoost","cascade architecture","iris image databases","state-of-the-art iris recognition accuracy","iris databases"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel iris recognition method based on learned ordinal features.Firstly, taking full advantages of the properties of iris textures, a new iris representation method based on regional ordinal measure encoding is presented, which provides an over-complete iris feature set for learning.

Compared with Adaboost, SOBoost is advantageous in that it operates on similarity oriented training samples, and therefore provides a better way for boosting strong classifiers. Finally, the well-known cascade architecture is adopted to reorganize the learned SOBoost classifier into a dasiacascadepsila, by which the searching ability of iris recognition towards large-scale deployments is greatly enhanced. Extensive experiments on two challenging iris image databases demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art iris recognition accuracy and speed.

We approach this problem from the perspective of compressed sensing. The low-resolution image is viewed as downsampled version of a high-resolution image, whose patches are assumed to have a sparse representation with respect to an over-complete dictionary of prototype signal-atoms. The principle of compressed sensing ensures that under mild conditions, the sparse representation can be correctly recovered from the downsampled signal. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of sparsity as a prior for regularizing the otherwise ill-posed super-resolution problem. We further show that a small set of randomly chosen raw patches from training images of similar statistical nature to the input image generally serve as a good dictionary, in the sense that the computed representation is sparse and the recovered high-resolution image is competitive or even superior in quality to images produced by other SR methods.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587647","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587647.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image super-resolution as sparse representation of raw image patches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587647/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Image super-resolution as sparse representation of raw image patches","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587647/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139952","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image super-resolution as sparse representation of raw image patches","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078342S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"258","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4587652,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Mairal","affiliation":["INRIA, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Mairal","id":"37298504700"},{"name":"Francis Bach","affiliation":["INRIA, France"],"firstName":"Francis","lastName":"Bach","id":"37281561400"},{"name":"Jean Ponce","affiliation":["Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, USA"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Ponce","id":"37282647000"},{"name":"Guillermo Sapiro","affiliation":["University of Minnesota, USA"],"firstName":"Guillermo","lastName":"Sapiro","id":"37274814000"},{"name":"Andrew Zisserman","affiliation":["Oxford University, UK"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Zisserman","id":"37266140000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587652","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":430,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":2889},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Image analysis","Image reconstruction","Image restoration","Signal restoration","Image segmentation","Image databases","Image texture analysis","Focusing","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","image restoration","image segmentation","image texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminative learned dictionaries","local image analysis","sparse signal models","video restoration","image restoration","signal restoration","local image discrimination","dictionary learning","energy formulation","texture segmentation experiments","Brodatz database","scene analysis","scene recognition framework","reconstructive dictionaries"]}],"abstract":"Sparse signal models have been the focus of much recent research, leading to (or improving upon) state-of-the-art results in signal, image, and video restoration.

In the past, such a decomposition was obtained mostly in an unsupervised manner, such as Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and its variants, and hence unnecessary to be powerful at classification. In this work, the non-negative data decomposition is studied in a unified way applicable for both unsupervised and supervised/semi-supervised configurations. The ultimate data decomposition is separated into two parts, which separatively preserve the similarities measured by the intrinsic and penalty graphs, and together minimize the data reconstruction error. An iterative procedure is derived for such a purpose, and the algorithmic non-negativity is guaranteed by the non-negative property of the inverse of any M-matrix. Extensive experiments compared with NMF and conventional solutions for graph embedding demonstrate the algorithmic properties in sparsity, classification power, and robustness to image occlusions.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587665.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-negative graph embedding","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Non-negative graph embedding","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139970","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587665/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-negative graph embedding","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075057S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587670,"authors":[{"name":"Ameet Talwalkar","affiliation":["Courant Institute, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ameet","lastName":"Talwalkar","id":"38093471400"},{"name":"Sanjiv Kumar","affiliation":["Google Research, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjiv","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38183554700"},{"name":"Henry Rowley","affiliation":["Google Research, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"Rowley","id":"37294882200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587670","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":81,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1072},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Large-scale systems","Laplace equations","Sparse matrices","Matrix decomposition","Sampling methods","Principal component analysis","Image sampling","Learning systems","Iterative methods","Spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","face recognition","graph theory","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale manifold learning","high-dimensional face images","nonlinear dimensionality reduction","Isomap","Laplacian Eigenmaps","Nystrom approximation","column-sampling method"]}],"abstract":"This paper examines the problem of extracting low-dimensional manifold structure given millions of high-dimensional face images. Specifically, we address the computational challenges of nonlinear dimensionality reduction via Isomap and Laplacian Eigenmaps, using a graph containing about 18 million nodes and 65 million edges. Since most manifold learning techniques rely on spectral decomposition, we first analyze two approximate spectral decomposition techniques for large dense matrices (Nystrom and column-sampling), providing the first direct theoretical and empirical comparison between these techniques. We next show extensive experiments on learning low-dimensional embeddings for two large face datasets: CMU-PIE (35 thousand faces) and a web dataset (18 million faces). Our comparisons show that the Nystrom approximation is superior to the column-sampling method. Furthermore, approximate Isomap tends to perform better than Laplacian Eigenmaps on both clustering and classification with the labeled CMU-PIE dataset.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587670.pdf","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-scale manifold learning","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587670","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587670","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Large-scale manifold learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587670/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10139975","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587670/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-scale manifold learning","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"330.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064968S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4587672,"authors":[{"name":"O.

However, stereo reconstruction using global inference algorithms, such as graph-cuts, has not been able to incorporate second-order priors because the triple cliques needed to express them yield intractable (non-submodular) optimization problems. This paper shows that inference with triple cliques can be effectively optimized. Our optimization strategy is a development of recent extensions to a-expansion, based on the \"QPBO\" algorithm [5, 14, 26]. The strategy is to repeatedly merge proposal depth maps using a novel extension of QPBO. Proposal depth maps can come from any source, for example fronto-parallel planes as in a-expansion, or indeed any existing stereo algorithm, with arbitrary parameter settings. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of the second-order prior and the efficacy of our optimization framework. An implementation of our stereo framework is available online [34].","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587672","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587672.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global stereo reconstruction under second order smoothness priors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Global stereo reconstruction under second order smoothness priors","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587672/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139977","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587672/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global stereo reconstruction under second order smoothness priors","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086532S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4587673,"authors":[{"name":"Engin Tola","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Computer Vision Laboratory, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Engin","lastName":"Tola","id":"37397908600"},{"name":"Vincent Lepetit","affiliation":["\u00c9cole PolytechniqueF\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Computer Vision Laboratory, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Lepetit","id":"37281250600"},{"name":"Pascal Fua","affiliation":["\u00c9cole PolytechniqueF\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Computer Vision Laboratory, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Fua","id":"37281288800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587673","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":294,"citationCountPatent":27,"totalDownloads":2622},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Robustness","Yield estimation","Layout","Pixel","Histograms","Computational efficiency","Computer vision","Laboratories","Feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","estimation theory","graph theory","image matching","image reconstruction","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast local image descriptor","dense wide-baseline matching","graph-cuts-based dense depth map estimation algorithm","correlation window","image quality","image resolution","image reconstruction"]}],"abstract":"We introduce a novel local image descriptor designed for dense wide-baseline matching purposes. We feed our descriptors to a graph-cuts based dense depth map estimation algorithm and this yields better wide-baseline performance than the commonly used correlation windows for which the size is hard to tune. As a result, unlike competing techniques that require many high-resolution images to produce good reconstructions, our descriptor can compute them from pairs of low-quality images such as the ones captured by video streams. Our descriptor is inspired from earlier ones such as SIFT and GLOH but can be computed much faster for our purposes. Unlike SURF which can also be computed efficiently at every pixel, it does not introduce artifacts that degrade the matching performance. Our approach was tested with ground truth laser scanned depth maps as well as on a wide variety of image pairs of different resolutions and we show that good reconstructions are achieved even with only two low quality images.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587673","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587673.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast local descriptor for dense matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587673/","displayDocTitle":"A fast local descriptor for dense matching","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10139978","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587673/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast local descriptor for dense matching","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062471S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"294","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4587677,"authors":[{"name":"Federico Tombari","affiliation":["Advanced Research Center on Electronic Systems (ARCES), University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Tombari","id":"37593332100"},{"name":"Stefano Mattoccia","affiliation":["Universita di Bologna, Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, IT"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Mattoccia","id":"37326275100"},{"name":"Luigi Di Stefano","affiliation":["Universita di Bologna, Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, IT"],"firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Di Stefano","id":"37299189400"},{"name":"Elisa Addimanda","affiliation":["Universita di Bologna, Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, IT"],"firstName":"Elisa","lastName":"Addimanda","id":"38093285000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587677","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":124,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1364},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cost function","Computational efficiency","Robustness","Performance evaluation","Computational complexity","Computer science","Standards development","Pixel","Taxonomy","Belief propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost aggregation classification","cost aggregation evaluation","cost aggregation method","stereo correspondence"]}],"abstract":"In the last decades several cost aggregation methods aimed at improving the robustness of stereo correspondence within local and global algorithms have been proposed.

Our technique drastically reduces the number of parameters that are considered, resulting in dramatic speedups, while provably approximating the covariance of the full set of parameters. To compute a skeletal image set, we first estimate the accuracy of two-frame reconstructions between pairs of overlapping images, then use a graph algorithm to select a subset of images that, when reconstructed, approximates the accuracy of the full set.

We use the low-rank shape model, i.e. the 3D shape is represented as a linear combination of unknown shape bases. We propose a new way of looking at the low-rank shape model. Instead of considering it as a whole, we assume a coarse-to-fine ordering of the deformation modes, which can be seen as a model prior. This has several advantages. First, the high level of ambiguity of the original low-rank shape model is drastically reduced since the shape bases can not anymore be arbitrarily re-combined. Second, this allows us to propose a coarse-to-fine reconstruction algorithm which starts by computing the mean shape and iteratively adds deformation modes. It directly gives the sought after metric model, thereby avoiding the difficult upgrading step required by most of the other methods. Third, this makes it possible to automatically select the number of deformation modes as the reconstruction algorithm proceeds. We propose to incorporate two other priors, accounting for temporal and spatial smoothness, which are shown to improve the quality of the recovered model parameters. The proposed model and reconstruction algorithm are successfully demonstrated on several videos and are shown to outperform the previously proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587694.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coarse-to-fine low-rank structure-from-motion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Reconstruction algorithms","Deformable models","Videos","Cameras","Computer vision","Principal component analysis","Terminology","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deformable shape","motion recovery","multiple perspective images","low-rank shape model","coarse-to-fine ordering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Coarse-to-fine low-rank structure-from-motion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587694/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587694/","accessionNumber":"10139999","publicationDate":"June 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coarse-to-fine low-rank structure-from-motion","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048095S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":4587706,"authors":[{"name":"C.

We innovatively formulate the problem as the computation of Manifold-Manifold Distance (MMD), i.e., calculating the distance between nonlinear manifolds each representing one image set. To compute MMD, we also propose a novel manifold learning approach, which expresses a manifold by a collection of local linear models, each depicted by a subspace. MMD is then converted to integrating the distances between pair of subspaces respectively from one of the involved manifolds. The proposed MMD method is evaluated on the task of Face Recognition based on Image Set (FRIS). In FRIS, each known subject is enrolled with a set of facial images and modeled as a gallery manifold, while a testing subject is modeled as a probe manifold, which is then matched against all the gallery manifolds by MMD. Identification is achieved by seeking the minimum MMD. Experimental results on two public face databases, Honda/UCSD and CMU MoBo, demonstrate that the proposed MMD method outperforms the competing methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587719.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587719","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Manifold-Manifold Distance with application to face recognition based on image set","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Probes","Image converters","Content addressable storage","Testing","Cameras","Image storage","Video sequences","Image recognition","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manifold-manifold distance","MMD","face recognition","FRIS","manifold learning approach","public face databases","Honda/UCSD","CMU MoBo","image set"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Manifold-Manifold Distance with application to face recognition based on image set","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587719/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140023","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Manifold-Manifold Distance with application to face recognition based on image set","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086982S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587721,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Thurau","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technical University Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Thurau","id":"37671378400"},{"name":"Vaclav Hlavac","affiliation":["Center for Machine Perception, Czech Technical University, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Vaclav","lastName":"Hlavac","id":"37426728100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587721","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":177,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1544},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Image recognition","Videos","Histograms","Image sequences","Target recognition","Legged locomotion","Shape","Detectors","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image sequences","pose estimation","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pose primitives","human action recognition","still images","histogram of oriented gradient","HOG","n-gram expressions","mainstream video surveillance"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a method for recognizing human actions based on pose primitives.

Action classes are represented by histograms of poses primitives. For sequences, we incorporate the local temporal context by means of n-gram expressions.

A video sequence is represented by a bag of spatiotemporal features called video-words by quantizing the extracted 3D interest points (cuboids) from the videos. Our proposed approach is able to automatically discover the optimal number of video-word clusters by utilizing maximization of mutual information(MMI). Unlike the k-means algorithm, which is typically used to cluster spatiotemporal cuboids into video words based on their appearance similarity, MMI clustering further groups the video-words, which are highly correlated to some group of actions. To capture the structural information of the learnt optimal video-word clusters, we explore the correlation of the compact video-word clusters. We use the modified correlogram, which is not only translation and rotation invariant, but also somewhat scale invariant. We extensively test our proposed approach on two publicly available challenging datasets: the KTH dataset and IXMAS multiview dataset. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to try the bag of video-words related approach on the multiview dataset. We have obtained very impressive results on both datasets.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587723","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587723.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning human actions via information maximization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587723","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning human actions via information maximization","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587723/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140027","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587723/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning human actions via information maximization","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061009S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4587727,"authors":[{"name":"Mikel D.

Our approach is based on a maximum average correlation height (MACH) filter. A common limitation of template-based methods is their inability to generate a single template using a collection of examples. MACH is capable of capturing intra-class variability by synthesizing a single Action MACH filter for a given action class. We generalize the traditional MACH filter to video (3D spatiotemporal volume), and vector valued data. By analyzing the response of the filter in the frequency domain, we avoid the high computational cost commonly incurred in template-based approaches. Vector valued data is analyzed using the Clifford Fourier transform, a generalization of the Fourier transform intended for both scalar and vector-valued data. Finally, we perform an extensive set of experiments and compare our method with some of the most recent approaches in the field by using publicly available datasets, and two new annotated human action datasets which include actions performed in classic feature films and sports broadcast television.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587727","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587727.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Action MACH a spatio-temporal Maximum Average Correlation Height filter for action recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587727/","displayDocTitle":"Action MACH a spatio-temporal Maximum Average Correlation Height filter for action recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140031","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587727/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Action MACH a spatio-temporal Maximum Average Correlation Height filter for action recognition","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050771S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"638","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4587730,"authors":[{"name":"Konrad Schindler","affiliation":["BIWI, ETH, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Konrad","lastName":"Schindler","id":"37267277500"},{"name":"Luc van Gool","affiliation":["ESAT-K.U.

This framework is a joint optimization over an undeformed tissue volume, a deformation map that describes tissue motion forgiven pose parameters (i.e. breathing and heartbeat), and an estimate of those parameters for each data acquisition. Tissue motion is modeled by deforming a reference volume with a cubic B-spline free form deformation, and we use Isomap to derive initial estimates of the pose of sample data. An iterative method is used to simultaneously solve for the reference volume and deformation map while updating the pose estimates. This same process is demonstrated on 4D CT lung data and heart/lung MR data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lungs","Motion estimation","Computed tomography","Deformable models","Slabs","Image reconstruction","Data acquisition","Heart beat","Parameter estimation","Spline"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","computational geometry","lung","solid modelling","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simultaneous data volume reconstruction","pose estimation","slice samples","heart dynamics","lung tissue dynamics","data driven framework","complete reconstruction","deforming tissue volumes","deformation map","tissue motion","cubic B-spline free form deformation","Isomap"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587740","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587740.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous data volume reconstruction and pose estimation from slice samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous data volume reconstruction and pose estimation from slice samples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587740/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587740/","accessionNumber":"10140044","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous data volume reconstruction and pose estimation from slice samples","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052387S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4587743,"authors":[{"name":"Verena Kaynig","affiliation":["Electron Microscopy, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Verena","lastName":"Kaynig","id":"37548033700"},{"name":"Bernd Fischer","affiliation":["Institute of Computational Science, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Fischer","id":"38087569400"},{"name":"Joachim M.

In this paper we demonstrate a fully automatic stitching and distortion correction method for TEM images and propose a probabilistic approach for image registration. The technique identifies image defects due to sample preparation and image acquisition by outlier detection. A polynomial kernel expansion is used to estimate a non-linear image transformation based on intensities and spatial features. Corresponding points in the images are not determined beforehand, but they are estimated via an EM-algorithm during the registration process which is preferable in the case of (noisy) TEM images. Our registration model is successfully applied to two large image stacks of serial section TEM images acquired from brain tissue samples in a computational neuroanatomy project and shows significant improvement over existing image registration methods on these large datasets.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587743","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587743.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587743","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic image registration and anomaly detection by nonlinear warping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic image registration and anomaly detection by nonlinear warping","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587743/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587743/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140047","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic image registration and anomaly detection by nonlinear warping","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065418S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4587751,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Lempitsky","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Lempitsky","id":"37332794000"},{"name":"Stefan Roth","affiliation":["Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Roth","id":"37282906600"},{"name":"Carsten Rother","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Rother","id":"37326487100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587751","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":100,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":742},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image motion analysis","Optical saturation","Statistics","Optimization methods","State estimation","Stereo vision","Iterative algorithms","Fuses","Image sequences","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","graph theory","image fusion","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FusionFlow","discrete-continuous optimization","optical flow estimation","energy optimization problems","narrow-baseline stereo matching","graph cuts","message-passing","minimum cuts","continuous-valued fusion","local gradient descent"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587751","abstract":"Accurate estimation of optical flow is a challenging task, which often requires addressing difficult energy optimization problems. To solve them, most top-performing methods rely on continuous optimization algorithms. The modeling accuracy of the energy in this case is often traded for its tractability. This is in contrast to the related problem of narrow-baseline stereo matching, where the top-performing methods employ powerful discrete optimization algorithms such as graph cuts and message-passing to optimize highly non-convex energies. In this paper, we demonstrate how similar non-convex energies can be formulated and optimized discretely in the context of optical flow estimation. Starting with a set of candidate solutions that are produced by fast continuous flow estimation algorithms, the proposed method iteratively fuses these candidate solutions by the computation of minimum cuts on graphs. The obtained continuous-valued fusion result is then further improved using local gradient descent. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed energy is an accurate model and that the proposed discrete-continuous optimization scheme not only finds lower energy solutions than traditional discrete or continuous optimization techniques, but also leads to flow estimates that outperform the current state-of-the-art.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587751","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587751.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FusionFlow: Discrete-continuous optimization for optical flow estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"FusionFlow: Discrete-continuous optimization for optical flow estimation","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587751/","accessionNumber":"10140055","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587751/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FusionFlow: Discrete-continuous optimization for optical flow estimation","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085668S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":4587754,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Bilal Ashraf","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed Bilal","lastName":"Ashraf","id":"37390936600"},{"name":"Simon Lucey","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Lucey","id":"37266130100"},{"name":"Tsuhan Chen","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"lastName":"Tsuhan Chen","id":"37276683300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587754","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":370},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Probes","Humans","Deformable models","Lighting","Image recognition","Head","Geometry","Nose","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["patch correspondences","viewpoint invariant face recognition","alignment strategy","stackflow","spatial deformation"]}],"abstract":"Variation due to viewpoint is one of the key challenges that stand in the way of a complete solution to the face recognition problem. It is easy to note that local regions of the face change differently in appearance as the viewpoint varies. Recently, patch-based approaches, such as those of Kanade and Yamada, have taken advantage of this effect resulting in improved viewpoint invariant face recognition. In this paper we propose a data-driven extension to their approach, in which we not only model how a face patch varies in appearance, but also how it deforms spatially as the viewpoint varies. We propose a novel alignment strategy which we refer to as ldquostack flowrdquo that discovers viewpoint induced spatial deformities undergone by a face at the patch level. One can then view the spatial deformation of a patch as the correspondence of that patch between two viewpoints. We present improved identification and verification results to demonstrate the utility of our technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning patch correspondences for improved viewpoint invariant face recognition","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587754","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587754.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Learning patch correspondences for improved viewpoint invariant face recognition","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587754/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140058","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning patch correspondences for improved viewpoint invariant face recognition","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077791S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587756,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Laptev","affiliation":["INRIA Rennes, IRISA, France"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Laptev","id":"37270740700"},{"name":"Marcin Marszalek","affiliation":["INRIA Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Marszalek","id":"37891667500"},{"name":"Cordelia Schmid","affiliation":["LEAR-LJK"],"firstName":"Cordelia","lastName":"Schmid","id":"37282990700"},{"name":"Benjamin Rozenfeld","affiliation":["Bar-llan University, Israel"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Rozenfeld","id":"37833087100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587756","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2027,"citationCountPatent":20,"totalDownloads":6736},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Motion pictures","Image recognition","Video sharing","Layout","Text categorization","Object recognition","Robustness","Clothing","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cinematography","image classification","image retrieval","learning (artificial intelligence)","support vector machines","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video realistic human action recognition","movie script","automatic video annotation","human action retrieval","text-based classifier","visual learning","video action classification","local space-time feature","space-time pyramid","multichannel nonlinear SVM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587756","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587756.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587756","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning realistic human actions from movies","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to address recognition of natural human actions in diverse and realistic video settings. This challenging but important subject has mostly been ignored in the past due to several problems one of which is the lack of realistic and annotated video datasets. Our first contribution is to address this limitation and to investigate the use of movie scripts for automatic annotation of human actions in videos. We evaluate alternative methods for action retrieval from scripts and show benefits of a text-based classifier. Using the retrieved action samples for visual learning, we next turn to the problem of action classification in video. We present a new method for video classification that builds upon and extends several recent ideas including local space-time features, space-time pyramids and multi-channel non-linear SVMs. The method is shown to improve state-of-the-art results on the standard KTH action dataset by achieving 91.8% accuracy. Given the inherent problem of noisy labels in automatic annotation, we particularly investigate and show high tolerance of our method to annotation errors in the training set. We finally apply the method to learning and classifying challenging action classes in movies and show promising results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587756/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10140060","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587756/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Learning realistic human actions from movies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning realistic human actions from movies","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074047S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"2027","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4587761,"authors":[{"name":"Jiejie Zhu","affiliation":["Center for Visualization and Virtual Environments, University of Kentucky, USA"],"lastName":"Jiejie Zhu","id":"37088151098"},{"name":"Liang Wang","affiliation":["Center for Visualization and Virtual Environments, University of Kentucky, USA"],"lastName":"Liang Wang","id":"37087155309"},{"name":"Ruigang Yang","affiliation":["Center for Visualization and Virtual Environments, University of Kentucky, USA"],"lastName":"Ruigang Yang","id":"37087199475"},{"name":"James Davis","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Santa Cruz, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Davis","id":"38183303700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587761","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":61,"totalDownloads":2594},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusion of time-of-flight depth and stereo for high accuracy depth maps","abstract":"Time-of-flight range sensors have error characteristics which are complementary to passive stereo. They provide real time depth estimates in conditions where passive stereo does not work well, such as on white walls. In contrast, these sensors are noisy and often perform poorly on the textured scenes for which stereo excels. We introduce a method for combining the results from both methods that performs better than either alone. A depth probability distribution function from each method is calculated and then merged. In addition, stereo methods have long used global methods such as belief propagation and graph cuts to improve results, and we apply these methods to this sensor. Since time-of-flight devices have primarily been used as individual sensors, they are typically poorly calibrated. We introduce a method that substantially improves upon the manufacturerpsilas calibration. We show that these techniques lead to improved accuracy and robustness.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587761","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587761.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stereo vision","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Calibration","Layout","Probability distribution","Belief propagation","Manufacturing","Robustness","Application software","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","sensor fusion","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-of-flight depth fusion","high accuracy depth maps","time-of-flight range sensors","complementary-to-passive stereo","textured scenes","depth probability distribution function","belief propagation","graph cuts"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fusion of time-of-flight depth and stereo for high accuracy depth maps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587761/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587761/","accessionNumber":"10140065","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusion of time-of-flight depth and stereo for high accuracy depth maps","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK","sourcePdf":"421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057866S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4587765,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Vincent Gehler","affiliation":["Max-Planck Institute, Tubingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter Vincent","lastName":"Gehler","id":"37398104000"},{"name":"Carsten Rother","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Rother","id":"37326487100"},{"name":"Andrew Blake","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Blake","id":"37282602200"},{"name":"Tom Minka","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Minka","id":"37295104200"},{"name":"Toby Sharp","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Toby","lastName":"Sharp","id":"37408379000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587765","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":181,"citationCountPatent":18,"totalDownloads":946},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587765","abstract":"Computational color constancy is the task of estimating the true reflectances of visible surfaces in an image. In this paper we follow a line of research that assumes uniform illumination of a scene, and that the principal step in estimating reflectances is the estimation of the scene illuminant. We review recent approaches to illuminant estimation, firstly those based on formulae for normalisation of the reflectance distribution in an image - so-called grey-world algorithms, and those based on a Bayesian formulation of image formation. In evaluating these previous approaches we introduce a new tool in the form of a database of 568 high-quality, indoor and outdoor images, accurately labelled with illuminant, and preserved in their raw form, free of correction or normalisation. This has enabled us to establish several properties experimentally. Firstly automatic selection of grey-world algorithms according to image properties is not nearly so effective as has been thought. Secondly, it is shown that Bayesian illuminant estimation is significantly improved by the improved accuracy of priors for illuminant and reflectance that are obtained from the new dataset.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Layout","Reflectivity","Lighting","Testing","Cameras","Image databases","Object recognition","Image resolution","Yield estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","image colour analysis","lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian color constancy","computational color constancy","illumination","scene illuminant","grey-world algorithm","image formation","Bayesian illuminant estimation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587765","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587765.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian color constancy revisited","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bayesian color constancy revisited","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10140069","publicationDate":"June 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587765/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian color constancy revisited","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050345S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"181","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4587781,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Vedaldi","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Vedaldi","id":"37398040100"},{"name":"Gregorio Guidi","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Gregorio","lastName":"Guidi","id":"37926809500"},{"name":"Stefano Soatto","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Soatto","id":"37282915600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587781","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Entropy","Power generation","Computer science","Lattices","Code standards","Measurement standards","Image coding","Lighting","Image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deformation","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint data alignment","lossy transformation","data simplification process","data complexity measure","natural image","discount domain deformation","codebook"]}],"abstract":"Joint data alignment is often regarded as a data simplification process. This idea is powerful and general, but raises two delicate issues. First, one must make sure that the use full information about the data is preserved by the alignment process. This is especially important when data are affected by non-invertible transformations, such as those originating from continuous domain deformations in a discrete image lattice. We propose a formulation that explicitly avoids this pitfall. Second, one must choose an appropriate measure of data complexity. We show that standard concepts such as entropy might not be optimal for the task, and we propose alternative measures that reflect the regularity of the codebook space. We also propose a novel and efficient algorithm that allows joint alignment of a large number of samples (tens of thousands of image patches), and does not rely on the assumption that pixels are independent. This is done for the case where the data is postulated to live in an affine subspaces of the embedding space of the raw data. We apply our scheme to learn sparse bases for natural images that discount domain deformations and hence significantly decrease the complexity of codebooks while maintaining the same generative power.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587781","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587781.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint data alignment up to (lossy) transformations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587781/","displayDocTitle":"Joint data alignment up to (lossy) transformations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140085","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587781/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint data alignment up to (lossy) transformations","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.139675S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587783,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Unger","affiliation":["Computer Aided Medical Procedures (CAMP), Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Unger","id":"38236678900"},{"name":"Martin Groher","affiliation":["Computer Aided Medical Procedures (CAMP), Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Groher","id":"37662180600"},{"name":"Nassir Navab","affiliation":["Computer Aided Medical Procedures (CAMP), Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Nassir","lastName":"Navab","id":"37282965500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587783","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Motion compensation","Catheters","Tensile stress","Navigation","X-ray imaging","Anatomy","Image reconstruction","Visualization","Bones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angiocardiography","medical image processing","motion compensation","rendering (computer graphics)","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image based rendering","2D angiographic roadmapping","fluoroscopic images","rigid patient motion compensation","trifocal tensor","vascular rendering"]}],"abstract":"2D angiographic roadmapping is used frequently during image guided interventions to superimpose vessel structures onto currently acquired fluoroscopic images.

The emergence of vast amounts of geographically-calibrated image data is a great reason for computer vision to start looking globally - on the scale of the entire planet! In this paper, we propose a simple algorithm for estimating a distribution over geographic locations from a single image using a purely data-driven scene matching approach. For this task, we leverage a dataset of over 6 million GPS-tagged images from the Internet. We represent the estimated image location as a probability distribution over the Earthpsilas surface. We quantitatively evaluate our approach in several geolocation tasks and demonstrate encouraging performance (up to 30 times better than chance). We show that geolocation estimates can provide the basis for numerous other image understanding tasks such as population density estimation, land cover estimation or urban/rural classification.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587784.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IM2GPS: estimating geographic information from a single image","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer vision","Layout","Earth","Surface topography","Humans","Probability distribution","Sea surface","Global Positioning System","Planets","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","geography","image matching","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IM2GPS","geographic information estimation","computer vision problem","geographically-calibrated image data","scene matching approach","GPS-tagged images","Internet","image location estimation","probability distribution","Earth surface","geolocation tasks","population density estimation","land cover estimation","urban classification","rural classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"IM2GPS: estimating geographic information from a single image","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587784/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140088","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IM2GPS: estimating geographic information from a single image","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043826S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"442","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4587799,"authors":[{"name":"Carolina Galleguillos","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Carolina","lastName":"Galleguillos","id":"37393565700"},{"name":"Andrew Rabinovich","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Rabinovich","id":"37838629400"},{"name":"Serge Belongie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Serge","lastName":"Belongie","id":"37326607300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587799","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":281,"citationCountPatent":17,"totalDownloads":1351},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Object recognition","Image segmentation","Context modeling","Computer science","Prototypes","Face detection","Lighting","Psychology","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object categorization","local appearance-based features","cooccurrence location appearance","conditional random field","object label agreement","semantic-spatial relevance","pairwise features","PASCAL 2007","CoLA","CRF","prototypical spatial relationships"]}],"abstract":"In this work we introduce a novel approach to object categorization that incorporates two types of context-co-occurrence and relative location - with local appearance-based features.

However, to our best knowledge no previous work has focused on utilizing local patterns for the task of human detection. In this paper we develop a novel human detection system in personal albums based on LBP (local binary pattern) descriptor. Firstly we review the existing gradient based local features widely used in human detection, analyze their limitations and argue that LBP is more discriminative. Secondly, original LBP descriptor does not suit the human detecting problem well due to its high complexity and lack of semantic consistency, thus we propose two variants of LBP: Semantic-LBP and Fourier-LBP. Carefully designed experiments demonstrate the superiority of LBP over other traditional features for human detection. Especially we adopt a random ensemble algorithm for better comparison between different descriptors.

A major problem hindering the development of CLMs further, for non-rigid object alignment/tracking, is how to jointly optimize the global warp update across all local search responses. Previous methods have either used general purpose optimizers (e.g., simplex methods) or graph based optimization techniques. Unfortunately, problems exist with both these approaches when applied to CLMs. In this paper, we propose a new approach for optimizing the global warp update in an efficient manner by enforcing convexity at each local patch response surface. Furthermore, we show that the classic Lucas-Kanade approach to gradient descent image alignment can be viewed as a special case of our proposed framework. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach receives improved performance for the task of non-rigid face alignment/tracking on the MultiPIE database and the UNBC-McMaster archive.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587808","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587808.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enforcing convexity for improved alignment with constrained local models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enforcing convexity for improved alignment with constrained local models","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587808/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140112","pubMedId":"20622926","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587808/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enforcing convexity for improved alignment with constrained local models","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"468.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.17111S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4587810,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo H.

In this work, we propose a new procedure for recognition of low-resolution faces, when there is a high-resolution training set available. Most previous super-resolution approaches are aimed at reconstruction, with recognition only as an after-thought. In contrast, in the proposed method, face features, as they would be extracted for a face recognition algorithm (e.g., eigenfaces, Fisher-faces, etc.), are included in a super-resolution method as prior information. This approach simultaneously provides measures of fit of the super-resolution result, from both reconstruction and recognition perspectives. This is different from the conventional paradigms of matching in a low-resolution domain, or, alternatively, applying a super-resolution algorithm to a low-resolution face and then classifying the super-resolution result. We show, for example, that recognition of faces of as low as 6 times 6 pixel size is considerably improved compared to matching using a super-resolution reconstruction followed by classification, and to matching with a low-resolution training set.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous super-resolution and feature extraction for recognition of low-resolution faces","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587810","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587810.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous super-resolution and feature extraction for recognition of low-resolution faces","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587810/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140114","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous super-resolution and feature extraction for recognition of low-resolution faces","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"470.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056833S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587816,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"lastName":"Yue Zhou","id":"37288677400"},{"name":"Shuicheng Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Shuicheng Yan","id":"37272225300"},{"name":"Thomas S.

First, we design a set of features, e.g., causality ratio and feedback ratio based on the Granger Causality Test (GCT), for describing the pair-activities encoded as trajectory pairs. These features along with conventional velocity and position features are essentially of multi-modalities, and may be greatly different in scale and importance. To make full use of them, we then present a novel feature normalization procedure to learn the coefficients for weighting these features by maximizing the discriminating power measured by weighted correlation. Finally, we collected a pair-activity database of five categories, each of which consists of about 170 instances. The extensive experiments on this database validate the effectiveness of the designed features for pair-activity representation, and also demonstrate that the proposed feature normalization procedure greatly boosts the pair-activity classification accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587816","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587816.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pair-activity classification by bi-trajectories analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pair-activity classification by bi-trajectories analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587816/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140119","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587816/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pair-activity classification by bi-trajectories analysis","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071931S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4587821,"authors":[{"name":"Siwei Lyu","affiliation":["Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and Center for Neuroscience, New York University, USA"],"lastName":"Siwei Lyu","id":"37087219866"},{"name":"Eero P.

Previous dual motion deblurring algorithms succeeded in small and simple motion blur and are very sensitive to noise. We develop a robust feedback algorithm to perform iteratively kernel estimation and image deblurring. In kernel estimation, the stability and capability of the algorithm is greatly improved by incorporating a robust cost function and a set of kernel priors. The robust cost function serves to reject outliers and noise, while kernel priors, including sparseness and continuity, remove ambiguity and maintain kernel shape. In deblurring, we propose a novel and robust approach which takes two blurred images as input to infer the clear image. The deblurred image is then used as feedback to refine kernel estimation. Our method can successfully estimate large and complex motion blurs which cannot be handled by previous dual or single image motion deblurring algorithms. The results are shown to be significantly better than those of previous approaches.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise robustness","Kernel","Iterative algorithms","Feedback","Robust stability","Cost function","Cameras","Image restoration","Noise shaping","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","feedback","image motion analysis","image restoration","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust algorithm","blurred photos","camera shaking","dual motion deblurring algorithms","robust feedback algorithm","iteratively kernel estimation","image deblurring","blurred images","deblurred image","image motion deblurring algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587830","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587830.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust dual motion deblurring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust dual motion deblurring","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587830/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587830/","accessionNumber":"10140134","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust dual motion deblurring","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05527S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4587834,"authors":[{"name":"Neel Joshi","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Neel","lastName":"Joshi","id":"37270908500"},{"name":"Richard Szeliski","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Szeliski","id":"37282879100"},{"name":"David J.

We present an algorithm that estimates non-parametric, spatially-varying blur functions (i.e., point-spread functions or PSFs) at subpixel resolution from a single image. Our method handles blur due to defocus, slight camera motion, and inherent aspects of the imaging system. Our algorithm can be used to measure blur due to limited sensor resolution by estimating a sub-pixel, super-resolved PSF even for in-focus images. It operates by predicting a ldquosharprdquo version of a blurry input image and uses the two images to solve for a PSF. We handle the cases where the scene content is unknown and also where a known printed calibration target is placed in the scene. Our method is completely automatic, fast, and produces accurate results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587834.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PSF estimation using sharp edge prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Image resolution","Kernel","Image sensors","Spatial resolution","Layout","Cameras","Calibration","Pixel","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","image resolution","image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sharp edge prediction","image blur","antialiasing filters","camera sensor","limited sensor resolution","spatially-varying blur functions","subpixel resolution","camera motion","imaging system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"PSF estimation using sharp edge prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587834/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140138","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PSF estimation using sharp edge prediction","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"494.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042617S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"340","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4587837,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Prati","affiliation":["Di.S.M.I, University of Modena, Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Prati","id":"37267335000"},{"name":"Simone Calderara","affiliation":["D.I.I, University of Modena, Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Calderara","id":"37541444900"},{"name":"Rita Cucchiara","affiliation":["D.I.I, University of Modena, Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Rita","lastName":"Cucchiara","id":"37271902200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587837","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":466},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistical analysis","Pattern analysis","Clustering algorithms","Distributed computing","Shape measurement","Probability","US Department of Transportation","Surveillance","Iterative algorithms","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","expectation-maximisation algorithm","statistical distributions","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circular statistics","trajectory shape analysis","movement pattern analysis","surveillance application","Von Mises distribution","expectation maximization algorithm","dynamic programming"]}],"abstract":"The analysis of patterns of movement is a crucial task for several surveillance applications, for instance to classify normal or abnormal people trajectories on the basis of their occurrence.

The MSF characterizes the spatial co-occurrence of histogram patterns by Markov chain models, and finally yields a compact feature representation through Markov stationary analysis. Therefore, the MSF goes one step beyond histograms since it now involves spatial structure information of both within histogram bins and between histogram bins. Moreover, it still keeps simplicity, compactness, efficiency, and robustness. We demonstrate how the MSF is used to extend histogram based features like color histogram, edge histogram, local binary pattern histogram and histogram of oriented gradients. We evaluate the MSF extended histogram features on the task of TRECVID video concept detection. Results show that the proposed MSF extensions can achieve significant performance improvement over corresponding histogram features.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587839.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One step beyond histograms: Image representation using Markov stationary features","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Image representation","Image edge detection","Image analysis","Image retrieval","Pattern analysis","Machine vision","Spatial resolution","Image resolution","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image representation","Markov processes","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image representation","Markov stationary features","MSF","Markov chain models","color histogram","edge histogram","local binary pattern histogram","TRECVID video concept detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"One step beyond histograms: Image representation using Markov stationary features","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587839/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140143","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One step beyond histograms: Image representation using Markov stationary features","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"499.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.376349S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4587841,"authors":[{"name":"Prateek Jain","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Prateek","lastName":"Jain","id":"37533769800"},{"name":"Brian Kulis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Kulis","id":"37397827700"},{"name":"Kristen Grauman","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Kristen","lastName":"Grauman","id":"37282612200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587841","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":155,"citationCountPatent":20,"totalDownloads":763},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image databases","Spatial databases","Extraterrestrial measurements","Kernel","Indexing","Image representation","Data structures","Digital images","Computer vision","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","database indexing","image coding","image retrieval","vectors","very large databases","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image searching","pairwise similarity constraints","dissimilarity constraints","Mahalanobis distance function","learned metric parameterization encoding","randomized locality-sensitive hash functions","vector spaces","learned distances indexing","very large databases indexing"]}],"abstract":"We introduce a method that enables scalable image search for learned metrics.

Our learned metrics improve accuracy relative to commonly-used metric baselines, while our hashing construction enables efficient indexing with learned distances and very large databases.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587841","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587841.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast image search for learned metrics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587841","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast image search for learned metrics","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587841/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140145","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587841/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast image search for learned metrics","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090723S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"155","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587842,"authors":[{"name":"Denis Simakov","affiliation":["Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"],"firstName":"Denis","lastName":"Simakov","id":"37563095300"},{"name":"Yaron Caspi","affiliation":["Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"],"firstName":"Yaron","lastName":"Caspi","id":"37282625400"},{"name":"Eli Shechtman","affiliation":["Adobe Systems, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Eli","lastName":"Shechtman","id":"37282591600"},{"name":"Michal Irani","affiliation":["Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Irani","id":"37282593100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587842","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":348,"citationCountPatent":33,"totalDownloads":1980},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bidirectional control","Pixel","Image generation","Signal synthesis","Video sequences","Large screen displays","Image resolution","Region 3","Image segmentation","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual data summarization","bidirectional similarity","well-defined similarity measure","image-video data","visual summary","object removal","visual data synthesis","image collage","automatic cropping"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587842","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587842","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","abstract":"We propose a principled approach to summarization of visual data (images or video) based on optimization of a well-defined similarity measure. The problem we consider is re-targeting (or summarization) of image/video data into smaller sizes. A good ldquovisual summaryrdquo should satisfy two properties: (1) it should contain as much as possible visual information from the input data; (2) it should introduce as few as possible new visual artifacts that were not in the input data (i.e., preserve visual coherence). We propose a bi-directional similarity measure which quantitatively captures these two requirements: Two signals S and T are considered visually similar if all patches of S (at multiple scales) are contained in T, and vice versa. The problem of summarization/re-targeting is posed as an optimization problem of this bi-directional similarity measure. We show summarization results for image and video data. We further show that the same approach can be used to address a variety of other problems, including automatic cropping, completion and synthesis of visual data, image collage, object removal, photo reshuffling and more.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587842.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Summarizing visual data using bidirectional similarity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587842/","displayDocTitle":"Summarizing visual data using bidirectional similarity","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140146","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Summarizing visual data using bidirectional similarity","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054711S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"348","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4587843,"authors":[{"name":"Fatih Porikli","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Fatih","lastName":"Porikli","id":"37283409500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587843","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":220,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":1773},"abstract":"This paper presents three novel methods that enable bilateral filtering in constant time O(1) without sampling. Constant time means that the computation time of the filtering remains same even if the filter size becomes very large. Our first method takes advantage of the integral histograms to avoid the redundant operations for bilateral filters with box spatial and arbitrary range kernels. For bilateral filters constructed by polynomial range and arbitrary spatial filters, our second method provides a direct formulation by using linear filters of image powers without any approximation. Lastly, we show that Gaussian range and arbitrary spatial bilateral filters can be expressed by Taylor series as linear filter decompositions without any noticeable degradation of filter response. All these methods drastically decrease the computation time by cutting it down constant times (e.g. to 0.06 seconds per 1MB image) while achieving very high PSNRpsilas over 45 dB. In addition to the computational advantages, our methods are straightforward to implement.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587843.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant time O(1) bilateral filtering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear filters","Histograms","Kernel","Surface treatment","Taylor series","Filtering algorithms","Polynomials","Smoothing methods","Convolution","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","filtering theory","Gaussian processes","image sampling","series (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["O(1) bilateral filtering","integral histograms","polynomial range","arbitrary spatial filters","linear filters","Gaussian range","spatial bilateral filters","Taylor series","linear filter decompositions","filter response degradation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587843/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Constant time O(1) bilateral filtering","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4587843/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140147","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant time O(1) bilateral filtering","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106009S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"220","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":4587846,"authors":[{"name":"Manmohan Chandraker","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Manmohan","lastName":"Chandraker","id":"37397476800"},{"name":"David Kriegman","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Kriegman","id":"37269726900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2242-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2243-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4587846","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":336},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer vision","Application software","Shape","Cameras","Image reconstruction","Singular value decomposition","Large-scale systems","Face detection","Machine vision","Surface reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","convergence","convex programming","face recognition","image motion analysis","image reconstruction","image representation","linear programming","minimisation","relaxation theory","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal bilinear programming","computer vision","convex relaxations","objective function minimisation","branch and bound framework","convergent branching strategy","exemplar-based face reconstruction","nonrigid structure","shape representation"]}],"abstract":"We present a practical algorithm that provably achieves the global optimum for a class of bilinear programs commonly arising in computer vision applications. Our approach relies on constructing tight convex relaxations of the objective function and minimizing it in a branch and bound framework. A key contribution of the paper is a novel, provably convergent branching strategy that allows us to solve large-scale problems by restricting the branching dimensions to just one set of variables constituting the bilinearity. Experiments with synthetic and real data validate our claims of optimality, speed and convergence. We contrast the optimality of our solutions with those obtained by a traditional singular value decomposition approach. Among several potential applications, we discuss two: exemplar-based face reconstruction and non-rigid structure from motion. In both cases, we compute the best bilinear fit that represents a shape, observed in a single image from an arbitrary viewpoint, as a combination of the elements of a basis.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587846","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4558014/4587335/04587846.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587335","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Globally optimal bilinear programming for computer vision applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4587846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Globally optimal bilinear programming for computer vision applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587846/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140150","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587846/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Globally optimal bilinear programming for computer vision applications","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063678S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4558014","isNumber":"4587335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4558014","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4587335","articleId":"4587846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4587869,"authors":[{"name":"Sangchoon Kim","affiliation":["Hadan 2-dong, Dong-A University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sangchoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37404958100"},{"name":"Sunyoung Baek","affiliation":["Hadan 2-dong, Dong-A University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sunyoung","lastName":"Baek","id":"37829373400"},{"name":"Jinyoung An","affiliation":["Hadan 2-dong, Dong-A University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinyoung","lastName":"An","id":"37392664600"},{"name":"Kyoungsoo Son","affiliation":["Hadan 2-dong, Dong-A University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyoungsoo","lastName":"Son","id":"38079610400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1458-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1459-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-3994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-4001"}],"articleNumber":"4587869","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Array signal processing","Receiving antennas","Multiaccess communication","US Department of Defense","Transmitting antennas","Performance analysis","Antenna arrays","Linear antenna arrays","Phased arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","MIMO communication","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamformer-based acquisition","MIMO-CDMA communication systems","MIMO channel","ML code acquisition technique","transmit beamforming","receive beamforming","detection probability","MAT","MIMO code acquisition system","multiple transmit antennas","SIMO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)","Beamforming","Code Acquisition","CDMA"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes the code acquisition scheme on a MIMO channel for preamble search in a MIMO-CDMA uplink system.

To the knowledge of the authors this is the first implementation of an GF(q) LDPC decoder for high order fields (q \u2265 64). The originality of the proposed architecture is that it takes into account the memory problem of the NB-LDPC decoders, together with a significant complexity reduction per decoding iteration which becomes independent from the field's order. The error decoding performance of the low complexity algorithm with proper compensation has been obtained through computer simulations. The frame error rate results are quite good with respect to the important complexity reduction. The results prove also that an implementation of a NB-LDPC decoder is now feasible and the extra complexity of the decoder is balanced by the superior performance of this class of codes. With their foreseen simple architectures and good-error correcting performances, NB-LDPC codes provides a promising vehicle for real-life efficient coding system implementations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Hardware","Medical services","AWGN","Iterative algorithms","Computer architecture","Computer errors","Computer simulation","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction","error statistics","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity nonbinary LDPC decoder","EMS decoding algorithm","complexity reduction per decoding iteration","frame error rate"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4587847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCE.2008.4587946","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"2008 Digest of Technical Papers - International Conference on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Digest of Technical Papers - International Conference on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4542560/4587847/04587946.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCE.2008.4587946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture of a Low-Complexity Non-Binary LDPC Decoder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Architecture of a Low-Complexity Non-Binary LDPC Decoder","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10118174","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4587946/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4587946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture of a Low-Complexity Non-Binary LDPC Decoder","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCE-00-99.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049842S","chronDate":"9-13 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4542560","isNumber":"4587847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4542560","xplore-issue":"4587847","articleId":"4587946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4587980,"authors":[{"name":"Takahiro Tsugi","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, Tokyo University of Science, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Tsugi","id":"38094218700"},{"name":"Makoto Itami","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, Tokyo University of Science, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Itami","id":"37284644000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1458-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1459-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-3994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-4001"}],"articleNumber":"4587980","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation coding","OFDM modulation","Error correction codes","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Frequency domain analysis","Zinc","Additive noise","Quadrature phase shift keying","Convolutional codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","carrier transmission on power lines","channel coding","error correction codes","frequency-domain analysis","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","precoded OFDM","error correcting code","transmission scheme","frequency domain","subcarrier independent adaptive modulation scheme","allocation information transmission","power-line channels"]}],"abstract":"In OFDM transmission, it is possible to adoptively control transmission scheme of each sub-carrier according to the transmission channel because each sub-carrier in OFDM is orthogonally arranged in frequency domain.

In order to evaluate reliability, tests must be performed under conditions that are much more severe than those expected under normal use in order to obtain failure statistics in reasonable times. These tests only make sense if the extrapolated lifetimes and failure distributions can be extrapolated back to use conditions, so that assessments of the reliability under normal operation can be made. The simple use of the traditional Blackpsilas Law for EM and either the E or 1/E model for TDDB can be shown not to provide accurate projections of product lifetime in the light of recent knowledge of the failure mechanisms. In this paper, the most recently developed techniques for extrapolating test data to use conditions will be described with suggestions for determining operational reliability performance.","doi":"10.1109/IPFA.2008.4588207","publicationTitle":"2008 15th International Symposium on the Physical and Failure Analysis of Integrated Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th International Symposium on the Physical and Failure Analysis of Integrated Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579686/4588140/04588207.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPFA.2008.4588207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4588140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New models for interconnect failure in advanced IC technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4588207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4588207/","displayDocTitle":"New models for interconnect failure in advanced IC technology","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10140590","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4588207/","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New models for interconnect failure in advanced IC technology","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"IPFA2008_11-0.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042299S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579686","isNumber":"4588140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579686","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4588140","articleId":"4588207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4588242,"authors":[{"name":"Qiuhua Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4603104/4588242/4588242-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiuhua Liu (S'02\u2013M'08) was born in Shandong, China.

Semi supervised learning algorithms are designed using both labeled and unlabeled data, where here labeled data correspond to sensor signatures for which the identity of the buried item (UXO/non-UXO) is known; for unlabeled data, one only has access to the corresponding sensor data. Active learning is used to define which unlabeled signatures would be most informative to improve the classifier design if the associated label could be acquired (where for UXO sensing, the label is acquired by excavation). A graph-based semi supervised algorithm is applied, which employs the idea of a random Markov walk on a graph, thereby exploiting knowledge of the data manifold (where the manifold is defined by both the labeled and unlabeled data). The algorithm is used to infer labels for the unlabeled data, providing a probability that a given unlabeled signature corresponds to a buried UXO. An efficient active-learning procedure is developed for this algorithm, based on a mutual information measure. In this manner, one initially performs excavation with the purpose of acquiring labels to improve the classifier, and once this active-learning phase is completed, the resulting semi supervised classifier is then applied to the remaining unlabeled signatures to quantify the probability that each such item is a UXO. Example classification results are presented for an actual UXO site, based on electromagnetic induction and magnetometer data. Performance is assessed in comparison to other semi supervised approaches, as well as to supervised algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.920468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.920468","startPage":"2558","endPage":"2567","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4603104/04588242.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Unexploded Ordnance via Efficient Semisupervised and Active Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Unexploded Ordnance via Efficient Semisupervised and Active Learning","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","volume":"46","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4588242/","accessionNumber":"10177369","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4588242/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Unexploded Ordnance via Efficient Semisupervised and Active Learning","sourcePdf":"46tgrs09-carin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131588S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4603104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4603104","articleId":"4588242","onlineDate":"04 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4588243,"authors":[{"name":"Boon Leng Cheong","affiliation":["School of Meteorology, University of Oklahama, Norman, OK, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4603104/4588243/4588243-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Boon Leng Cheong received the B.S.E.E., M.S.E.E., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, in 1999, 2002, and 2005, respectively.","Since 2005, he has been a Postdoctoral Fellow with the School of Meteorology, University of Oklahoma, Norman.

The retrieval technique utilizes radar phase measurements of ground clutter to derive near-surface refractivity, which has been commonly used as a proxy for humidity, given its close relation to vapor pressure. Surface humidity is an important meteorological parameter and has been known to play an important role in convective initiation. In this paper, the refractivity retrieval technique is exploited by using smaller numbers of samples for phase calculation, which is a fundamental process in refractivity retrieval. The impetus for this paper is to explore the possibility of rapid refractivity retrieval by exploiting the rapid beam-steering capability of a phased-array radar. Using the National Weather Radar Testbed in Norman, OK, a 64-pulse per radial raw-data set was collected for conventional refractivity processing. Then, subsets of the 64 samples were extracted to emulate shorter dwell periods and the corresponding more rapid experiments. The test cases that were considered are 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 samples. Refractivity fields retrieved using smaller numbers of samples are compared against the reference field, which was obtained using the entire 64-sample data set. It will be shown that, statistically, significant refractivity fields can be obtained from as short as a two-sample dwell.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.919506","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4603104/04588243.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.919506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603104","startPage":"2527","endPage":"2537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Refractivity Retrieval Using the Phased-Array Radar: First Results and Potential for Multimission Operation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4588243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Refractivity Retrieval Using the Phased-Array Radar: First Results and Potential for Multimission Operation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4588243/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10177371","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4588243/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Refractivity Retrieval Using the Phased-Array Radar: First Results and Potential for Multimission Operation","sourcePdf":"46tgrs09-cheong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079928S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4603104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4603104","articleId":"4588243","onlineDate":"04 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4588329,"authors":[{"name":"Suman Sarkar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4588326/4588329/4588329-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Suman Sarkar (S'04) received M.S. degree in computer science from University of California, Davis, in 2005, where he is currently working toward Ph.D. Suman is a Research Assistant with the Networks Research Lab, UC Davis.

By confining the tree search into candidates which can be selected in an adaptive manner, a large number of promising candidates can be evaluated before termination. Consequently, the proposed P-SD improves the error performance of DF-SD with early termination, while retaining the hardware efficiency. An efficient VLSI architecture is proposed for implementation of the P-SD algorithm, and the results of the synthesized architecture are presented. The main advantage of P-SD is that it can fully exploit the state-of-the-art architectures of DF-SD, since it can be implemented by simply adding two functional blocks to conventional DF-SD. By analyzing the performance-complexity tradeoffs, it is concluded that our proposed P-SD is advantageous over conventional DF-SD and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>\n-best algorithm, when the maximum-likelihood error performance is desired.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Spherical Detection and VLSI Implementation for Multiple-Antenna Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2002544","startPage":"685","endPage":"698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2002544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4799355/04588347.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4588347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4588347/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Spherical Detection and VLSI Implementation for Multiple-Antenna Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4588347/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10623935","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Spherical Detection and VLSI Implementation for Multiple-Antenna Systems","sourcePdf":"tcsi-park-2002544.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091611S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4799355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4799355","articleId":"4588347","onlineDate":"04 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4588348,"authors":[{"name":"Kang Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4799355/4588348/4588348-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kang Li (M'05) received the B.Sc. degree from Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, China, in 1989, the M.Sc. degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 1992, and the Ph.D. degree from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 1995.","He is currently a Senior Lecturer in intelligent systems and control with the School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, U.K. Prior to his appointment, he held various research or academic posts at Shanghai Jiaotong University, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands, and Queen's University Belfast.

Given a model selection criterion, the main objective is to effectively and efficiently build a parsimonious compact neural model that generalizes well over unseen data. This is achieved by simultaneous model structure selection and optimization of the parameters over the continuous parameter space. It is a mixed-integer hard problem, and a unified analytic framework is proposed to enable an effective and efficient two-stage mixed discrete-continuous identification procedure. This novel framework combines the advantages of an iterative discrete two-stage subset selection technique for model structure determination and the calculus-based continuous optimization of the model parameters.

The results show that the noise from the virtual ground threshold detection comparator dominates the overall ADC noise performance. The noise from the charging current can also be significant, depending on the size of the capacitors used, but the contribution was small in the prototype. The other noise sources have contributions comparable to those in op-amp-based designs, and their effects can be managed through appropriate design. In the prototype, folded flicker noise was found to be a significant contributor to the broadband noise because the flicker noise of the comparator extends beyond the Nyquist rate of the converter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4588350/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","volume":"56","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10543363","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4588350/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Noise Analysis for Comparator-Based Circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Analysis for Comparator-Based Circuits","sourcePdf":"tcsi-sepke-2002547.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081543S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4799355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4799355","articleId":"4588350","onlineDate":"04 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4588351,"authors":[{"name":"Timmy Sundstrom","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4799355/4588351/4588351-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Timmy Sundstr\u00f6m (S'07) received the M.Sc. degree in applied physics and electrical engineering from Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden, in 2005, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in the Department of Electrical Engineering.","Since March 2006, he has been a Member of the electronic devices research group of the Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University.

ADC power dissipation has been examined several times, mostly empirically. In this paper, we present an attempt to estimate a lower bound for the power of ADCs, based on first principles and using pipeline and flash architectures as examples. We find that power dissipation of high-resolution ADCs is bound by noise, whereas technology is the limiting factor for low-resolution devices. Our model assumes the use of digital error correction, but we also study an example on the power penalty due to matching requirements. A comparison with published experimental data indicates that the best ADCs use about 50 times the estimated minimum power. Two published ADCs are used for a more detailed comparison between the minimum bound and today's designs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4588351/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","volume":"56","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10543364","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4588351/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Power Dissipation Bounds for High-Speed Nyquist Analog-to-Digital Converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Dissipation Bounds for High-Speed Nyquist Analog-to-Digital Converters","sourcePdf":"tcsi-sundstrom-2002548.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123221S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4799355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"4799355","articleId":"4588351","onlineDate":"04 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4588354,"authors":[{"name":"Nitin Mohan","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Boxborough, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4799355/4588354/4588354-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nitin Mohan (S'01\u2013M'07) received the B.Tech. degree (with honors) in electronics engineering from the Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India, in 1999 and the M.A.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.","From 1999 to 2000, he was with Wipro Technologies, working on the design and verification of field-programmable gate arrays.

The proposed technique employs an early/late block to detect the rising and falling edges of the pulses generated by intersignal timing skews at the far end of channels and, subsequently, allocates the optimal sampling point of the sampler of each data bit to maximize the timing margins. Two cascaded delay-locked loops (DLLs) are employed to place the sampling clock to the optimal sampling position of each data bit. The skew-compensation ranges are determined from the delay ranges of the DLLs. The effectiveness of the proposed deskewing method is validated using a parallel link with data rate of 1 GB/s and four microstrip channels on an FR4 substrate. The data link is implemented in UMC-0.13-mum 1.2-V CMOS technology and analyzed using SpectreRF from Cadence Design Systems with BSIM3v3 device models.

In order to reduce the amount of those distortions, a new method has been developed for partial elimination of out-of-band emissions by preprocessing signal in digital domain prior to orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal construction.","doi":"10.1109/ITI.2008.4588500","startPage":"723","endPage":"728","displayPublicationTitle":"ITI 2008 - 30th International Conference on Information Technology Interfaces","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578606/4588363/04588500.pdf","publicationTitle":"ITI 2008 - 30th International Conference on Information Technology Interfaces","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITI.2008.4588500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4588363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elimination of out-of-band emissions in Digital Radio Mondiale transmissions using the genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Modulation","Radio transmitters","Bandwidth","Biological cells","Distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital radio","genetic algorithms","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["out-of-band emission elimination","digital radio Mondiale transmissions","genetic algorithm","nonlinear transmitters","out-of-band emissions","spectral mask","digital signal modulation characteristics","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","OFDM signal construction","digital domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["digital radio","signal processing","genetic algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4588500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Elimination of out-of-band emissions in Digital Radio Mondiale transmissions using the genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4588500/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10140508","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elimination of out-of-band emissions in Digital Radio Mondiale transmissions using the genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Cavtat, Croatia","sourcePdf":"111-07-032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034767S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578606","isNumber":"4588363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578606","xplore-issue":"4588363","articleId":"4588500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SRCE University","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4588553,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

They are: 1) the write-and-verify (WAV) writing of four-level resistance states; and 2) the moderate-quenched (MQ) writing of intermediate resistance levels, 3) the optimization of temporal resistance increase (so-called resistance drift) and 4) of resistance increase after thermal annealing. With taking into account of them, we realized a two-bit cell operation in diode-switch phase change memory cells with 90 nm technology.

Good device characteristics are achieved through two innovative processes: (1) a low-energy tilt-angle STI pocket implantation to suppress the STI corner edge effect, and (2) a drain offset using an additional oxide liner to improve the short-channel effect. The conventional self-boosting program-inhibit and ISPP (incremental step pulse programming) for MLC storage are demonstrated for 20 nm BE-SONOS NAND operation. Read current stability and read disturb life time are also evaluated. The estimated number of storage electrons is only 50-100, and for the first time we have demonstrated successful data retention after 150degC baking in the ldquofew-electronrdquo regime.

Junction-free devices greatly improve the short channel effect and thus promise scaling of NAND Flash below 20 nm node. Instead of S/D junctions a very small space (Lt 30 nm) is left between adjacent devices. Junction is formed only at the outer region of NAND array, while there is no junction inside the array. Fringe field from the gate inverts the Si under the narrow space allowing conduction without a diffusion junction. Successful n-channel, p-channel and TFT BE-SONOS NAND devices are demonstrated using this technique. Simulation results suggest that this novel junction-free technique is scalable beyond 20 nm node. Moreover, the junction-free devices are unaffected by the thermal budget in the 3D TFT devices.

DCL technique is a novel Stress Memorization Technique (SMT). We successfully improved the short channel effect (SCE) with keeping a high drive current by FLA in Ni-silicidation. For pMOSFET, 2 layers Ni Fully-silicide (Ni-FUSI) was selectively formed on gates, and both effective work function (WF) control and thinner Teff are improved.

Among the different techniques proposed to alleviate this problem, the discrete-time cellular neural network (DT-CNN) has been proved to be a powerful tool as it has the advantage of a feasible hardware implementation that can significantly speed up the computations. In this paper a thermal model of the soil based on the solution of the heat equation has been adapted to a multilayer DT-CNN architecture. Thus, we emulate the dynamic of a multilayer DT-CNN on an FPGA platform using Handel-C and VHDL. An speedup factor of 34 over a PC is achieved, which demonstrates the utility of such an implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4573176/4588621/04588642.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"16","publicationTitle":"2008 11th International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their Applications","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.2008.4588642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.2008.4588642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4588621","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4588642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DT-CNN emulator: 3D heat equation solver with applications on the non-destructive soil inspection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Soil","Mathematical model","Field programmable gate arrays","Registers","Nonhomogeneous media","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","field programmable gate arrays","geophysics computing","nondestructive testing","soil"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D heat equation solver","nondestructive soil inspection","physical phenomena modelling","discrete-time cellular neural network","Handel-C","VHDL"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Application accelerator","DT-CNN","Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)","hardware accelerator","integer arithmetic","Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4588642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"DT-CNN emulator: 3D heat equation solver with applications on the non-destructive soil inspection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4588642/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10140423","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"14-16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DT-CNN emulator: 3D heat equation solver with applications on the non-destructive soil inspection","confLoc":"Santiago de Composteia, Spain","sourcePdf":"session1paper1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054352S","chronDate":"14-16 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4573176","isNumber":"4588621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4573176","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4588621","articleId":"4588642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4588643,"authors":[{"name":"Suleyman Malki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Suleyman","lastName":"Malki","id":"37265811600"},{"name":"Lambert Spaanenburg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Lambert","lastName":"Spaanenburg","id":"37265812600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2089-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2090-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0144"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-0152"}],"articleNumber":"4588643","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Computer architecture","Pixel","Registers","Boundary conditions","Pipelines","Network interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural networks","reliable communication","secure communication","local network control","internal network communication","feature extraction task","hand vein recognition"]}],"abstract":"Digital implementations of Cellular Neural Networks are studied in terms of their communication requirements.

This architecture intends to process video images real time with 3times3 CNN templates and without the use of an external memory. The absence of the external memory decreases the cost and complexity of the system. The architecture is based on a single pipelined cell which is employed to emulate a CNN with larger number of neurons. The video source must transmit the data to the FPGA in a progressive manner like the VGA, DVI, progressive cameras or digital interfaced CMOS cameras. Interlaced video signals like PAL, SECAM and NTSC are not suitable for this architecture. The video image pixels are processed and outputted simultaneously with the incoming pixel values. The output signal of the system is synchronized to the input signal with some video line latency, where latency is due to the pipelined structure of the system. Proposed architecture is also realized on a Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA in Celoxica RC203 board. The main features of the architecture are: 1) No external memory is required. 2) Computation of each pixel is done in three FPGA clock periods. 3) The number of Euler iterations required for the computation of the output values is determined by the number of implemented processor units (PUs).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4588644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10140425","htmlLink":"/document/4588644/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"14-16 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new approach to emulate CNN on FPGAs for real time video processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to emulate CNN on FPGAs for real time video processing","confLoc":"Santiago de Composteia, Spain","sourcePdf":"session1paper3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053394S","chronDate":"14-16 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4573176","isNumber":"4588621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4573176","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4588621","articleId":"4588644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4588645,"authors":[{"name":"Ramazan Yeniceri","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ramazan","lastName":"Yeniceri","id":"37397741100"},{"name":"Mustak E.

The method is an improvement of a previous method presented by the same authors. The method exploits the nonlinear dynamic behavior of cellular neural networks (CNNs), in particular the propagation of bipolar waves. The image is represented in polar form, transforming the symmetry with respect to an arbitrarily oriented axis in a vertical symmetry: the position of the vertical axis corresponds to the angle of the original symmetry axis. The parallel CNN architecture is useful to speed up the computation, because of the high computational cost of the task. The proposed algorithm is tested on many real images, with good results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their

The introduced graphical user interface uses Matlab Simulink with UMF-like program description, where direct functionality accompanies better accessability. The new generation of graphical cards incorporate many general purpose graphics processing units, giving the power of parallel computing to a simple PC environment cheaply. Therefore, analysis of CNN dynamics become more feasible with a common hardware setup. Our measurements demonstrate the efficiency of the realized system. In the case of simpler algorithms, real-time execution is also possible.","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.2008.4588671","publicationTitle":"2008 11th International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4573176/4588621/04588671.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.2008.4588671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4588621","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4588671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU powered CNN simulator (SIMCNN) with graphical flow based programmability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4588671/","displayDocTitle":"GPU powered CNN simulator (SIMCNN) with graphical flow based programmability","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4588671/","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"14-16 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10116979","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU powered CNN simulator (SIMCNN) with graphical flow based programmability","confLoc":"Santiago de Composteia, Spain","sourcePdf":"session7paper3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052935S","chronDate":"14-16 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4573176","isNumber":"4588621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4573176","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4588621","articleId":"4588671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4588672,"authors":[{"name":"Sandor Kocsardi","affiliation":["Department of Image Processing and Neurocomputing, University of Pannonia, Veszprem, Hungary"],"firstName":"Sandor","lastName":"Kocsardi","id":"37294544000"},{"name":"Zoltan Nagy","affiliation":["Cellular Sensory and Wave Computing Laboratory,Computer and Automation Research Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (ATOMKI), Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Zoltan","lastName":"Nagy","id":"37289561100"},{"name":"Arpad Csik","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computational Sciences, S\u017aechenyi Istv\u00e1n University, Gyor, Hungary"],"firstName":"Arpad","lastName":"Csik","id":"38196619600"},{"name":"Peter Szolgay","affiliation":["Cellular Sensory and Wave Computing Laboratory,Computer and Automation Research Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (ATOMKI), Budapest, Hungary","Faculty of Information Technology, P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter Catholic University, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Szolgay","id":"37294347300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2089-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2090-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0144"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-0152"}],"articleNumber":"4588672","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional Compressible Flow Simulation on Emulated Digital CNN-UM","abstract":"In the area of mechanical, aerospace, chemical and civil engineering the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) has been one of the most important problems of mathematics for a long time. In this field, one of the most exciting areas is the simulation of fluid flow, which involves for example problems of air, sea and land vehicle motion. In this paper a CNN-UM based solver of 2D inviscid, adiabatic, compressible fluids will be presented. The governing equations are solved by using first- and second-order numerical methods. Unfortunately the necessity the coupled multi-layered computational structure with non-linear, space-variant templates does not make it possible to utilize the huge computing power of the analog CNN-UM chips. To improve the performance of our solution emulated digital CNN-UM implemented on FPGA has been used. Properties of the implemented specialized architecture is examined in terms of area, speed and accuracy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Equations","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Field programmable gate arrays","Computational modeling","Magnetic cores"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","compressible flow","computational fluid dynamics","field programmable gate arrays","flow simulation","partial differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional compressible fluid flow simulation","emulated digital CNN-UM","partial differential equation","PDE","numerical method","FPGA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4588672","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.2008.4588672","startPage":"169","endPage":"174","publicationTitle":"2008 11th International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4573176/4588621/04588672.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4588621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.2008.4588672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4588672/","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional Compressible Flow Simulation on Emulated Digital CNN-UM","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 July 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10116980","htmlLink":"/document/4588672/","conferenceDate":"14-16 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional Compressible Flow Simulation on Emulated Digital CNN-UM","confLoc":"Santiago de Composteia, Spain","sourcePdf":"session7paper4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064355S","chronDate":"14-16 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4573176","isNumber":"4588621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4573176","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4588621","articleId":"4588672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4588673,"authors":[{"name":"Zsolt Voroshazi","affiliation":["Department of Image Processing and Neurocomputing, University of Pannonia, Veszprem, Hungary"],"firstName":"Zsolt","lastName":"Voroshazi","id":"37294510100"},{"name":"Andras Kiss","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter Catholic University, Hungary"],"firstName":"Andras","lastName":"Kiss","id":"37294343500"},{"name":"Zoltan Nagy","affiliation":["Cellular Sensory and Wave Computing Laboratory,Computer and Automation Research Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (ATOMKI), Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Zoltan","lastName":"Nagy","id":"37289561100"},{"name":"Peter Szolgay","affiliation":["Cellular Sensory and Wave Computing Laboratory,Computer and Automation Research Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (ATOMKI), Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Szolgay","id":"37294347300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2089-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2090-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0144"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-0152"}],"articleNumber":"4588673","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Process control","Random access memory","Vector processors","Mathematical model","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","image processing","neural net architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based emulated-digital CNN-UM","embedded GAPU","global analogic programming unit","cellular neural network","nonlinear network universal machine architecture","flexible Xilinx MicroBlaze soft-core processor","high-speed arithmetic","stand-alone operation","real image-processing task"]}],"abstract":"The paper addresses the issue of implementing a GAPU (global analogic programming unit) on the emulated-digital CNN-UM (cellular neural/nonlinear networks universal machine) architecture.

As regards its pattern formation capabilities, the system eigenvalues are studied and we show how template and circuit parameters can be varied in order to obtain dispersion curves with a desired shape. As shown, this allows one to select the unstable modes and therefore to control pattern formation.","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.2008.4588685","startPage":"242","endPage":"247","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4573176/4588621/04588685.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 11th International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.2008.4588685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4588621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular Neural Networks with second-order cells: Dynamics analysis and linear filtering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Band pass filters","IIR filters","Dispersion","Maximum likelihood detection","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Mathematical model","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","filtering theory","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural networks","second-order cells","dynamics analysis","image linear filtering","elementary processing unit","second-order dynamic system","state equations","pattern formation","system eigenvalues","dispersion curves"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4588685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cellular Neural Networks with second-order cells: Dynamics analysis and linear filtering","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4588685/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","conferenceDate":"14-16 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10140451","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular Neural Networks with second-order cells: Dynamics analysis and linear filtering","confLoc":"Santiago de Composteia, Spain","sourcePdf":"session10paper4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053101S","chronDate":"14-16 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4573176","isNumber":"4588621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4573176","xplore-issue":"4588621","articleId":"4588685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4588686,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto P.

The commonly used priority-based preemptive scheduling methods introduce jitter on task executions. This implies that the separation between consecutive starting times of a given control task is not constant. In the same time control theory assumes that sampling periods were constant. These variations on the sampling period of control task implementation can degrade the control system performance and in ultimately can induce instability in the system. In this paper, we present a practical approach to deal with sampling errors created by variations of sampling jitter thru appropriate variations of controller parameters.

The main aspects of their structure, kinematics, workspace, parameter design and optimization indices are introduced. A kinematic optimization was performed to maximize the workspace of the parallel robot. In order to perform an optimal design of 3 DOF parallel robots, an objective function was developed first, and then Genetic Algorithms applied for optimization.

The specific values of these parameters, corresponding to each evolution phase, will be estimated through statistical methods. We will focus on modeling the cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, but the normal state and chronic viral hepatitis (CVH) are also taken into consideration. The final purpose is that of providing a reliable method for non-invasive characterization of the evolution towards HCC, in order to prevent this malignant tumor.","doi":"10.1109/AQTR.2008.4588896","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Automation, Quality and Testing, Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Automation, Quality and Testing, Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578604/4588864/04588896.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AQTR.2008.4588896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4588864","startPage":"128","endPage":"133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring the textural parameters obtained from ultrasound images for modeling the liver pathological stages in the evolution towards hepatocellular carcinoma","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4588896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploring the textural parameters obtained from ultrasound images for modeling the liver pathological stages in the evolution towards hepatocellular carcinoma","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4588896/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 May 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10220967","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4588896/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring the textural parameters obtained from ultrasound images for modeling the liver pathological stages in the evolution towards hepatocellular carcinoma","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"032_Mitrea_Delia_-_Exploring_the_textural_paramet.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053586S","chronDate":"22-25 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578604","isNumber":"4588864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578604","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4588864","articleId":"4588896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4588957,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The vibration of the object gives rise to a frequency modulated, or Doppler, component in the scattered electromagnetic field. The Doppler component is primarily produced by two mechanisms, the boundary perturbation on the surface of the object and the density modulation within the object. The contributions from the boundary perturbation, which are analyzed in a previous publication, are reviewed and expanded upon herein; the contributions from density modulation are also presented. The wave interaction is analyzed with a unique, two-step approach. First, a finite element acoustic simulation is used to obtain the displacements within the acoustically excited object. This information is then input to a specialized formulation of the finite-difference time-domain method to simulate electromagnetic scattering. Analytical solutions for a cylinder are used to verify the computational modeling approach. Results for a more complex geometry are also presented.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.926746","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4589067/04589077.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.926746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4589067","startPage":"2191","endPage":"2199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Acousto-Electromagnetic Wave Interaction Using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4589077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Acousto-Electromagnetic Wave Interaction Using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4589077/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10144135","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4589077/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Acousto-Electromagnetic Wave Interaction Using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","sourcePdf":"56tap08-buerkle-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078747S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4589067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4589067","articleId":"4589077","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4589081,"authors":[{"name":"Graziano Cerri","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettromagnetismo e Bioingegneria, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4589069/4589081/4589081-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Graziano Cerri was born in Ancona, Italy, in 1956.

Many have difficulty handling interfaces between distinct dielectric media or metallic sheets, because the high-order Taylor expansions on which these codes are based are invalidated by field or derivative discontinuities. One-sided extensions/extrapolations are a common approach to remedy interface discontinuities. Here, another approach based upon Whitney form, mass lumped finite elements is pursued to develop the ldquoLobatto Cell,rdquo a high-order replacement for the Yee cell with appropriate continuity behavior at contrasting media interfaces. The Lobatto Cell retains many robust features of the Yee method (discrete conservation laws, a guarantee of conditional stability and straightforward explicit updating), but provides higher order interpolation and dispersion error convergence. A notable drawback of the method is larger modeling granularity (staircasing), which is managed here by combining the Lobatto Cell method with preexisting, robust subgridding techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.926758","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4589067/04589085.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.926758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4589067","startPage":"2167","endPage":"2177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Lobatto Cell: Robust, Explicit, Higher Order FDTD That Handles Inhomogeneous Media","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4589085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Lobatto Cell: Robust, Explicit, Higher Order FDTD That Handles Inhomogeneous Media","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4589085/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10144136","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4589085/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Lobatto Cell: Robust, Explicit, Higher Order FDTD That Handles Inhomogeneous Media","sourcePdf":"56tap08-chilton-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084789S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4589067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4589067","articleId":"4589085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4589095,"authors":[{"name":"Frederick Declercq","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4589069/4589095/4589095-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Frederick Declercq was born in 1983.

The paper starts with the finite element formulation of a generic antenna problem. Formulation for the modeling of general electrically and magnetically dispersive, lossy, and anisotropic materials in the time-domain finite element analysis is presented for the first time. This is followed by discussion of three typical techniques for truncation of the finite element computational domain via the use of absorbing boundary conditions, perfectly matched layers, and boundary integral equations. It then describes the modeling of antenna feeds using a current probe (including an improved model), a voltage gap, and a waveguide port boundary condition. After that, numerical approaches to modeling infinite phased arrays, large finite arrays, and antenna-platform interaction are presented, including two novel domain decomposition algorithms in both the frequency and time domains. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the capability and application of the finite element analysis of a variety of complex antennas and arrays.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4589110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2008","volume":"56","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"10144143","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4589110/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Finite Element Analysis of Complex Antennas and Arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite Element Analysis of Complex Antennas and Arrays","sourcePdf":"56tap08-jin-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.20013S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4589067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4589067","articleId":"4589110","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4589112,"authors":[{"name":"Will P.

The entire computational domain is divided into many smaller nonoverlapping subdomains. A Robin-type condition is introduced at the interfaces between subdomains to enforce the field continuity. With the help of a set of dual unknowns, each subdomain can be tackled independently. Because of geometric repetitions, all the sudomains can be classified into a few building blocks, which can be dealt with by an improved PBSV algorithm. Thus, the original problem becomes a much smaller one which involves the unknowns only at the interfaces. The resulting linear system of equations is solved by a block symmetric successive over relaxation (SSOR) preconditioned Krylov subspace method. Once the unknowns at the interfaces have been obtained, the final solution on each subdomain can easily be calculated independently. Some numerical examples are provided and show the method is scalable with the number of subdomains.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.926755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4589067/04589120.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.926755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4589067","startPage":"2200","endPage":"2210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Domain Decomposition Method for Solving Three-Dimensional Large-Scale Electromagnetic Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4589120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Domain Decomposition Method for Solving Three-Dimensional Large-Scale Electromagnetic Problems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4589120/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10144146","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4589120/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Domain Decomposition Method for Solving Three-Dimensional Large-Scale Electromagnetic Problems","sourcePdf":"56tap08-lu-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086839S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4589067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4589067","articleId":"4589120","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4589121,"authors":[{"name":"Jeff T.

Higher order CEM techniques use current/field basis functions of higher orders defined on large (e.g., on the order of a wavelength in each dimension) curvilinear geometrical elements, which greatly reduces the number of unknowns for a given problem. The paper reviews all major surface/volume integral- and differential-equation electromagnetic formulations within a higher order computational framework, focusing on frequency-domain solutions. With a systematic and unified review of generalized curved parametric quadrilateral, triangular, hexahedral, and tetrahedral elements and various types of higher order hierarchical and interpolatory vector basis functions, in both divergence- and curl-conforming arrangements, a large number of actual higher order techniques, representing various combinations of formulations, elements, bases, and solution procedures, are identified and discussed. The examples demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and versatility of higher order techniques, and their advantages over low-order discretizations, the most important one being a much faster (higher order) convergence of the solution. It is demonstrated that both components of the higher order modeling, namely, higher order geometrical modeling and higher order current/field modeling, are essential for accurate and efficient CEM analysis of general antenna, scattering, and microwave structures.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.926784","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4589067/04589128.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.926784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4589067","startPage":"2251","endPage":"2276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Higher Order Frequency-Domain Computational Electromagnetics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4589128","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Higher Order Frequency-Domain Computational Electromagnetics","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4589128/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10144150","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4589128/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Higher Order Frequency-Domain Computational Electromagnetics","sourcePdf":"56tap08-notaros-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.217188S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4589067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"4589067","articleId":"4589128","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4589129,"authors":[{"name":"Stanislav Ogurtsov","affiliation":["Telecommunications and Information Technology Institute, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4589069/4589129/4589129-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stanislav Ogurtsov received the Diploma degree in physics from Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russia, in 1993 and the Ph.D. degree from Arizona State University (ASU), Tempe, in 2007.","Since 2002, he had been a Graduate Research Associate with the Electronic Packaging Lab, Department of Electrical Engineering, ASU.

In this method walls are discretized into finite-size building blocks and a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach is used to compute their electromagnetic response in a periodic arrangement as well as in corner and terminal locations. These results in conjunction with an iterative field/current calculation algorithm are used to compute the interactions among the walls. The theory and the implementation of this method are described for the 2-D case. The algorithm will henceforth be referred to as ldquobrick-tracingrdquo algorithm. This field calculation leads to more accurate indoor field predictions, as it accounts for multiple scattering from periodic (cinderblocks, rebar structures, etc.) and nonperiodic wall structures and yet is computationally tractable. The FDTD computation of the walls is fast because of the finite and relatively small size of the building blocks and the iterative current computation only uses simple radiation integral calculations. Consequently computational time is much less than any full-wave simulation. At 1.0 GHz, the 2-D approach of this hybrid method is validated with a full-wave FDTD code and its capability to analyze complex indoor environments is shown.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Method for Indoor Wave Propagation Modeling","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.927548","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4589069/04589145.pdf","startPage":"2703","endPage":"2709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.927548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4589069","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4589145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4589145/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Method for Indoor Wave Propagation Modeling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4589145/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10144199","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Method for Indoor Wave Propagation Modeling","sourcePdf":"56tap08-thiel-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054925S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4589069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4589069","articleId":"4589145","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4589146,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37278828700"},{"name":"Juan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37963512600"},{"name":"Jing Xia","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Xia","id":"37287602900"},{"name":"Lixia Yang","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"firstName":"Lixia","lastName":"Yang","id":"38088793800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"4589146","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":855},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coaxial components","GSM","Multiaccess communication","Wireless LAN","Arm","Dual band","Dielectric substrates","Repeaters","Testing","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","antenna radiation patterns","bow-tie antennas","cellular radio","code division multiple access","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coaxial-fed double-sided bow-tie antenna","GSM","CDMA","3G communication","WLAN communication","dielectric substrate","radiation pattern","bandwidth 800 MHz to 960 MHz","bandwidth 1.7 GHz to 2.5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bow-tie antenna","dual-band","radiation pattern","return loss"]}],"abstract":"A coaxial-fed dual-band bow-tie antenna with two arms printed on top and bottom of dielectric substrate of epsiv\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">gamma</sub>\n = 2.2 is proposed to operate at both the CDMA/GSM band ranging from 800-960 MHz and the 3G/WLAN band ranging from 1.7-2.5 GHz.

In therapeutic mode, DMUAs generate pulsed or continuous-wave (CW) high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) beams capable of generating localized therapeutic effects within the focal volume. In imaging mode, pulse-echo data can be collected from the DMUA elements to obtain B-mode images or other forms of feedback on the state of the target tissue before, during, and after the application of the therapeutic HIFU beam. Therapeutic and technological constraints give rise to special characteristics of therapeutic arrays. Specifically, DMUAs have concave apertures with low f-number values and are typically coarsely sampled using directive elements. These characteristics necessitate pre- and post-beamforming signal processing of echo data to improve the spatial and contrast resolution and maximize the image uniformity within the imaging field of view (IxFOV). We have recently developed and experimentally validated beamforming algorithms for concave large-aperture DMUAs with directive elements. Experimental validation was performed using a 1 MHz, 64- element, concave spherical aperture with 100 mm radius of curvature. The aperture was sampled in the lateral direction using elongated elements 1 - lambda times 33.3macr - lambda with 1.333macr - lambda center-to-center spacing (lambda is the wavelength). This resulted in f-number values of 0.8 and 2 in the azimuth and elevation directions, respectively. In this paper, we present a new DMUA design approach based on different sampling of the shared concave aperture to improve image quality while maintaining therapeutic performance. A pulse-wave (PW) simulation model using a modified version of the Field II program is used in this study. The model is used in generating pulse-echo data for synthetic-aperture (SA) beamforming for forming images of a variety of targets, e.g., wire arrays and speckle-generating cyst phantoms. To provide validation for the simulation model and illustrate the improvements in image quality, we show SA images of similar targets using pulse-echo data acquired experimentally using our existing 64-element prototype. The PW simulation model is used to investigate the effect of transducer bandwidth as well as finer sampling of the concave DMUA aperture on the image quality.

The beamforming delays and apodization coefficients are described parametrically. The image is viewed as a set of independent lines that are defined in 3D by their origin, direction, and inter-sample distance. The delay calculation is recursive and inspired by the coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) algorithm. Only 3 parameters per channel and line are needed for their generation. The calculation of apodization coefficients is based on a piece- wise linear approximation. The implementation of the beamformer is optimized with respect to the architecture of a novel synthetic aperture real-time ultrasound scanner (SARUS), in which 4 channels are processed by the same set of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA). In synthetic transmit aperture imaging, low-resolution images are formed after every emission. Summing all low-resolution images produces a perfectly focused high-resolution image. The design of the beamformer is modular, and a single beamformation unit can produce 4600 low-resolution images per second, each consisting of 32 lines and 1024 complex samples per line. In its present incarnation, 3 such modules fit in a single device. The summation of low-resolution images is performed internally in the FPGA to reduce the required bandwidth. The delays are calculated with a precision of 1/16th of a sample, and the apodization coefficients with 7-bit precision. The accumulation of low-resolution images is performed with 24-bit precision. The level of the side- and grating lobes, introduced by the use of integer numbers in the calculations and truncation of intermediate results, is below -86 dB from the peak.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast parametric beamformer for synthetic aperture imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2008.860","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4589173/04589189.pdf","startPage":"1755","endPage":"1767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2008.860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4589173","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4589189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4589189/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","displayDocTitle":"Fast parametric beamformer for synthetic aperture imaging","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4589189/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10178207","pubMedId":"18986919","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast parametric beamformer for synthetic aperture imaging","sourcePdf":"t0881755.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094583S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4589173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4589173","articleId":"4589189","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4589196,"authors":[{"name":"Sanna Harma","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Physics, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/4589173/4589196/4589196-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sanna H\u00e4rm\u00e4 was born in Kotka, Finland, in 1977.

The device consists of a 2-D gold nanostructure imprinted on top of a glass substrate, followed by a 3 mum PDMS layer and a 30 nm gold layer. A laser pulse at the resonance wavelength of the gold nanostructure is focused onto the surface for ultrasound generation, while the gold nanostructure, together with the 30 nm thick gold layer and the PDMS layer in between, forms an etalon for ultrasound detection, which uses a CW laser at a wavelength far from resonance as the probing beam. The center frequency of a pulse-echo signal recorded in the far field of the transducer is 40 MHz with -6 dB bandwidth of 57 MHz. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) from a 70 mum diameter transmit element combined with a 20 mum diameter receive element probing a near perfect reflector positioned 1.5 mm from the transducer surface is more than 10 dB and has the potential to be improved by at least another 40 dB. A high-frequency ultrasound array has been emulated using multiple measurements from the transducer while mechanically scanning an imaging target. Characterization of the device's optical and acoustical properties, as well as preliminary imaging results, strongly suggest that all-optical ultrasound transducers can be used to build high-frequency arrays for real-time high-resolution ultrasound imaging.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2008.870","startPage":"1867","endPage":"1877","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2008.870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4589173","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4589173/04589199.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of a broadband all-optical ultrasound transducer-from optical and acoustical properties to imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4589199/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Characterization of a broadband all-optical ultrasound transducer-from optical and acoustical properties to imaging","volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4589199/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10178217","pubMedId":"18986929","publicationDate":"August 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of a broadband all-optical ultrasound transducer-from optical and acoustical properties to imaging","sourcePdf":"t0881867.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101717S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4589173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4589173","articleId":"4589199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":4589211,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Dong","affiliation":["IBM, Silicon Valley Laboratory, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/4731215/4589211/4589211-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Dong received the BE degree in industry automation control from the University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB), Beijing, the ME degree in information system engineering from Osaka University, Suita, Japan, and the MS and PhD degrees in computer science from Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana.

In a mobile wireless network, nodal movement can be exploited to greatly reduce the energy required by postponing communication until the sender moves close to a target receiver, subject to application deadline constraints. In this paper, we characterize the fundamental performance limit, namely the lower bound expected communication distance, achievable by any postponement algorithm within given deadline constraints. Our analytical results concern mainly the random waypoint (RWP) model. Specifically, we develop a tight analytical lower bound of the achievable expected communication distance under the model. In addition, we define a more general map-based movement model, and characterize its lower bound distance by simulations. We also address the practical attainment of distance reduction through movement-predicted communication. Specifically, whereas prior work has experimentally demonstrated the effectiveness a least distance (LD) algorithm, we provide an absolute performance measure of how closely LD can match the theoretical optimum. We show that LD achieves an average reduction in the expected communication distance within 62% to 94% of the optimal, over a realistic range of nodal speeds, for both the RWP and map-based models.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2008.113","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/4731215/04589211.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2008.113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","startPage":"276","endPage":"287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distance Reduction in Mobile Wireless Communication: Lower Bound Analysis and Practical Attainment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4589211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distance Reduction in Mobile Wireless Communication: Lower Bound Analysis and Practical Attainment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4589211/","volume":"8","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4589211/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370710","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distance Reduction in Mobile Wireless Communication: Lower Bound Analysis and Practical Attainment","sourcePdf":"ttm2009020276.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101144S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"4731215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4731215","articleId":"4589211","onlineDate":"08 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4589214,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Alon","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5156253/4589214/4589214-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jonathan Alon received the BSc degree in physics and computer science from Tel Aviv University in 1994 and the MA and PhD degrees in computer science from Boston University in 2001 and 2006, respectively.

Existing gesture recognition methods typically assume either known spatial segmentation or known temporal segmentation, or both. This paper introduces a unified framework for simultaneously performing spatial segmentation, temporal segmentation, and recognition. In the proposed framework, information flows both bottom-up and top-down. A gesture can be recognized even when the hand location is highly ambiguous and when information about when the gesture begins and ends is unavailable. Thus, the method can be applied to continuous image streams where gestures are performed in front of moving, cluttered backgrounds. The proposed method consists of three novel contributions: a spatiotemporal matching algorithm that can accommodate multiple candidate hand detections in every frame, a classifier-based pruning framework that enables accurate and early rejection of poor matches to gesture models, and a subgesture reasoning algorithm that learns which gesture models can falsely match parts of other longer gestures. The performance of the approach is evaluated on two challenging applications: recognition of hand-signed digits gestured by users wearing short-sleeved shirts, in front of a cluttered background, and retrieval of occurrences of signs of interest in a video database containing continuous, unsegmented signing in American sign language (ASL).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatiotemporal phenomena","Dynamic programming","Computer vision","Image segmentation","Streaming media","Handicapped aids","Video sequences","Information retrieval","Databases","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gesture recognition","image classification","image matching","image segmentation","image sequences","inference mechanisms","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gesture recognition","spatiotemporal gesture segmentation","video sequence","hand detection","continuous image stream","spatiotemporal matching algorithm","classifier-based pruning framework","subgesture reasoning algorithm","gesture model learning","American sign language"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gesture recognition","gesture spotting","human motion analysis","dynamic time warping","continuous dynamic programming."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Gestures","Hand","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Sign Language"]},{"kwd":["Computer vision","Human-centered computing"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5156253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.203","startPage":"1685","endPage":"1699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5156253/04589214.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Framework for Gesture Recognition and Spatiotemporal Gesture Segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Unified Framework for Gesture Recognition and Spatiotemporal Gesture Segmentation","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10773204","pubMedId":"19574627","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","volume":"31","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4589214/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4589214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Framework for Gesture Recognition and Spatiotemporal Gesture Segmentation","sourcePdf":"ttp2009091685.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120481S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5156253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"238","xplore-issue":"5156253","articleId":"4589214","onlineDate":"08 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4589216,"authors":[{"name":"Henry C.

This paper deals with a novel real-world optimization problem, called the item-location assignment problem, faced by a logistics company in Shenzhen, China. The objective of the company in this particular operation is to assign items to suitable locations such that the required sum of the total traveling time of the workers to complete all orders is minimized. A stochastic search technique called fuzzy logic guided genetic algorithms (FLGA) is proposed to solve this operational problem. In GA, a specially designed crossover operation, called a shift and uniform based multi-point (SUMP) crossover, and swap mutation are adopted. The performance of this novel crossover operation is tested and is shown to be more effective by comparing it to other crossover methods. Furthermore, the role of fuzzy logic is to dynamically adjust the crossover and mutation rates after each ten consecutive generations. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the FLGA and make comparisons with the FLGA through simulations, various search methods such as branch and bound, standard GA (i.e., without the guide of fuzzy logic), simulated annealing, tabu search, differential evolution, and two modified versions of differential evolution are adopted. Results show that the FLGA outperforms the other search methods in all of the three considered scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2008.924426","startPage":"765","endPage":"780","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/4674374/04589216.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2008.924426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Item-Location Assignment Using Fuzzy Logic Guided Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Genetic algorithms","Logistics","Search methods","Stochastic processes","Modeling","Linear programming","Large-scale systems","Genetic mutations","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","fuzzy logic","genetic algorithms","logistics","search problems","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["item-location assignment","fuzzy logic","genetic algorithm","logistics","large-scale combinatorial problem","optimization problem","stochastic search technique","shift-and-uniform based multipoint crossover","swap mutation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","item-location assignment","linear integer programming","logistics","optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4589216/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Item-Location Assignment Using Fuzzy Logic Guided Genetic Algorithms","volume":"12","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4589216/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10324523","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Item-Location Assignment Using Fuzzy Logic Guided Genetic Algorithms","sourcePdf":"12tevc06-lau.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164313S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"4674374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4674374","articleId":"4589216","onlineDate":"08 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4589931,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Motion compensation based on block matching technique generally uses the criterion of either minimum Mean Square Error (MSE)/ Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) value to find the suitable motion vector. Vector Matching Criterion (VMC) is another such method for motion compensation in the literature. In this manuscript, a new matching criterion for block based motion compensation is being proposed and compared with other existing techniques. The experimental results show that the proposed criterion of block matching gives excellent results in comparison to the existing criterion of block matching techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579619/4589950/04589962.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"137","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICALIP.2008.4589962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICALIP.2008.4589962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4589950","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4589962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A block matching criterion for interframe coding of video","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Motion compensation","Video sequences","PSNR","Encoding","Signal processing algorithms","Motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","mean square error methods","motion compensation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interframe video coding","temporal redundancy removal","video data","motion compensation","block matching","mean square error","mean absolute difference value","motion vector","vector matching criterion","video compression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4589962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A block matching criterion for interframe coding of video","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4589962/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10155516","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A block matching criterion for interframe coding of video","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041888S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579619","isNumber":"4589950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579619","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4589950","articleId":"4589962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4589974,"authors":[{"name":"Jingfeng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, North China Institute of Astronautical Engineering, Langfang, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Jingfeng Zhang","id":"37087762544"},{"name":"Ying Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, North China Institute of Astronautical Engineering, Langfang, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Ying Li","id":"37087071882"},{"name":"Yanna Wei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, North China Institute of Astronautical Engineering, Langfang, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Yanna Wei","id":"37087762466"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1723-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1724-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4589974","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":573},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4589974","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Synchronization","Real time systems","Media","Multimedia communication","Protocols","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","data communication","media streaming","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timestamp","audio-video synchronization","real-time streaming media transmission","computer network","RTP protocol","time information","RTP data packet"]}],"abstract":"Real-Time streaming media transmission is used widely in computer network, and audio-video synchronization is a key issue.

As a result, the proposed architecture can be implemented by 11750 Slices, achieves real-time processing of HD(1920times1088) frames at a rate of 30 fps in 100 MHz operation frequency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579619/4589950/04589994.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"205","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICALIP.2008.4589994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICALIP.2008.4589994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4589950","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4589994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient hardware implementation for intra prediction of AVS encoder","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Encoding","Pixel","Algorithm design and analysis","Entropy coding","Computer architecture","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy codes","high definition television","memory architecture","optimisation","scheduling","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AVS encoder","HDTV application","SATD","hardware implementation","mode decision","parallel system","scheduling","ping-pong memory architecture","intra-prediction coding","entropy coding","design optimisation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4589994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"An efficient hardware implementation for intra prediction of AVS encoder","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4589994/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10155547","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient hardware implementation for intra prediction of AVS encoder","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084346S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579619","isNumber":"4589950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579619","xplore-issue":"4589950","articleId":"4589994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"}]
