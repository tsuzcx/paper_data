Most of the advanced and optimized Smith Waterman algorithm versions have demonstrated remarkable speedup over NCBI BLAST versions, viz., SWPS3 based on x86 SSE2 instructions and CUDASW++ v2.0 CUDA implementation on GPU. This work proposes a hybrid Smith-Waterman algorithm that integrates the state-of-the art CPU and GPU solutions for accelerating Smith-Waterman algorithm in which GPU acts as a co-processor and shares the workload with the CPU enabling us to realize remarkable performance of over 70 GCUPS resulting from simultaneous CPU-GPU execution. In this work, both CPU and GPU are graded equally in performance for Smith-Waterman rather than previous approaches of porting the computationally intensive portions onto the GPUs or a naive multi-core CPU approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical

In this paper, a novel method named Hilbert Huang transform (HHT) is used to extract the features from different EEG data based on motor imagery.

By combining it with a newly derived spectral density formula for blackbody radiation, we can readily account for the emission and absorption of light and laser in terms of an undulatory, not quantum, picture. Hence, the theory of optics from emission, transmission, to absorption can be described completely by the classical wave theory without invoking the quantum hypothesis.

The approach assumes that multiple users are transmitting images from one site to another. The images are encoded over a two steps procedure: 1) pixels coding using a spatial Optical Orthogonal Signature Patterns (OOSP) and 2) bit coding using time orthogonal basis functions. Then, the encoded images are multiplexed and the results are transmitted over a multi-core fiber optics. The approach is devised to achieve a fast transmission (parallel transmission) from one site into another. The transmitted images are perturbed by noise, such as user interference, and are de-multiplexed at the receiver end. That is, the images are decoded using the same double blind Orthogonal Signatures that are used for encoding purposes. Its performance is quantitatively evaluated using Monte-Carlo simulation techniques by studying different objective criteria, such as the Root Mean Square Error, the Bit Error Rate and the Pixel Error Rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medical Image Transmission over Multi Core Optical Fiber Using Two Stages CDMA Technique","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/icbbe.2011.5780447","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5779756/5779971/05780447.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/icbbe.2011.5780447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5779971","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5780447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5780447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Medical Image Transmission over Multi Core Optical Fiber Using Two Stages CDMA Technique","conferenceDate":"10-12 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5780447/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12106513","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medical Image Transmission over Multi Core Optical Fiber Using Two Stages CDMA Technique","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-06-001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060597S","chronDate":"10-12 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5779756","isNumber":"5779971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779756","xplore-issue":"5779971","articleId":"5780447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5780507,"authors":[{"name":"Qijun Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Qijun","lastName":"Huang","id":"37676532400"},{"name":"Yajuan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yajuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"38067916900"},{"name":"Sheng Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Chang","id":"37677975200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6554-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6555-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6553-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-8480"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-8464"},{"format":"CD","value":"2156-8464"}],"articleNumber":"5780507","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Field programmable gate arrays","Finite impulse response filter","Clocks","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","discrete wavelet transforms","distributed arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","image processing","pipeline processing","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","discrete wavelet transform","image processing","DWT","inverse discrete wavelet transform","IDWT","Daubechies 8 wavelet","clock frequency","Altera Cyclone II","pipeline technology","distributed arithmetic","look-up table"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, two high-performance FPGA implementations of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and relevant inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) are proposed.

The basic principle can be extended to dual-band functionality, to cover the uplink at 30 GHz as well.

This paper provides a comparison of metrics for a 2\u00d73 dual-band MIMO system operating at 2.4 and 5 GHz in a typical office building, obtained using a commercial wireless router. The measurements are consistent with simulation results obtained using a 3D Shoot and Bounce Ray (SBR) software. Predictions of the radio propagation over an area of around 1600 m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n required an evaluation time of less than 1 hour in a single processor computer for both frequencies.

Standard empirical or deterministic field prediction methods are difficult applicable in the case of complex indoor environments, so the neural networks can be the reasonable choice. The neural network models are trained with measured values of the field strength at arbitrary points. The backpropagation training algorithm (Levenberg-Marquardt with Bayesian regularization) is compared with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm used in neural network training. After careful tuning training algorithm parameters the results showed smaller RMS errors for the PSO training case compared with backpropagation algorithm.

The two antennas are chosen to be a monopole and a PIFA. The degree of current localization is controlled by the permittivity value of the PIFA's dielectric loading. Both lossless and lossy cases are simulated in order to ascertain the underlying performance impact from current localization and its potential use in real implementation. Our results show that significant isolation enhancement is achieved with more localized currents. Moreover, the technique improves the terminal's diversity and capacity performance both at the center frequency and over a given bandwidth. In addition, PIFAs with dielectric loadings of higher permittivity values and more localized currents are physically smaller. Antenna prototypes are fabricated, and the measured results agree well with the simulated results.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05781924.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","startPage":"2423","endPage":"2426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of current localization on the performance of compact MIMO antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5781924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of current localization on the performance of compact MIMO antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5781924/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033782","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5781924/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of current localization on the performance of compact MIMO antennas","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p2423li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054978S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5781924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5781925,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel A.

Some of these selection methods require the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the communication paths between the antennas, while other require only a sampling of the signal-plus-noise component. At first look, the latter method seems to offer a considerable reduction of the overall system complexity. However, if the switching rates (i.e. the rate at which the antenna subset changes) are taken into account, the decision of which of the two methods is the most appropriate one, becomes difficult. In this paper, we examine the switching rate (SWR) of these two antenna selection approaches, providing insight into the trade-off between the switching rate and the complexity imposed by the CSI requirements.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05781926.pdf","startPage":"2432","endPage":"2435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the switching rate of ST-MIMO systems with energy-based antenna selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5781926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5781926/","displayDocTitle":"On the switching rate of ST-MIMO systems with energy-based antenna selection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033784","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5781926/","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the switching rate of ST-MIMO systems with energy-based antenna selection","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p2432lioumpas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058936S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5781926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5781947,"authors":[{"name":"A.Yu.

Thus, the elevation gives an extra value for channel models to be used in the MIMO antenna performance tests.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elevation extension for a geometry-based radio channel model and its influence on MIMO antenna correlation and gain imbalance","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782003.pdf","startPage":"2175","endPage":"2179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Elevation extension for a geometry-based radio channel model and its influence on MIMO antenna correlation and gain imbalance","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782003/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033861","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elevation extension for a geometry-based radio channel model and its influence on MIMO antenna correlation and gain imbalance","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p2175hentila.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067255S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5782004,"authors":[{"name":"Shinobu Nanba","affiliation":["KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinobu","lastName":"Nanba","id":"37284433700"},{"name":"Yuki Hirota","affiliation":["KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Hirota","id":"37951611600"},{"name":"Yoji Kishi","affiliation":["KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoji","lastName":"Kishi","id":"37284433300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0250-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5782004","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Antenna measurements","Receiving antennas","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","cellular radio","MIMO communication","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-polarized antenna","received power imbalance","propagation measurement","multiple-input multiple-output","transmission capacity","cellular mobile system","single-polarized antenna","transmitter side","optimization","cell coverage planning","MIMO capacity estimation","average SNR","signal to noise ratio","eigenvalue ratio","antenna gain","side lobe pattern","transmitter antenna"]}],"abstract":"MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) is a promising technology for increasing the transmission capacity of cellular mobile systems in proportion to the number of antennas in both transmitter and receiver. Due to their physical size, dual-polarized antennas are superior in this system to single-polarized antennas on the transmitter sides. This paper examines a 2\u00d72 MIMO with dual-polarized antennas on both transmitter and receiver. It is important to estimate MIMO capacity accurately in cellular mobile systems because optimization of cell coverage planning is advantageous in the deployment of service areas. The authors have proposed a MIMO capacity estimation method in terms of a 2\u00d72 MIMO with dual-polarized antennas, whose capacity can be estimated using only the average SNR (signal to noise ratio) because the eigenvalue ratio, which is a key factor for estimating MIMO capacity, is large and its dependency on the propagation environment is small. This paper focuses on the received power imbalance, which might for example be caused by different antenna gains due to the side lobe patterns of transmitter antennas. Measured results verify that the eigenvalue ratio is strongly dependent on the received power imbalance, decreasing in proportion to that imbalance. It is important to consider the received power imbalance to estimate the 2\u00d72 MIMO capacity accurately.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO capacity with dual-polarized antennas under received power imbalance through propagation measurements","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782004.pdf","startPage":"2180","endPage":"2183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO capacity with dual-polarized antennas under received power imbalance through propagation measurements","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782004/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033862","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO capacity with dual-polarized antennas under received power imbalance through propagation measurements","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p2180nanba.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039354S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5782005,"authors":[{"name":"E.

It enables users to enjoy the same QoS they have at home, in the office or wherever they go. 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the latest standard in the mobile cellular network technology. Innovative wireless communication systems, such as LTE, are expected to offer highly reliable broadband radio access in order to meet the increasing demands of emerging high speed data and multimedia services. For the planning of LTE networks, the investigation of radio transmission in urban areas, but also within and into buildings is getting more important. This paper introduces a deterministic approach for the simulation and performance evaluation of LTE networks in urban and indoor scenarios. Besides signal levels the expected MIMO capacity is evaluated. Comparisons with two measurement campaigns verify the high accuracy of the presented prediction model.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782006.pdf","startPage":"2187","endPage":"2191","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consideration of MIMO in the planning of LTE networks in urban and indoor scenarios","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Antenna measurements","Solid modeling","Predictive models","Buildings","MIMO","Ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","broadband networks","cellular radio","indoor communication","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","multimedia communication","radio access networks","radiocommunication","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE network planning","urban and indoor scenarios","broadband wireless access","mobile communications","QoS","3GPP long term evolution","mobile cellular network technology","innovative wireless communication systems","broadband radio access","high speed data services","multimedia services","radio transmission","performance evaluation","MIMO capacity","measurement campaigns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","MIMO channel","deterministic channel model","ray tracing","comparison with measurement data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Consideration of MIMO in the planning of LTE networks in urban and indoor scenarios","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782006/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033864","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consideration of MIMO in the planning of LTE networks in urban and indoor scenarios","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p2187stabler.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055601S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5782007,"authors":[{"name":"E.

As a result it is demonstrated that nearly perfect de-correlation of the ports of the multi antenna system can be achieved.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782054.pdf","startPage":"2492","endPage":"2496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective excitation of characteristic modes on small terminals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782054","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782054/","displayDocTitle":"Selective excitation of characteristic modes on small terminals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033912","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782054/","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective excitation of characteristic modes on small terminals","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p2492martens.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046546S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5782057,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Priebe","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4at Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Priebe","id":"37391520300"},{"name":"Martin Jacob","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4at Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Jacob","id":"37303837700"},{"name":"Thomas K\u00fcrner","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4at Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"K\u00fcrner","id":"37299707500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0250-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5782057","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":498},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Surface roughness","Rough surfaces","Ray tracing","Surface waves","Calculus","Kirchhoff's Law"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coherence","electromagnetic wave scattering","ray tracing","rough surfaces","submillimetre wave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarization investigation","rough surface scattering","THz propagation modeling","incoherent scattering processes","rough surfaces","THz frequency","polarization aspects","ray tracing algorithm","Kirchhoff theory","perturbation approach","incoherent contribution","geometrical depolarization","Jones calculus","indoor scenario","THz propagation channels"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the modeling of both coherent and incoherent scattering processes from rough surfaces at THz frequencies with the focus on polarization aspects.

The concept comprises different parts, namely antenna de-embedding from channel sounding data using high resolution DoA/DoD multipath estimations, e.g. based on the RIMAX. Subsequent channel synthesis by embedding prototype antennas into the antenna free description of the propagation channel. The arbitrary antennas under test as well as the measurement antennas are efficiently described and interpolated by the effective aperture distribution function (EADF). Limits of this novel method are found in the accuracy of the antenna free propagation model and the underlying model parameters to be estimated from the channel sounding data.

Since the channel behavior is influenced by the environment, which leads to a different behavior in different environments, the antenna design (synthesis) becomes environment dependent (time-variant) as well. In this paper, a capacity maximizing approach for the design of antenna systems in time-variant channels is presented. Real world constraints such as space, transmit power, the number and arrangement of the antennas are taken into account. A three-dimensional ray-tracing tool is used to calculate different time-variant channels in order to verify the synthesis approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782074.pdf","startPage":"2569","endPage":"2573","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna optimization for time-variant MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Antenna radiation patterns","Receiving antennas","Dipole antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","MIMO communication","mobile communication","optimisation","ray tracing","time-varying channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio channel","mobile communication","antenna systems design","time-variant channels","3d ray-tracing tool","antenna optimization","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Antenna optimization for time-variant MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782074/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033932","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna optimization for time-variant MIMO systems","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p2569reichardt.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04326S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5782088,"authors":[{"name":"D.

As shown in Studer et al., WSA 2010, such residual transmit-RF (Tx-RF) impairments have a considerable impact on the performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems, even for high-quality RF chains. In this paper, we analyze the tradeoffs arising from the dependencies of these residual Tx-RF impairments on system parameters, such as the antenna configuration and the transmit power. We find that careful selection of the transmit power (according to the given RF-chain implementation, antenna configuration, and link quality) enables to mitigate the performance loss caused by these distortions already at the transmitter.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782106.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","startPage":"2686","endPage":"2689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System-level implications of residual transmit-RF impairments in MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782106","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"System-level implications of residual transmit-RF impairments in MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782106/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033962","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5782106/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System-level implications of residual transmit-RF impairments in MIMO systems","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p2686studer.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087428S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5782108,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The project covers two measurement campaigns: the first measurement campaign was performed in August 2010 and its goal was to allow statistical analysis of the dual-polarised 2\u00d72 MIMO channel from a single satellite. A complementary measurement campaign is planned in 2011, covering the detailed evaluation of selected scenarios with respect to channel frequency selectivity and angle of arrival. This paper gives an overview of the first measurement campaign and first results gained by the analysis of the data.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782108.pdf","startPage":"2695","endPage":"2699","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical evaluation of the MIMO gain for LMS channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Satellites","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","diversity reception","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","satellite communication","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical evaluation analysis","LMS channel","mobile reception","satellite signals","antenna diversity","angle diversity","MIMOSA project target","satellite MIMO propagation channel","land mobile user","angle-of-arrival estimation","channel frequency selectivity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Statistical evaluation of the MIMO gain for LMS channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782108/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033964","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical evaluation of the MIMO gain for LMS channels","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p2695eberlein.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077622S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5782111,"authors":[{"name":"Lukasz A.

Owing to the well known non-stationary behavior of the V2V channel, we considered a Geometry-based Stochastic Channel Modeling (GSCM) approach rather than a more classical tapped-delay line one. The fading of the time-variant scatterer contributions is modeled as the combination of a distance-decaying process and two stochastic small- and large-scale fading processes. The complete parametrization of the V2V channel model is provided in the paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782118.pdf","startPage":"2881","endPage":"2885","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband measurement-based modeling of inter-vehicle channels in the 5 GHz band","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Stochastic processes","Road transportation","Antenna measurements","Channel models","Wideband","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile communication","radiowave propagation","stochastic processes","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband measurement-based modeling","intervehicle channel","V2V radio propagation channel","vehicle-to-vehicle radio propagation channel","geometry-based stochastic channel modeling approach","GSCM approach","distance-decaying process","time-variant scatterer contribution","frequency 5.3 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Wideband measurement-based modeling of inter-vehicle channels in the 5 GHz band","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782118/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033974","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband measurement-based modeling of inter-vehicle channels in the 5 GHz band","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p2881renaudin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057337S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5782119,"authors":[{"name":"Eckhard Ohlmer","affiliation":["Vodafone Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Eckhard","lastName":"Ohlmer","id":"37408490200"},{"name":"Gerhard Fettweis","affiliation":["Vodafone Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Fettweis","id":"37271859700"},{"name":"Dirk Plettemeier","affiliation":["RF and Photonics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Plettemeier","id":"37393216200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0250-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5782119","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","MIMO","Mutual information","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Delay","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system design","confined space impact","automotive communication","wireless communications","voice calls","video streaming","cellular LTE","wireless channel"]}],"abstract":"For automotive applications car to infrastructure wireless communications enable delivering infotainment services such as location based information, voice calls and video streaming. Those services require a reliable high data rate connection which could be provided by cellular LTE which supports channel adaptive MIMO transmission. However, at the automotive side, confined space is available to accommodate the antennas which gives rise to spatial correlation and mobility introduces uncertainty about the wireless channel which governs a future transmission and hence limits the adaptation accuracy. Both effects carry a high potential to decrease the data rate. This work presents field trial results for spatial correlation and assesses the impact of both effects. The results indicate that the performance loss due to mobility can significantly exceed the loss due to spatial correlation.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782119.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","startPage":"2886","endPage":"2890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO system design and field tests for terminals with confined space - impact on automotive communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO system design and field tests for terminals with confined space - impact on automotive communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782119/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033975","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5782119/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO system design and field tests for terminals with confined space - impact on automotive communication","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p2886ohlmer.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05413S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5782121,"authors":[{"name":"Moritz Schack","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4at Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Moritz","lastName":"Schack","id":"37294271600"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Nuckelt","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4at Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Nuckelt","id":"37704241300"},{"name":"Robert Geise","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Elektromagnetische Vertr\u00e4glichkeit, Technische Universit\u00e4at Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Geise","id":"37318780300"},{"name":"Lena Thiele","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Elektromagnetische Vertr\u00e4glichkeit, Technische Universit\u00e4at Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Lena","lastName":"Thiele","id":"37533867400"},{"name":"Thomas K\u00fcrner","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4at Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"K\u00fcrner","id":"37299707500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0250-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5782121","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":449},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Loss measurement","Antennas","Propagation losses","Vehicles","Solid modeling","Three dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave propagation","mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path loss measurement","urban crossroad","C2C communication","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","car-to-car communication system","nonline-of-sight","NLOS","narrow-band measurement","3D ray-optical path loss prediction","radio propagation","frequency 5.9 GHz"]}],"abstract":"The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) available at the receiver significantly affects the performance of Car-to-Car (C2C) communication systems. Thus, accurate models to predict the path loss, in particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, are essential for the development of C2C systems. Since deterministic models are very time-consuming, also fast-computable stochastic models are of great interest. This paper focuses on the radio propagation for C2C communications at urban crossroads under NLOS conditions. 3D ray-optical path loss predictions are compared with narrow-band measurements at 5.9 GHz. Furthermore, a stochastic propagation model that can be used to estimate maximum communication distances for different data rates is derived.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of path loss measurements and predictions at urban crossroads for C2C communications","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782121.pdf","startPage":"2896","endPage":"2900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of path loss measurements and predictions at urban crossroads for C2C communications","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782121/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033977","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of path loss measurements and predictions at urban crossroads for C2C communications","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p2896schack.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049143S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5782131,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Beach","affiliation":["Centre for Communications Research, University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Beach","id":"37270115800"},{"name":"Matthew Webb","affiliation":["Centre for Communications Research, University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Webb","id":"37602196500"},{"name":"Carmen Stan","affiliation":["Centre for Communications Research, University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Carmen","lastName":"Stan","id":"38072611900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0250-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5782131","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Correlation","Legged locomotion","Floors","Antennas","Antenna measurements","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","cellular radio","indoor radio","MIMO communication","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual MIMO performance","measured outdoor-to-indoor cellular scenario","wireless system","virtual multiantenna link","hardware complexity","virtual MIMO system","outdoor-to-indoor MIMO propagation measurement","K-factor"]}],"abstract":"Allowing users in a wireless system to collaborate to form a virtual multi-antenna link can reduce hardware complexity and result in improved propagation conditions, which can lead to link performance enhancements.

Focusing on antenna installation, one of the most serious problems is the limitation on installation space for additional antennas at base station (BS) sites. If we try to install more than two branches in one antenna space, the coverage area is decreased and MIMO performance is degraded because the antenna gain and the spatial correlation are affected by the limitation on installation space. This manuscript proposes MIMO Mode Selection in a Vertically Split Array (MMS-VSA) antenna, which increases the number of MIMO branches without increasing the antenna installation space and without reducing the 3G coverage area by employing mode selection in the vertically split array. The effectiveness of the MMS-VSA antenna is evaluated in a system simulation. The simulation results shows the effectiveness of the MMS-VSA antenna in increasing the number of MIMO branches without increasing the antenna installation space and without reducing the 3G coverage area. The evaluation contributes to the smooth upgrade of BS antennas from the current 3G system to the 4G MIMO system.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782148.pdf","startPage":"2751","endPage":"2755","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO base station antenna employing Mode Selection in Vertically Split Array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna arrays","Correlation","Arrays","Ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","4G mobile communication","antenna arrays","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO base station antenna installation","mode selection","vertical split array","multiple-input multiple-output technique","mobile system","BS site","spatial correlation","MMS-VSA","3G coverage area","4G MIMO system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"MIMO base station antenna employing Mode Selection in Vertically Split Array","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782148/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12034003","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO base station antenna employing Mode Selection in Vertically Split Array","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p2751inoue.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046445S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5782149,"authors":[{"name":"Vanja Plicanic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden","Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Vanja","lastName":"Plicanic","id":"37395770100"},{"name":"Buon Kiong Lau","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"lastName":"Buon Kiong Lau","id":"37285007500"},{"name":"Henrik Asplund","affiliation":["Ericsson AB, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Henrik","lastName":"Asplund","id":"37327150200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0250-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5782149","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prototypes","Antennas","MIMO","Gain","Antenna measurements","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO communication","UHF antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["experimental evaluation","MIMO terminal antenna configurations","interference-limited urban scenarios","dual-antenna configurations","multiple input multiple output channel measurements","urban macrocellular environment","eigenvalue dispersion","terminal antenna configurations","frequency 2.65 GHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we compare capacity performances of three terminal dual-antenna configurations at 2.65 GHz based on extensive 2 by 2 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel measurements in an urban macrocellular environment.

In addition to the size reduction, the proposed two-layer Rotman lens can improve the performances such as efficiency and beam pattern. Then, the two-layer design has been expanded to a Rotman lens with an 8-layer PCB substrate. The performance of the lens was verified from the simulated and measured results. The insertion loss and the radiation patterns were obtained from calculation and measurement.

Asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) and direct-current-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) transmission schemes are compared in terms of throughput and cell coverage. Cellular networks with wavelength reuse factors of 1 (full reuse), 2 and 3 are modeled, and off-the-shelf optical front-end components are assumed. Signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) maps are determined via a Monte Carlo ray-tracing (MCRT) global irradiation simulation in a computer-aided design (CAD) cabin model. Due to the use of OFDM, adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) can be applied to the SINR maps to arrive at the spatial throughput. It is shown that throughput within the range of 1.56 - 30 Mbps is achievable with the considered ACO-OFDM system, whereas DCO-OFDM doubles the throughput to 3.13-60 Mbps. In addition, wavelength reuse factors of 3 or higher are needed to ensure full cell support for both transmission schemes.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782234.pdf","startPage":"3089","endPage":"3093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the throughput of an OFDM-based cellular optical wireless system for an aircraft cabin","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782234/","displayDocTitle":"On the throughput of an OFDM-based cellular optical wireless system for an aircraft cabin","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12034089","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782234/","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the throughput of an OFDM-based cellular optical wireless system for an aircraft cabin","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p3089dimitrov.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093966S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5782237,"authors":[{"name":"Sondos Alaa El Din","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Sondos Alaa","lastName":"El Din","id":"38302624300"},{"name":"Mohamed El-Hadidy","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"El-Hadidy","id":"38305168700"},{"name":"Thomas Kaiser","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kaiser","id":"37269768700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0250-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5782237","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782237","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Interference","Ultra wideband antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Bit error rate","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","array signal processing","filtering theory","interference suppression","ray tracing","transfer functions","ultra wideband communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["realistic time reversal spatial beamforming","downlink spatial beamforming","WB-UWB interference mitigation approach","TR filter","channel state information","CSI","hybrid electromagnetic ray-tracing","ultra wideband simulation technique","deterministic simulation tool","antenna transfer function","EM simulations","wireless channel","composite heterogeneous networks","deterministic CSI"]}],"publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782237.pdf","startPage":"3104","endPage":"3108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realistic time reversal and spatial beamforming: An interference mitigation approach","abstract":"In this paper a new time domain approach which combines time reversal (TR) and downlink spatial beamforming (BF) is proposed that can result in WB/UWB Interference Mitigation (IM). In order to design the TR filter and the desired beams, the Channel State Information (CSI) between the UWB system and the other wideband (WB) victim users is required. This information is obtained using a hybrid Electromagnetic (EM) Ray-tracing Ultra Wideband (UWB) simulation technique. This deterministic simulation tool transfers complex antenna transfer function determined by EM simulations into the ray-tracing tool in order to derive a real-world description of the wireless channel. The central goal of this paper is to develop a concept of IM technique for composite heterogeneous networks where real world aspects and deterministic CSI are taken into account. The enhancement of applying IM techniques for achieving successive UWB coexistence will be illustrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782237/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12034092","publicationDate":"April 2011","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782237/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Realistic time reversal and spatial beamforming: An interference mitigation approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realistic time reversal and spatial beamforming: An interference mitigation approach","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p3104alaaeldin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060873S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5782262,"authors":[{"name":"Enrico Reiche","affiliation":["Astrium GmbH Satellites, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Reiche","id":"37328940400"},{"name":"Simon Stirland","affiliation":["Astrium Limited, Stevenage, UK"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Stirland","id":"37296569700"},{"name":"Christian Hartwanger","affiliation":["Astrium GmbH Satellites, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Hartwanger","id":"37318804300"},{"name":"Un Pyo Hong","affiliation":["Astrium GmbH Satellites, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Un Pyo","lastName":"Hong","id":"37543346500"},{"name":"Ralf Gehring","affiliation":["Astrium GmbH Satellites, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Gehring","id":"37953472700"},{"name":"Helmut Wolf","affiliation":["Astrium GmbH Satellites, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Helmut","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37302237200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0250-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5782262","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":746},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Antenna feeds","Frequency measurement","Loss measurement","Apertures","Couplers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circular waveguides","electromagnetic fields","multibeam antennas","satellite antennas","waveguide components"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF sensing","modular feed chain","satellite antennas","Ka-band","EM field co-optimization technique","waveguide components","multi-beam antenna","dual circular antennas"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dual circular combined K/Ka-band RF sensing feed chain for multi beam satellite antennas","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","endPage":"3202","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782262.pdf","startPage":"3198","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782262","abstract":"This paper presents the design process as well as the performance and test results achieved for a novel combined transmit (Tx)/receive (Rx) feed chain with RF sensing (RFS) capabilities This modular feed chain is useable for multiple spot beam satellite antennas with overlapping beams in Ka-band.

The innovation of this structure lies in the full CFRP sandwich design (including honeycomb core), the use of ultra high modulus fibres for all reflectors, tower panels, base panel, curved cleats, etc.) and in the bonded intersections (e.g. between base panel and tower structure), thus, reducing the in orbit thermo-elastic distortion to a minimum. In addition, the extremely low mass to high stiffness ratio is unique for European antenna structures. The interfaces to the spacecraft are titanium isostatic mounts compensating a possible CTE mismatch with the spacecraft top deck. The paper presents not only the design and the results of the dynamic test campaign, but also the innovative highly accurate thermo-elastic measurements performed under vacuum conditions using an ESPI measurement system and FBG optical sensors. Parent to the full CFRP antenna structure technology is the development of a new concept of Ku/Ka-Band dual gridded reflector (DGR): the front grid consists for e.g. a 1.2 m reflector of approx. 700 CFRP rods. The rear reflector can either be made of a solid full CFRP reflector shell or out of a second grid, which would lead to a revolutionary low DGR weight. The paper summarizes the results of the developments performed so far, up to the goal of first concepts for shaping the reflector grids, which would enhance significantly the application possibilities.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact and stable earth deck multi-beam Ka-Band antenna structure and dual gridded reflector","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782301.pdf","startPage":"3345","endPage":"3353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Compact and stable earth deck multi-beam Ka-Band antenna structure and dual gridded reflector","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782301/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12034155","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact and stable earth deck multi-beam Ka-Band antenna structure and dual gridded reflector","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p3345pfeiffer.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054871S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5782335,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Cheffena","affiliation":["Gjovik University College, GjOvik, Norway"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Cheffena","id":"37318025400"},{"name":"Fernando P\u00e9rez-Font\u00e1n","affiliation":["University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"P\u00e9rez-Font\u00e1n","id":"38274302000"},{"name":"Frederic Lacoste","affiliation":["French Space Agency (CNES), Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Frederic","lastName":"Lacoste","id":"37318547800"},{"name":"Erwan Corbel","affiliation":["Thales Alenia Space, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Erwan","lastName":"Corbel","id":"37283333800"},{"name":"Henri-Jose Mametsa","affiliation":["French Aerospace Laboratory ONERA, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Henri-Jose","lastName":"Mametsa","id":"37328171400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0250-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5782335","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vegetation","MIMO","Fading","Least squares approximation","Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","correlation methods","dispersion (wave)","diversity reception","electromagnetic wave polarisation","electromagnetic wave scattering","finite difference time-domain analysis","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","mobile satellite communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land mobile satellite dual polarized MIMO channel","roadside tree","performance evaluation","multiple-input multiple-output channel","multiple scattering theory","MST","signal attenuation","finite difference time-domain electromagnetic computation","FDTD electromagnetic computation","MIMO shadowing correlation matrix","single-input multiple-output technique","space diversity"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel physical-statistical, generative model for the land mobile satellite (LMS), dual polarized, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channel along tree sided roads. Said model is parameterized by means of a physical model based on the Multiple Scattering Theory (MST) which accounts for the signal attenuation and scattering by trees. Moreover, Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) electromagnetic computations were performed to characterize the scattering pattern of an isolated tree, and to calculate the MIMO shadowing correlation matrix required by the model, and not provided by MST. This modeling framework also encompasses the single-input-multiple-output (SIMO)/space diversity case. To illustrate the capabilities of the developed model, time series were generated and used in system performance calculations. The obtained results give an insight into the advantages of dual polarized MIMO and SIMO/space diversity techniques in these very frequent scenarios, and may help service providers in evaluating the technical feasibility of such systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Land mobile satellite dual polarized MIMO channel along roadside trees: Modeling and performance evaluation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782335.pdf","startPage":"3553","endPage":"3558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Land mobile satellite dual polarized MIMO channel along roadside trees: Modeling and performance evaluation","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782335/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12034188","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Land mobile satellite dual polarized MIMO channel along roadside trees: Modeling and performance evaluation","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p3553cheffena.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050251S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5782346,"authors":[{"name":"Concepcion Garcia-Pardo","affiliation":["Information Technologies and Communications Department, Technical University Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Concepcion","lastName":"Garcia-Pardo","id":"37545635500"},{"name":"Maria Martinez-Quinto","affiliation":["Information Technologies and Communications Department, Technical University Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Martinez-Quinto","id":"38316146400"},{"name":"Mayte Martinez-Ingles","affiliation":["Information Technologies and Communications Department, Technical University Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Mayte","lastName":"Martinez-Ingles","id":"38338992000"},{"name":"Jose Maria Molina-Garcia-Pardo","affiliation":["Information Technologies and Communications Department, Technical University Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose Maria","lastName":"Molina-Garcia-Pardo","id":"37267388300"},{"name":"Jose Victor Rodr\u00edguez","affiliation":["Information Technologies and Communications Department, Technical University Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose Victor","lastName":"Rodr\u00edguez","id":"38274308500"},{"name":"Leandro Juan-Llacer","affiliation":["Information Technologies and Communications Department, Technical University Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Leandro","lastName":"Juan-Llacer","id":"38260182200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0250-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5782346","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Signal to noise ratio","Bandwidth","MIMO","Antenna measurements","Receivers","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laboratories","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","polarimetry","radiowave propagation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-UWB channel","polarimetric analysis","indoor multiple-input multiple-output ultra-wideband measurement","radio-wave polarization","laboratories environment","mean path loss","RMS delay spread","bandwidth 2 GHz to 5 GHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a 4 \u00d7 4 indoor multiple-input multiple-output ultra-wideband (MIMO-UWB) measurement campaign in the 2-5 GHz bandwidth is presented.

However, the re-configurability of such antenna is limited, since parasitic elements were constrained to use only passive loads. If we are to integrate such systems to cost-sensitive devices (as for example in wireless sensor nodes for structural or urban microclimate monitoring), we should be able to fully emulate traditional smart antenna systems, using a single RF feed. This paper presents a method for generating parasitic loads with a negative real part using active circuit blocks. The proposed method could be used for increasing the modulation order of the aforementioned systems, decrease the required number of parasitic elements or even optimize the antenna efficiency in energy-constraint applications. Two alternative designs are presented: a consumer-off-the-shelf JFET based resistance circuit block, which could generate a load real part of up to -15 Ohm with power consumption of 40mW, and a CMOS based negative resistance circuit, which could generate negative resistances of up to -30 Ohm with power consumption around 1mW.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782362.pdf","startPage":"3663","endPage":"3667","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active parasitic arrays for low cost compact MIMO transmitters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistance","Modulation","CMOS integrated circuits","Antenna arrays","Transistors","Power demand","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","array signal processing","CMOS integrated circuits","junction gate field effect transistors","MIMO communication","negative resistance circuits","radio transmitters","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active parasitic arrays","low cost compact MIMO transmitters","electronically steerable passive array radiator antennas","beam-forming","spatial multiplexing","smart antenna systems","wireless sensor nodes","structural microclimate monitoring","urban microclimate monitoring","single RF feed","active circuit blocks","modulation order","energy-constraint applications","consumer-off-the-shelf JFET","resistance circuit block","CMOS based negative resistance circuit","power 40 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["active parasitic array","positive feedback","negative resistance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782362/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Active parasitic arrays for low cost compact MIMO transmitters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782362/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12034215","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active parasitic arrays for low cost compact MIMO transmitters","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p3663han.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055667S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5782386,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this way we validate the WINNER model, but also empirically verify how much variation within the same scenario can be expected when measurements are performed in different cities.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-scale parameters of wideband MIMO channel in urban multi-cell scenario","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782386.pdf","startPage":"3759","endPage":"3763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782386/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Large-scale parameters of wideband MIMO channel in urban multi-cell scenario","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782386/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12034239","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-scale parameters of wideband MIMO channel in urban multi-cell scenario","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p3759narandzic.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088081S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5782389,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Sweden"],"lastName":"Xiang Gao","id":"38064624000"},{"name":"Andres Alayon Glazunov","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Network Design (CWiND), University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK","School of Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Andres","lastName":"Alayon Glazunov","id":"37266421800"},{"name":"Jialai Weng","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Network Design (CWiND), University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"lastName":"Jialai Weng","id":"38059447000"},{"name":"Cheng Fang","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Network Design (CWiND), University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"lastName":"Cheng Fang","id":"38059855500"},{"name":"Jie Zhang","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Network Design (CWiND), University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"lastName":"Jie Zhang","id":"37281474400"},{"name":"Fredrik Tufvesson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Tufvesson","id":"37296876300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0250-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5782389","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":384},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Interference","Delay","Correlation","Area measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","MIMO communication","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["residential femto-cell systems","residential channel measurement","channel properties","delay spread","interference levels","residential houses","spatial separation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["femto-cell","residential area","channel measurements"]}],"abstract":"Interference between femto-cell systems is a critical factor for the deployment of such systems in, e.g., residential areas.

Portability between hardware manufactured by different vendors and also between highly specialized and parallel computing architectures available on the market, i.e. GPUs, multi-core CPUs and devices integrating both technologies in a single-die IC, is the main advantage of this solver. For code execution on GPUs, the computational domain is decomposed along the slowest direction, and electromagnetic field boundary data is shared between neighboring subdomains. The communication overhead between GPUs is proportional to the area of the boundary and represents the rate-limiting step of the method. Utilized hardware devices allow the communication overhead to be hidden by computations for sufficiently large simulation domains, giving a scaling efficiency higher than 90%. CPUs placed in different sockets on a motherboard are visible by the OpenCL driver as a single computing device with an aggregated number of cores, thus decomposition of the domain is not necessary for solver execution on multi-core CPUs. The paper subsequently shows results of numerical tests aimed at evaluation of the developed code in realistic simulations of problems in computational electromagnetics.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of the multi-device OpenCL FDTD solver","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782450.pdf","startPage":"3995","endPage":"3998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of the multi-device OpenCL FDTD solver","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782450/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12034302","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of the multi-device OpenCL FDTD solver","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p3995stefanski.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062092S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5782458,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The antenna is based on a capacitive loaded metallic circular ring that exhibits multimode characteristic at 2.4 GHz. The multimode behaviour is obtained using four feeding ports excited with specific phase configurations. The proposed antenna can be easily integrated into clothing due to its thickness and flexibility. Furthermore, its multimode behaviour helps to reduce the attenuation originated by NLOS (Non Line of Sight) environments and multipath propagation. The performance of the multimode antenna is similar to a MIMO system, but using a single antenna, so the space necessary in human body is minimized. For this reason, the multimode antenna constitutes a compact solution for WBAN applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Textile MIMO antenna for Wireless Body Area Networks","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782458.pdf","startPage":"428","endPage":"432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782458/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Textile MIMO antenna for Wireless Body Area Networks","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782458/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12034310","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Textile MIMO antenna for Wireless Body Area Networks","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p428santiso.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067124S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5782471,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Belfiori","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology, Delft, NL"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Belfiori","id":"37548046000"},{"name":"Noud Maas","affiliation":["TNO - Defence, Security and Safety, The Hague, NL"],"firstName":"Noud","lastName":"Maas","id":"37591259800"},{"name":"Peter Hoogeboom","affiliation":["TNO - Defence, Security and Safety, The Hague, NL","Delft University of Technology, Delft, NL"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Hoogeboom","id":"37300167700"},{"name":"Wim van Rossum","affiliation":["TNO - Defence, Security and Safety, The Hague, NL"],"firstName":"Wim","lastName":"van Rossum","id":"37266739800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0250-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-88-8202-074-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"5782471","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":666},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitters","Radar","Radar antennas","Phased arrays","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CW radar","FM radar","MIMO radar","search radar","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TDMA X-band FMCW MIMO radar","short range surveillance","compact radar device","private area surveillance application","pan tilt zoom camera","multiple-input multiple-output processing","frequency modulated continuous waveform transmission"]}],"abstract":"The work presented in this paper was aimed at the design of a compact radar device to be used for private area surveillance applications.

Rapid advances in nanomaterial fabrication techniques will allow in the near future, heterogeneous samples to be created with nano or micro-sized inclusions, and this paper investigates the electromagnetic (EM) properties of these structures. Analytical equations by various authors for the effective permittivity and permeability of such artificial materials have been analysed and compared over microwave frequencies. The particle size, spacing and frequency were examined individually to understand their role in determining the effective EM parameters of the heterogeneous mixture. Furthermore, results from FDTD simulations with micro-sized cuboids were processed using an inverse scattering algorithm to obtain the effective permittivity and permeability of these heterogenous structures using a complimentary technique. The canonical formulations showed reasonable agreement with the EM simulations and the two methods can be used to design novel dielectric substrates.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782472.pdf","startPage":"488","endPage":"492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on the variation in dielectric properties of heterogeneous substrates composed of nanomaterials","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782472/","displayDocTitle":"Study on the variation in dielectric properties of heterogeneous substrates composed of nanomaterials","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12034324","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782472/","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on the variation in dielectric properties of heterogeneous substrates composed of nanomaterials","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p488njoku.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061093S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5782473,"authors":[{"name":"Kwok L.

The necessity for removing the coaxial cables, is here demonstrated with an example MIMO parameter - correlation. It is found by simulations, that the presence of cables not only completely changes this parameter, but the concrete cable position can also be very significant. The device proposed here, uses two parallel RF-over-fiber channels with low power consumption in wideband operation. The achieved dynamic range is up to 60 dB with acceptable isolation for two particular design frequencies and up to one hour of operation on a single battery charge. The total electrical dimensions are 40\u00d740\u00d710 mm, making it suitable for typical phone mock-ups. It can be used in both anechoic, as well as stirred mode chambers.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782499.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","startPage":"58","endPage":"61","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO OTA optical measurement device","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO OTA optical measurement device","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782499/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12034351","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5782499/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO OTA optical measurement device","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p58yanakiev.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047089S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5782536,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The modelling of these types of links presents considerable challenges. In this paper, a 60 GHz link consisting of two Cavity Backed Slot antennas, the terminals on which they are mounted and the intervening environment, is modelled using an enhanced FDTD technique. This type of problem can be expensive in computer resources because of the existence of small geometrical detail and also a large computational space. To improve on this, the problem is split into three parts which are linked using a Time Domain Huygens (TDH) approach. An improvement of around 56 % is obtained in the overall run time compared to a direct FDTD run. The approach has much potential and is suitable to be applied in larger and more complex communications links.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782577.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"89","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD channel modelling with time domain huygens' technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Computational modeling","Slot antennas","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre wave antennas","slot antennas","time-domain analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD channel modelling","time domain Huygens technique","communication links","cavity backed slot antennas","frequency 60 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"FDTD channel modelling with time domain huygens' technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782577/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12034427","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD channel modelling with time domain huygens' technique","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p86dumanli.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075436S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5782578,"authors":[{"name":"Umair Rafique","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Mohammad Ali Jinnah University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Umair","lastName":"Rafique","id":"37892356800"},{"name":"Ghaffer I.

Preliminary simulation results are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771476/5780481/05782578.pdf","startPage":"872","endPage":"875","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5780481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency selective surface absorber for WLAN security","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency selective surfaces","Reflection","Resonant frequency","Wireless LAN","Simulation","Microwave theory and techniques","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave polarisation","frequency selective surfaces","telecommunication security","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency selective surface absorber","WLAN security","wireless local area network","FSS","TE polarization","TM polarization","frequency 5 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782578/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Frequency selective surface absorber for WLAN security","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782578/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12034428","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency selective surface absorber for WLAN security","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"p872rafique.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041809S","chronDate":"11-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771476","isNumber":"5780481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771476","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5780481","articleId":"5782578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5782616,"authors":[{"name":"Edgardo J.

Common implementations are often based in single-address access memories, which simplifies the algorithm logic but does not provide a cost-effective solution. This paper presents a DDR3 memory based FPGA implementation of the ISDB-T time interleaving stage. Widely available on the market for a broad type of applications, this kind of memory allows high data throughput and represents a low cost alternative. However, data must comply with a special structure and signalling since the memory access is burst-oriented. Consequently, the complexity is increased. The proposed design is both area-efficient and highly reconfigurable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033385","htmlLink":"/document/5782616/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A DDR3 memory based time interleaving FPGA implementation for ISDB-T standard","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DDR3 memory based time interleaving FPGA implementation for ISDB-T standard","confLoc":"Cordoba, Argentina","sourcePdf":"p01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099859S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771182","isNumber":"5782103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771182","xplore-issue":"5782103","articleId":"5782616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5782617,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The external memory access is the system bottleneck when decoding high definition video sequences in real time.

to Precise Instrumentation, every application is increasing the analog to digital interface data rate. The ultra-high sampling rate of the ADCs demands the use of advanced acquisition techniques as well as the latest technology available. The utilization of dedicated Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) is an expensive solution to deal with the very high throughput from the ADC and its lack of flexibility is a huge drawback. On the other hand, the technology, the architecture and the state-of-the art of the current Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) make them especially suitable to act as interface between an ultra-high speed ADC and a data processing unit. Another extra advantage is the reconfigurability of the FPGAs, they can be quickly adapted to different ADCs or different data processing units. The purpose of this paper is to present a practical approach to interface an ultra-high speed 8-bit ADC, MAX104, from Maxim Integrated Circuit, which performs digitalization of the input signal with a sampling rate of 1Gsps and a commercial and popular FPGA, the Virtex2 Pro, from Xilinx Corporation. Once the ADC digital data have been acquired, then they can be processed by either the dedicated FPGA Digital Signal Processing (DSP) blocks, or the FPGA embedded processors or just send the data out to a PC for later processing. Hence, the proposed method of implementation can be used as front-end of a wide range of applications.","doi":"10.1109/SPL.2011.5782642","publicationTitle":"2011 VII Southern Conference on Programmable Logic (SPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 VII Southern Conference on Programmable Logic (SPL)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771182/5782103/05782642.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPL.2011.5782642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5782103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of an ultra-high speed ADC interface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782642/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of an ultra-high speed ADC interface","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033410","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782642/","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of an ultra-high speed ADC interface","confLoc":"Cordoba, Argentina","sourcePdf":"p27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04559S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771182","isNumber":"5782103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771182","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5782103","articleId":"5782642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5782643,"authors":[{"name":"Walter Bast","affiliation":["Cavitation and Biotechnology Laboratory, Balseiro Institute, Bariloche Atomic Center, CNEA-CONICET, Rio Negro, Argentina"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Bast","id":"37949683000"},{"name":"Dami\u00e1n Dellavale","affiliation":["Cavitation and Biotechnology Laboratory, Balseiro Institute, Bariloche Atomic Center, CNEA-CONICET, Rio Negro, Argentina"],"firstName":"Dami\u00e1n","lastName":"Dellavale","id":"37643475500"},{"name":"Fabi\u00e1n Bonetto","affiliation":["Cavitation and Biotechnology Laboratory, Balseiro Institute, Bariloche Atomic Center, CNEA-CONICET, Rio Negro, Argentina"],"firstName":"Fabi\u00e1n","lastName":"Bonetto","id":"37318111700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8848-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8847-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8846-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5782643","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Neurons","Signal processing algorithms","Mathematical model","Voltage measurement","Computer architecture","Biomembranes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","bioelectric phenomena","clamps","field programmable gate arrays","finite state machines","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","dynamic-clamp system","dynamic-clamp electrophysiological technique","ion channels","field programmable gate array","state machine","logic arbiter","ADC","DAC","signal processing module","HH-type ion channel conductances","dynamic-clamp control loop"]}],"abstract":"The dynamic-clamp electrophysiological technique allows the mimicking of the electrical effects of ion channels embedded into the membrane of an intracellularly recorded cell. Dynamic-clamp relies on the establishing of a loop between the injected current and the recorded membrane potential. In this work, a real-time dynamic-clamp system was implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The system proposed allows the concurrent controlling of the activation of several ion channels. The architecture of the instrument developed is based on two main modules: a state machine (as the logic arbiter) with the ADC and DAC interface, and a signal processing module. The state machine controls the converters along with the serial data-transfer interface (SPI). The signal processing module implements the algorithms needed to mimic several HH-type ion channel conductances. Extensive simulations of the device operation were made, showing that the instrument developed implements effectively the dynamic-clamp control loop, with a maximum operation frequency of 532 kHZ. The main application of this instrument is the manipulation of ion channels.","doi":"10.1109/SPL.2011.5782643","publicationTitle":"2011 VII Southern Conference on Programmable Logic (SPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 VII Southern Conference on Programmable Logic (SPL)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771182/5782103/05782643.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPL.2011.5782643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5782103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of a \u201cdynamic-clamp\u201d system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782643/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of a \u201cdynamic-clamp\u201d system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033411","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782643/","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of a \u201cdynamic-clamp\u201d system","confLoc":"Cordoba, Argentina","sourcePdf":"p28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067926S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771182","isNumber":"5782103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771182","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5782103","articleId":"5782643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5782644,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel M.

Consequently it is convenient to have hardware implementations for both, analog and digital versions. Discrete components, Micro Controllers, Digital Signal Processors (DSP) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are possible choices. For digital realizations the Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE's) are replaced by a discrete time system. Furthermore numerical values are expressed in a numerical representation. It is well known that these two discretization processes may strongly affect the chaotic behavior of the system. In previous contributions we considered the use of the Euler's algorithm in two different numerical representations: (a) integer arithmetics and (b) single floating point IEEE-754 standard. For applications that require a good agreement between the analog chaotic system and its digital counterpart, more involved algorithms and/or numerical representations must be used. Guided by numerical simulations, in this paper we propose an improvement replacing the Euler's algorithm by the fourth order Runge Kutta algorithm (RKA). In order to diminish the required hardware a method based on blocks' reusing is proposed. The procedure is exemplified on a Lorenz CS.

This makes ECC a good choice for implementing security services in constrained devices, like the mobile ones. However, the diversity of ECC implementation parameters recommended by international standards has led to interoperability problems among ECC implementations. This work presents the design and implementation results of a novel FPGA coprocessor for ECC than can be reconfigured at run time to support different implementation parameters and hence, different security levels. Regardless there are several related works in the literature, to our knowledge this is the first ECC coprocessor that makes use of a partial reconfigurable methodology to deal with interoperability problems in ECC. A suitable application of the proposed reconfigurable coprocessor is the security protocol IPSec, where the domain parameters for ECC-based cryptographic schemes, like digital signature or encryption, have to be negotiated and agreed upon by the communication partners at run time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reconfigurable GF(2<sup>M</sup>) elliptic curve cryptographic coprocessor","publicationTitle":"2011 VII Southern Conference on Programmable Logic (SPL)","doi":"10.1109/SPL.2011.5782650","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 VII Southern Conference on Programmable Logic (SPL)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771182/5782103/05782650.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPL.2011.5782650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5782103","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"A reconfigurable GF(2<sup>M</sup>) elliptic curve cryptographic coprocessor","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782650/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033418","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reconfigurable GF(2<sup>M</sup>) elliptic curve cryptographic coprocessor","confLoc":"Cordoba, Argentina","sourcePdf":"p35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076553S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771182","isNumber":"5782103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771182","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5782103","articleId":"5782650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5782651,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Ehliar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Ehliar","id":"37282015400"},{"name":"Jacob Siverskog","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Siverskog","id":"38076854200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8848-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8847-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8846-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5782651","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Radiation detectors","Debugging","Table lookup","Hardware","Monitoring","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer debugging","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","public domain software","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Xilinx FPGA designs","partial reconfigurability","debugging framework","open source debugging tool","memory blocks"]}],"abstract":"This paper discusses the use of partial reconfigurability in Xilinx FPGA designs in order to aid debugging.

SPICE simulations were then used to investigate the temperature dependence of parameters like the feedback time and restoring current of the cell. The shape and magnitude of the particle-induced transient current was discussed as a function of temperature. The variability in the temperature response was attributed to the balance of contrasting factors, such as cell slowing down and increased diffusion collection with increasing temperature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"12033351","htmlLink":"/document/5782693/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Factors impacting the temperature dependence of soft errors in commercial SRAMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Factors impacting the temperature dependence of soft errors in commercial SRAMs","confLoc":"Jyvaskyla, Finland","sourcePdf":"RADECS2008031sessionBB3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082566S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5771181","isNumber":"5782661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771181","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5782661","articleId":"5782693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5782703,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A universal mean amplitude is extracted from these distributions and the number of RTS defects appears to scale well with total NIEL.

One potential way to mitigate against nonlinear phase noise is to use phase-sensitive amplifiers (PSAs) that have been demonstrated to help remove such phase noise as well as to provide simultaneous signal amplitude noise suppression when operated in saturation. Recently, we have shown that a PSA-based signal regenerator based on degenerate four-wave mixing could be implemented in a network-compatible manner in which only the (noisy) signal is present at the device input (black-box operation). However, this scheme was tested only with relatively high-frequency deterministic perturbations applied to the signal. Here, we address both theoretically and experimentally the important issue of how such a regenerator works with more realistic random broadband amplitude/phase noise distributions. Good regenerative performance is demonstrated and our study also illustrates an additional unique feature of PSA-based regenerators-namely error correction for differentially encoded signals when placed in front of a DPSK receiver. Furthermore, we present a simplified regenerator implementation providing highly stable operation and representing a significant further step toward a practical device.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","accessionNumber":"12577105","htmlLink":"/document/5782926/","displayDocTitle":"Coherent All-Optical Phase and Amplitude Regenerator of Binary Phase-Encoded Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent All-Optical Phase and Amplitude Regenerator of Binary Phase-Encoded Signals","sourcePdf":"jstqe-slavik-2136329-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101542S","chronDate":"March-April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"6158729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6158729","articleId":"5782926","onlineDate":"31 May 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5782932,"authors":[{"name":"Guangcai Sun","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Guangcai","lastName":"Sun","id":"37596858300"},{"name":"Mengdao Xing","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Microwave Imaging, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China","National Key Laboratory for Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Mengdao","lastName":"Xing","id":"37300837500"},{"name":"Yong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Geography, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085699743"},{"name":"Yufeng Wu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Yufeng","lastName":"Wu","id":"38067731000"},{"name":"Yirong Wu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Microwave Imaging, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yirong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37293505200"},{"name":"Zheng Bao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Bao","id":"37274384700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"5782932","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":876},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sliding Spotlight and TOPS SAR Data Processing Without Subaperture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782932","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Azimuth","Signal processing algorithms","Synthetic aperture radar","Focusing","Bandwidth","Chirp"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sliding spotlight","TOPS SAR data processing","data acquisition","terrain observation","progressive scan","synthetic aperture radar","azimuth bandwidth","azimuth signal aliasing","Doppler domain","subaperture method","pulse repetition frequency","instantaneous bandwidth","imaging algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sliding spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","subaperture","terrain observation by progressive scan (TOPS) SAR"]}],"abstract":"During the data acquisition of a sliding spotlight or terrain observation by progressive scan (TOPS) synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the steering of the antenna main beam increases the azimuth bandwidth but could result in the azimuth signal aliasing in the Doppler domain.

In doing so, we eliminated the obvious increase in data volume or the subaperture division by choosing the pulse repetition frequency that is only 20% greater than the instantaneous bandwidth. The method was incorporated with an available imaging algorithm and then used to process simulated and collected data of the sliding spotlight and TOPS SARs.

The motion vectors (MVs) for various partitions are formalized as motion samples taken on an irregular grid. From this viewpoint, determining OBMC weights to associate with these samples becomes an under-determined problem since a distinct solution has to be sought for each prediction pixel. In this paper, we tackle this problem by expressing the optimal weights in closed form based on parametric signal assumptions. In particular, the computation of this solution requires only the geometric relations between the prediction pixel and its nearby block centers, leading to a generic framework capable of reconstructing temporal predictors from any irregularly sampled MVs. A modified implementation is also proposed to address the MV location uncertainty and to reduce computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme performs better than similar previous works, and when compared to the recently proposed Quadtree-based adaptive loop filter and enhanced adaptive interpolation filter, show a comparable gain. Furthermore, the combination of it with either of them gives a combined effect that is almost the sum of their separate improvements.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2158341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2158341","startPage":"113","endPage":"127","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6121964/05782943.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6121964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametric OBMC for Pixel-Adaptive Temporal Prediction on Irregular Motion Sampling Grids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Parametric OBMC for Pixel-Adaptive Temporal Prediction on Irregular Motion Sampling Grids","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2012","volume":"22","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782943/","accessionNumber":"12443869","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782943/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric OBMC for Pixel-Adaptive Temporal Prediction on Irregular Motion Sampling Grids","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-chen-2158341-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090051S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6121964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6121964","articleId":"5782943","onlineDate":"31 May 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5782945,"authors":[{"name":"Idaku Ishii","affiliation":["Department of System Cybernetics, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6121964/5782945/5782945-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Idaku Ishii (M'06) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in mathematical engineering and information physics from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 1992, 1994, and 2000, respectively.","Currently, he is a Professor with Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.

Metal gate granularity (MGG) and corresponding workfunction-induced threshold-voltage variability have become important sources of statistical variability in bulk HKMG MOSFETs. It is found that the number of metal grains covering the gate plays an important role in determining the shape of the threshold-voltage distribution and the magnitude of the threshold-voltage variability in scaled devices in the presence of dominant variability sources (MGG, random discrete dopants, and line edge roughness). The placement of metal grains is found to also contribute to the total MGG variability. This paper presents the relative importance of MGG compared with other statistical variability sources. It is found that MGG can distort and even dominate the threshold-voltage statistical distribution when the metal grain size cannot be adequately controlled.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2011.2149531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5959271/05782949.pdf","startPage":"2293","endPage":"2301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2011.2149531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5959271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Threshold-Voltage Variability in Scaled Decananometer Bulk HKMG MOSFETs: A Full-Scale 3-D Simulation Scaling Study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 May 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782949/","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Threshold-Voltage Variability in Scaled Decananometer Bulk HKMG MOSFETs: A Full-Scale 3-D Simulation Scaling Study","volume":"58","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12120767","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5782949/","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Threshold-Voltage Variability in Scaled Decananometer Bulk HKMG MOSFETs: A Full-Scale 3-D Simulation Scaling Study","sourcePdf":"ted-wang-2149531-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119665S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5959271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"5959271","articleId":"5782949","onlineDate":"31 May 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5782953,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Jafarzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Nevada-Reno, Reno, NV, USA"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Jafarzadeh","id":"38556469500"},{"name":"M.

The idea is to find a maximum-volume simplex whose vertices are drawn from the pixel vectors. Winter's belief has stimulated much interest, resulting in many different variations of pixel search algorithms, widely known as N-FINDR, being proposed. In this paper, we take a continuous optimization perspective to revisit Winter's belief, where the aim is to provide an alternative framework of formulating and understanding Winter's belief in a systematic manner. We first prove that, fundamentally, the existence of pure pixels is not only sufficient for the Winter problem to perfectly identify the ground-truth endmembers but also necessary. Then, under the umbrella of the Winter problem, we derive two methods using two different optimization strategies. One is by alternating optimization. The resulting algorithm turns out to be an N-FINDR variant, but, with the proposed formulation, we can pin down some of its convergence characteristics. Another is by successive optimization; interestingly, the resulting algorithm is found to exhibit some similarity to vertex component analysis. Hence, the framework provides linkage and alternative interpretations to these existing algorithms. Furthermore, we propose a robust worst case generalization of the Winter problem for accounting for perturbed pixel effects in the noisy scenario. An algorithm combining alternating optimization and projected subgradients is devised to deal with the problem. We use both simulations and real data experiments to demonstrate the viability and merits of the proposed algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simplex Volume Maximization Framework for Hyperspectral Endmember Extraction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2141672","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6059695/05782956.pdf","startPage":"4177","endPage":"4193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2141672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6059695","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 May 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Simplex Volume Maximization Framework for Hyperspectral Endmember Extraction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5782956/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317811","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simplex Volume Maximization Framework for Hyperspectral Endmember Extraction","sourcePdf":"tgrs-ma-2141672-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160533S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6059695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"6059695","articleId":"5782956","onlineDate":"31 May 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5782957,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Sedaghat","affiliation":["Geomatics Department, Khajeh Nasir Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6059698/5782957/5782957-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amin Sedaghat was born in Shirvan, Iran, in 1985.

The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) approach, as a well-known feature-based image matching algorithm, has been successfully applied in a number of automatic registration of remote sensing images. Regardless of its distinctiveness and robustness, the SIFT algorithm suffers from some problems in the quality, quantity, and distribution of extracted features particularly in multisource remote sensing imageries. In this paper, an improved SIFT algorithm is introduced that is fully automated and applicable to various kinds of optical remote sensing images, even with those that are five times the difference in scale. The main key of the proposed approach is a selection strategy of SIFT features in the full distribution of location and scale where the feature qualities are quarantined based on the stability and distinctiveness constraints. Then, the extracted features are introduced to an initial cross-matching process followed by a consistency check in the projective transformation model. Comprehensive evaluation of efficiency, distribution quality, and positional accuracy of the extracted point pairs proves the capabilities of the proposed matching algorithm on a variety of optical remote sensing images.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2144607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6059698","startPage":"4516","endPage":"4527","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6059698/05782957.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uniform Robust Scale-Invariant Feature Matching for Optical Remote Sensing Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782957/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5782957/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Uniform Robust Scale-Invariant Feature Matching for Optical Remote Sensing Images","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12326677","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"49","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uniform Robust Scale-Invariant Feature Matching for Optical Remote Sensing Images","sourcePdf":"tgrs-mokhtarzade-2144607-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095043S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6059698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"184","xplore-issue":"6059698","articleId":"5782957","onlineDate":"31 May 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5782961,"authors":[{"name":"Matteo Perenzoni","affiliation":["Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), Povo, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5928962/5782961/5782961-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Matteo Perenzoni (M'09) was born in Rovereto, Trento, Italy, in August 1977.

In this paper we assess the technology trend based on three industrial technologies (90, 65, and 45 nm) using a state of the art processor as benchmark: The UltraSparc Niagara 2 from SUN Microsystem. We analyze frequency, dynamic, and static power and area after synthesis varying power supply voltage and temperature. We then compare these exhaustive analyses of system level performance as a function of technology to ITRS device level estimations. The results suggest that this prediction can be of help when addressing both the technological scaling and the variability scenario of the selected technology. We believe that correctly predicting specific values on performance variations when realistic conditions and technologies are changed could provide a valuable information for the architect. Our analysis advises the designer on the effective applicability of the ITRS trends to system performance, but also pinpoints that a reliable system level prediction should better take into account the design complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UDSM Trends Comparison: From Technology Roadmap to UltraSparc Niagara2","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2148183","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6210451/05782972.pdf","startPage":"1341","endPage":"1346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2148183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6210451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782972/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 May 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","displayDocTitle":"UDSM Trends Comparison: From Technology Roadmap to UltraSparc Niagara2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5782972/","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12769223","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UDSM Trends Comparison: From Technology Roadmap to UltraSparc Niagara2","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-graziano-2148183-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091203S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6210451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6210451","articleId":"5782972","onlineDate":"31 May 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5782975,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6196243/5782975/5782975-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Zhao received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering and the M.S. degree in computer science from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, in 2011.","He is currently a senior ASIC DFT Engineer with Advanced Micro Devices.

The source maintains a queue for each message flow if it is not served immediately. The channel from the source to the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>\n users is modeled as a fading broadcast channel, and the channel state information is assumed to be known to the source and the corresponding receivers. Two eavesdropping models are considered. For a collaborative eavesdropping model, in which the eavesdroppers exchange their outputs, the secrecy capacity region is obtained, within which each rate vector is achieved by using a time-division scheme and a source power control policy over channel states. A throughput optimal queue-length-based rate scheduling algorithm is further derived that stabilizes all arrival rate vectors contained in the secrecy capacity region. Moreover, the network utility function is maximized via joint design of rate control, rate scheduling, power control, and secure coding. More precisely, a source controls the message arrival rate according to its message queue, the rate scheduling selects a transmission rate based the queue length vector, and the rate vector is achieved by power control and secure coding. These components work jointly to solve the network utility maximization problem. For a noncollaborative eavesdropping model, in which eavesdroppers do not exchange their outputs, an achievable secrecy rate region is derived based on a time-division scheme, and the queue-length-based rate scheduling algorithm and the corresponding power control policy are obtained that stabilize all arrival rate vectors in this region. The network utility maximizing rate control vector is also obtained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Communications Over Wireless Broadcast Networks: Stability and Utility Maximization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2011.2158311","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5983315/05782980.pdf","startPage":"682","endPage":"692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2158311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782980/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 May 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Secure Communications Over Wireless Broadcast Networks: Stability and Utility Maximization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5782980/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205660","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Communications Over Wireless Broadcast Networks: Stability and Utility Maximization","sourcePdf":"tifs-liang-2158311-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158754S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5983315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5983315","articleId":"5782980","onlineDate":"31 May 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5782985,"authors":[{"name":"Gene Cheung","affiliation":["National Institute of Informatics (NII), Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6045652/5782985/5782985-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gene Cheung (M'00\u2013SM'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in 1995, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1998 and 2000, respectively.","From 2000 to 2009, he was a Senior Researcher with Hewlett-Packard Laboratories Japan, Tokyo, Japan.

In this paper, we address the problem of efficient bit allocation among texture and depth maps of multiview images. More specifically, suppose we are given a coding tool to encode texture and depth maps at the encoder and a view-synthesis tool to construct intermediate views at the decoder using neighboring encoded texture and depth maps. Our goal is to determine how to best select captured views for encoding and distribute available bits among texture and depth maps of selected coded views, such that the visual distortion of desired constructed views is minimized. First, in order to obtain at the encoder a low complexity estimate of the visual quality of a large number of desired synthesized views, we derive a cubic distortion model based on basic DIBR properties, whose parameters are obtained using only a small number of viewpoint samples. Then, we demonstrate that the optimal selection of coded views and quantization levels for corresponding texture and depth maps is equivalent to the shortest path in a specially constructed 3-D trellis. Finally, we show that, using the assumptions of monotonicity in the predictor's quantization level and distance, suboptimal solutions can be efficiently pruned from the feasible space during solution search. Experiments show that our proposed efficient selection of coded views and quantization levels for corresponding texture and depth maps outperforms an alternative scheme using constant quantization levels for all maps (commonly used in video standard implementations) by up to 1.5 dB. Moreover, the complexity of our scheme can be reduced by at least 80% over the full solution search.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Dependent Bit Allocation for Multiview Image Coding With Depth-Image-Based Rendering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2158230","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6045652/05782985.pdf","startPage":"3179","endPage":"3194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2158230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5782985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5782985/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 May 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"On Dependent Bit Allocation for Multiview Image Coding With Depth-Image-Based Rendering","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5782985/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12300800","pubMedId":"21632301","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Dependent Bit Allocation for Multiview Image Coding With Depth-Image-Based Rendering","sourcePdf":"tip-cheung-2158230-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140639S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6045652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6045652","articleId":"5782985","onlineDate":"31 May 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5782987,"authors":[{"name":"Yongbing Zhang","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yongbing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086632521"},{"name":"Debin Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Debin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37277017000"},{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085460014"},{"name":"Ruiqin Xiong","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Video Technology, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruiqin","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37287683300"},{"name":"Wen Gao","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Video Technology, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Gao","id":"37275735100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"5782987","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2594},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Pixel","Transform coding","PSNR","Image coding","Image resolution","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sampling","interpolation","least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation-dependent image downsampling","least squares algorithm","content-dependent IDID","varying interpolation coefficient","sum of square errors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Downsampling","interpolation","least squares","upsampling"]}],"abstract":"Traditional methods for image downsampling commit to remove the aliasing artifacts.

Given an interpolation method, the goal of IDID is to obtain a downsampled image that minimizes the sum of square errors between the input image and the one interpolated from the corresponding downsampled image. Utilizing a least squares algorithm, the solution of IDID is derived as the inverse operator of upsampling.

The network parameters are updated using a complex-valued extended Kalman filter algorithm. CSRAN starts with no hidden neuron and builds up an appropriate number of hidden neurons, resulting in a compact structure. Performance of the CSRAN is evaluated using a synthetic complex-valued function approximation problem, two real-world applications consisting of a complex quadrature amplitude modulation channel equalization, and an adaptive beam-forming problem. Since complex-valued neural networks are good decision makers, the decision-making ability of the CSRAN is compared with other complex-valued classifiers and the best performing real-valued classifier using two benchmark unbalanced classification problems from UCI machine learning repository.

The Neurochip-2 also has three separate stimulation channels. Two \u201cprogrammable-system-on-chips\u201d (PSoCs) control the data acquisition and stimulus output. The PSoCs permit flexible real-time processing of the recorded data, such as digital filtering and time-amplitude window discrimination. The PSoCs can be programmed to deliver stimulation contingent on neural events or deliver preprogrammed stimuli. Access pins to the microcontroller are also available to connect external devices, such as accelerometers.

We first consider a typical training scenario, where the transmitter transmits training symbols followed by data symbols, and the receiver performs channel estimation using the training symbols and then uses the imperfect channel estimates to decode the data symbols. From the DMT perspective, our results show that as long as the training power is equal to the data power, the obtained DMT result based on imperfect channel state information at receiver (CSIR) is the same as the original DMT result with perfect CSIR given in Zheng and Tse's seminal work . We extend the analysis to two-way training scenarios, with single and multiple training rounds. Our results show that two-way training together with power control can substantially improve the achievable diversity gain. Specifically, the achievable DMT with multiple training rounds can be described as a single straight line; while in the case of single training round, the achievable DMT is much lower and can be described as a single straight line or a collection of line segments, depending on the underlying training strategy and channel qualities.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.052311.100038","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5955046/05783003.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.052311.100038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5955046","startPage":"2080","endPage":"2089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Control and Channel Training for MIMO Channels: A DMT Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Control and Channel Training for MIMO Channels: A DMT Perspective","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783003/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 May 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12157870","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5783003/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Control and Channel Training for MIMO Channels: A DMT Perspective","sourcePdf":"2080-tw1107-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100373S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5955046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5955046","articleId":"5783003","onlineDate":"31 May 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5783004,"authors":[{"name":"Giwan Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5955046/5783004/5783004-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giwan Choi (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejon, Korea, in 2006 and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2008.

Numerous strategies have been proposed in the literature to enable cooperative diversity. Among them, decode-and-forward protocol has been well adopted because of its low implementation complexity. However, most decode-and-forward based schemes assume that the relay node has perfect error detection or has feedback information from the destination. In this paper, we design power profiles at the relay which enable diversity at the destination without any feedback or coding assumptions at the relay and source. Furthermore, the diversity orders enabled by any general power profile are quantified. We then summarize necessary and sufficient conditions on the power profiles to guarantee full diversity at the destination. The theoretical analysis is corroborated with numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.052311.100515","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5955046/05783004.pdf","startPage":"2124","endPage":"2134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.052311.100515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5955046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing Diversity-Enabled Power Profiles for Decode-and-Forward Wireless Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 May 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783004/","displayDocTitle":"Designing Diversity-Enabled Power Profiles for Decode-and-Forward Wireless Relay Networks","volume":"10","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12157871","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783004/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing Diversity-Enabled Power Profiles for Decode-and-Forward Wireless Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"2124-tw1107-choi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071666S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5955046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5955046","articleId":"5783004","onlineDate":"31 May 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5783008,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongyuan Zhao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongyuan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38066337300"},{"name":"Zhiguo Ding","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic, and Computer Engineering, University of Newcastle, UK"],"firstName":"Zhiguo","lastName":"Ding","id":"37278653500"},{"name":"Mugen Peng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mugen","lastName":"Peng","id":"37269684700"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459100"},{"name":"Kin K.

For amplify-and-forward relay systems, we propose new linear processing strategies for maximizing the sum rate performance by applying a blockwise relaying method combined with convex optimization techniques. To reduce a computational complexity, we first consider a zero-forcing based relay only optimization scheme, which generate a closed-form solution in a non-iterative fashion. In order to further improve the sum rate at low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, we additionally design an enhanced relay filter by exploiting the blockwise relaying method based on a minimum mean-square error criterion. Simulation results show that the proposed relay design strategies outperform the existing conventional schemes in terms of the sum rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blockwise Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Strategies for Multipoint-to-Multipoint MIMO Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.052311.101493","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5955046/05783010.pdf","startPage":"2028","endPage":"2033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.052311.101493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5955046","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783010/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 May 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Blockwise Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Strategies for Multipoint-to-Multipoint MIMO Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5783010/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12110379","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blockwise Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Strategies for Multipoint-to-Multipoint MIMO Networks","sourcePdf":"2028-tw1107-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056902S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5955046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5955046","articleId":"5783010","onlineDate":"31 May 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5783020,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The adoption of a 3D NoC design depends on the performance and manufacturing cost of the chip. Therefore, a study of the placement of the TSV, that connects different layers of a 3D chip, is crucial. A 64-core 3D NoC is modeled based on state-of-the-art 2D chips. We discuss the number of TSVs required for a 3D NoC. Different placements of layer-layer connections are explored. We present benchmark results using a cycle accurate full system simulator based on realistic workloads. Experiments show that under different workloads, the average network latencies in two configurations (full and quarter connection) are reduced by 14.78% and 7.38% respectively, compared with the one-eighth connection design. The improvement of performance is a trade-off of manufacturing cost.

In this paper, an investigation of a TRNG design based on several oscillator rings implemented in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) is performed in order to determine the amount of true randomness or entropy in this design. A model of the TRNG based on the number of hits in the transition regions generating entropy is proposed. This model takes into account the fact that the jitter of an oscillator ring is not constant, but increases or accumulates if the ring is not sampled in a region close to a transition point where the oscillator ring output changes from logic 0 to logic 1 or vice versa. The model of the TRNG is implemented in MatLab and simulations are performed showing the influence of different design parameters and also the influence of properties of the FPGA device on quality of randomness.","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2011.5783072","publicationTitle":"14th IEEE International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"14th IEEE International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771301/5783023/05783072.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2011.5783072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Behavioral model of TRNG based on oscillator rings implemented in FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Behavioral model of TRNG based on oscillator rings implemented in FPGA","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783072/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033465","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Behavioral model of TRNG based on oscillator rings implemented in FPGA","confLoc":"Cottbus, Germany","sourcePdf":"163Poster110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067327S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771301","isNumber":"5783023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771301","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5783023","articleId":"5783072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5783077,"authors":[{"name":"Hagen S\u00e4mrow","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"Hagen","lastName":"S\u00e4mrow","id":"37992585800"},{"name":"Claas Cornelius","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"Claas","lastName":"Cornelius","id":"37299060600"},{"name":"Philipp Gorski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Gorski","id":"37547344100"},{"name":"Jakob Salzmann","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Salzmann","id":"37298887800"},{"name":"Andreas Tockhorn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Tockhorn","id":"37597401800"},{"name":"Dirk Timmermann","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Timmermann","id":"37271844800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9756-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9755-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9754-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5783077","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tunneling magnetoresistance","Power demand","Circuit faults","Reliability engineering","Delta modulation","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit reliability","logic design","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TMR","power efficient ASIC design","error resilient ASIC design","VLSI design method","triple modular redundancy","reliability problem","low power redundant design solution","error detection","operation control","ALU","permanent physical defect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circuit Design","Reliability","Triple Modular Redundancy","Power Consumption","Power-Aware Design"]}],"abstract":"Progressive technology scaling raises the need for efficient VLSI design methods facing the increasing vulnerability to permanent physical defects, while considering power efficiency of resulting circuit implementations at the same time. Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) represents a common method to encounter reliability problems, but has the drawback of increased area and power consumption. This work introduces a Low Power Redundant (LPR) design solution that targets the power penalty of TMR implementations. This is done by enhanced and new functional runtime capabilities for error detection and operation control. By exploiting the inherent modularity and parallelism of TMR, the LPR solution applies additional control logic to switch dynamically between compare phases (to indicate faults and their locations) and parallel operation (with reduced operation frequency). This allows power optimized circuit operation with full support for the treatment of permanent faults. Simulation results on different ALU implementations show a decrease of power consumption of up to 60% compared to conventional TMR. Furthermore, different strategies for the switching between operation modes are introduced that enable power efficient system operation in the presence of permanent physical defects. Moreover, significant reliability improvements are also achieved due to the adaptive use of the redundant modules.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Functional enhancements of TMR for power efficient and error resilient ASIC designs","publicationTitle":"14th IEEE International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2011.5783077","displayPublicationTitle":"14th IEEE International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771301/5783023/05783077.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2011.5783077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Functional enhancements of TMR for power efficient and error resilient ASIC designs","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783077/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033469","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Functional enhancements of TMR for power efficient and error resilient ASIC designs","confLoc":"Cottbus, Germany","sourcePdf":"183Ses4A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077498S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771301","isNumber":"5783023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771301","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5783023","articleId":"5783077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5783088,"authors":[{"name":"Carmen Garc\u00eda","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, BarcelonaTECH, UPC, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Carmen","lastName":"Garc\u00eda","id":"38059368400"},{"name":"Antonio Rubio","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, BarcelonaTECH, UPC, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Rubio","id":"37331955500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9756-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9755-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9754-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5783088","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CNTFETs","Random access memory","CMOS integrated circuits","Electron tubes","CMOS technology","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotubes","CMOS memory circuits","elemental semiconductors","field effect transistors","silicon","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manufacturing variability analysis","6T SRAM scenario","silicon bulk CMOS technology","carbon nanotube field effect transistors","metallic carbon nanotubes","MOSFET","CNFET static random access memory","C","Si"]}],"abstract":"In silicon bulk CMOS technology the variability of the device parameters is a key drawback that may be a limiting factor for further miniaturizing nodes.

The emphasis is done on applications that involve fast processing of new incoming data items, such as resorting. Parallelism is achieved by constructing N binary trees (N>;1) and applying concurrent operations to N trees at the same time with the aid of N communicating processing modules. It is shown that the considered technique can efficiently be combined with sorting networks, which gives new potentialities for optimization. Modeling in software, experiments with FPGA-based circuits on different computing platforms, and comparisons with the other known methods demonstrate that the performance is increased significantly. It is also shown that the proposed algorithms are easily scalable.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Computational modeling","Field programmable gate arrays","Graphics processing unit","Hardware","Adaptation model","US Department of Defense"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrency control","field programmable gate arrays","parallel algorithms","sorting","tree data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance hardware accelerator","priority sorting","priority management","algorithm optimization","tree-like data structure","database","embedded system","binary tree","concurrent operation","sorting network","FPGA-based circuit","parallel algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["tree-like data structures","fast resorting","managing priorities","hierarchical FSMs","parallelization","sorting networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783103","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2011.5783103","startPage":"313","endPage":"318","publicationTitle":"14th IEEE International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"14th IEEE International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771301/5783023/05783103.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2011.5783103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783103/","displayDocTitle":"High-performance hardware accelerators for sorting and managing priorities","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12033493","htmlLink":"/document/5783103/","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance hardware accelerators for sorting and managing priorities","confLoc":"Cottbus, Germany","sourcePdf":"313Ses6A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057688S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771301","isNumber":"5783023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771301","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5783023","articleId":"5783103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5783110,"authors":[{"name":"L.

SRAM testing is mainly based on the concept of fault model used to mimic faulty behaviors. Traditionally, the effects of bit line coupling capacitances have not been considered during the fault analysis. However, recent works show the increasing impact of bit line coupling capacitances on the SRAM behavior. This paper reviews and discusses preview works addressing the issues coming from bit line parasitic capacitances and data contents on SRAM testing, pointing out the impacts of these effects on the existing test solutions. Then, we introduce two optimizations of the state-of-the-art test solution able to take into account the influence of bit line coupling capacitances while reducing the test length of about 60% and 80%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2011.5783110","publicationTitle":"14th IEEE International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"14th IEEE International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5771301/5783023/05783110.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2011.5783110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized march test flow for detecting memory faults in SRAM devices under bit line coupling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783110/","displayDocTitle":"Optimized march test flow for detecting memory faults in SRAM devices under bit line coupling","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783110/","publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2011","accessionNumber":"12033499","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized march test flow for detecting memory faults in SRAM devices under bit line coupling","confLoc":"Cottbus, Germany","sourcePdf":"353Ses7A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078518S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5771301","isNumber":"5783023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771301","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5783023","articleId":"5783110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5783112,"authors":[{"name":"Elena I.

This paper statistically analyzes the behavior of the 6T SRAM cell in data retention mode, under process variability. The failure probabilities under various supply voltages are determined for different technology nodes, and the Data Retention Voltage is determined.

SRAM is one of the key components in a SoC and it occupies a large portion of the SoC. Thus, the SRAM bitcell is typically designed using very small transistors for high integration, which limits the minimum operating voltage (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">CCmin</sub>\n) of the SoC because of the large threshold voltage (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>\n) mismatch between paired transistors caused by small feature size. As process technology scales down to sub-32nm technology, the 6T SRAM bitcell that is currently used may not achieve proper stability, write-ability, and read-ability at the required operating voltage. In this paper, several approaches are investigated to resolve the issue, such as upsized 6T SRAM bitcell, 8T SRAM bitcell, read- and write-preferred bitcells, and read- and write-assist circuits. HSPICE simulations are performed using PTM 32nm model parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12034597","htmlLink":"/document/5783219/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","conferenceDate":"2-4 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SRAM bitcell design for low voltage operation in deep submicron technologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAM bitcell design for low voltage operation in deep submicron technologies","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"I2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059026S","chronDate":"2-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5773347","isNumber":"5783182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5773347","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5783182","articleId":"5783219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5783220,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Hsien Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Design Technology Division, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Hsien","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37534328000"},{"name":"Shawn S.

The ESD protection network is composed of dual-diode and a gate-driven power clamp achieving an ESD level of 2.8 kV human body model (HBM). Owing to the co-design approach, the NF only degrades by 0.2 dB compared with the reference LNA without the ESD network. The ESD-LNA presents a power gain of 13.0 dB with the input and output return losses both greater than 10 dB.

Using NNs to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, an NN state observer is designed to estimate the immeasurable states. By combining the adaptive backstepping technique with decentralized control design principle, an adaptive NN decentralized output feedback control approach is developed. In order to overcome the problem of \u201cexplosion of complexity\u201d inherent in the proposed control approach, the dynamic surface control (DSC) technique is introduced into the first adaptive NN decentralized control scheme, and a simplified adaptive NN decentralized output feedback DSC approach is developed. It is proved that the two proposed control approaches can guarantee that all the signals of the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the observer errors and the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Decentralized Backstepping Output-Feedback Control for Nonlinear Large-Scale Systems With Time Delays","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2011.2146274","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5937482/05783302.pdf","startPage":"1073","endPage":"1086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2011.2146274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937482","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783302/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Decentralized Backstepping Output-Feedback Control for Nonlinear Large-Scale Systems With Time Delays","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12094056","pubMedId":"21642041","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Neural Network Decentralized Backstepping Output-Feedback Control for Nonlinear Large-Scale Systems With Time Delays","sourcePdf":"tnn-tong-2146274-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067227S","chronDate":"July  2011","isNumber":"5937482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"251","articleId":"5783302","onlineDate":"02 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":5783309,"authors":[{"name":"Pietro Andreani","affiliation":["Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5928962/5783309/5783309-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pietro Andreani (SM'07) received the M.S.E.E. degree from the University of Pisa, Italy, in 1988, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Information Technology (EIT), Lund University, Sweden, in 1999.","Between 2001 and 2007, he was Chair Professor at the Center for Physical Electronics, Technical University of Denmark.

The traditional narrowband linear receiving and channelizing technologies should not be applied to deal with the complicated multiple-signal excitation with unknown or time-varying characteristics of time domain or frequency domain. Here, the harmonic and the intermodulation components brought about by the wideband digital receiver are firstly identified and extracted in the frequency domain, then a blind identification criterion for minimizing the short-time energy of the nonlinear components is designed, and the steepest descent method (SDM) or the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm is applied to extract and update iteratively the parameters of the nonlinear behavior model of the wideband digital receiver. Finally, the updated model is utilized to compensate the nonlinear distortion of the receiver in real time. The experimental results show that the spur-free dynamic range (SFDR) of the blind identification digital receiver achieves about 20-dB higher than that of the traditional receiver under multitone or 16-QAM bandpass signal excitation. As regards the large bandwidth and the high power efficiency of the RF front end and ADC circuits, the blind identification receiver architecture is helpful for detecting weak signal in concomitance with in-band or out-of-band strong jammers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6059687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2151050","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6059687/05783316.pdf","startPage":"2776","endPage":"2789","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2151050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of Software-Defined Radio Receiver Based on Blind Nonlinear System Identification and Compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of Software-Defined Radio Receiver Based on Blind Nonlinear System Identification and Compensation","volume":"58","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5783316/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12328155","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783316/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of Software-Defined Radio Receiver Based on Blind Nonlinear System Identification and Compensation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-peng-2151050-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121055S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6059687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6059687","articleId":"5783316","onlineDate":"02 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5783317,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Han Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6059687/5783317/5783317-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tsung-Han Yu (S'10) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

The hardware realization of wideband sensing is challenging because strong primary users introduce large dynamic range and spectral leakage in adjacent unused bands. This paper proposes a multitap-windowed frequency power detector with adaptive threshold and sensing time to address the above challenges. The suppression of spectral leakage is achieved by multitap-windowed FFT processing, which also enables reduced sensing time. The sensing time and detection threshold are adapted according to the channel-specific spectral leakage, which results in a reliable wideband signal detection within constrained sensing time. Our simulations with a 20 dB interferer-to-noise ratio (INR) indicate a 2\u00d7 improvement in detection rate compared to conventional power detectors. An order-of-magnitude improvement in sensing time is achieved in the presence of 30-dB INR interferers while maintaining a false-alarm rate of 0.1 and a detection rate of 0.9. The proposed algorithms are realized in an FPGA to demonstrate real-time operation with a latency below 10 \u03bc s. Experimental results from a radio testbed closely match the numerical simulations.

Excellent results for the gamma photon interaction position determination in these detectors have been obtained by means of the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n -nearest neighbor (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n -NN) method.

These improved methods utilize the information contained in the calibration data more effectively. The alternative approaches were tested on a dataset measured with a SiPM-array-based monolithic LYSO detector. It appears that, depending on the number of reference events, ~ 10% to ~ 25% better spatial resolution can be obtained compared to the standard approach. Moreover, the methods amongst these that are equivalent to calibrating with a line source may allow for much faster and easier collection of the reference data. Finally, some of the improved methods yield essentially the same spatial resolution as the standard method using ~ 200 times less reference data, greatly reducing the time needed for both calibration and interaction position computation. Thus, using the improvements proposed in this work, the high spatial resolution obtainable with the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n-NN method may come within practical reach and, furthermore, the calibration may no longer be a limiting factor for the application of monolithic scintillator detectors in PET scanners.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783323/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783323/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12288023","volume":"58","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improved Nearest Neighbor Methods for Gamma Photon Interaction Position Determination in Monolithic Scintillator PET Detectors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Nearest Neighbor Methods for Gamma Photon Interaction Position Determination in Monolithic Scintillator PET Detectors","sourcePdf":"tns-vandam-2150762-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073578S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"6041077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6041077","articleId":"5783323","onlineDate":"02 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5783330,"authors":[{"name":"Kiran George","affiliation":["California State University Fullerton, Fullerton, CA, US"],"firstName":"Kiran","lastName":"George"},{"name":"Chien-In Henry Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Chien-In Henry","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280751800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9456"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9662"}],"articleNumber":"5783330","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":715},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ims.org/main/index.php"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783330","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Graphics processing unit","Frequency measurement","Field programmable gate arrays","Fast Fourier transforms","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","field programmable gate arrays","radar receivers","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid computing platform digital wideband receiver design","performance measurement","radar receiver","high instantaneous dynamic range","multiple-signal-detection capability","high-frequency resolution","gigasample-per-second digital wideband receiver system","Nvidia Tesla C2050 graphics processor units","Xilinx Virtex-5 field-programmable gate array","receiver architecture","high-resolution spectral estimation","bandwidth 1.25 GHz","frequency 125 MHz to 1375 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital wideband receivers","fast Fourier transform (FFT)","field-programmable gate array (FPGA)","graphics processor unit (GPU)","hybrid computing platform","instantaneous dynamic range (IDR)","multiple-signal detection"]}],"abstract":"As a modern radar receiver must rapidly search a large frequency range with maximum sensitivity, capabilities such as high instantaneous dynamic range (IDR), good multiple-signal-detection capability, wider bandwidth (BW), and high-frequency resolution are indispensable.

In this paper, an innovative three gigasample-per-second hybrid computing platform digital wideband receiver system is presented, which employs two Nvidia Tesla C2050 graphics processor units and a Xilinx Virtex-5 field-programmable gate array for hardware acceleration to drastically improve receiver performance over its predecessor designs. The receiver detects five simultaneous signals in 1.25-GHz BW (125-1375 MHz) with a maximum IDR of 42.5 dB and a frequency resolution of 0.5 MHz.

A branch of existing hyperspectral unmixing algorithms is based on Craig's criterion, which states that the vertices of the minimum-volume simplex enclosing the hyperspectral data should yield high fidelity estimates of the endmember signatures associated with the data cloud. Recently, we have developed a minimum-volume enclosing simplex (MVES) algorithm based on Craig's criterion and validated that the MVES algorithm is very useful to unmix highly mixed hyperspectral data. However, the presence of noise in the observations expands the actual data cloud, and as a consequence, the endmember estimates obtained by applying Craig-criterion-based algorithms to the noisy data may no longer be in close proximity to the true endmember signatures. In this paper, we propose a robust MVES (RMVES) algorithm that accounts for the noise effects in the observations by employing chance constraints. These chance constraints in turn control the volume of the resulting simplex. Under the Gaussian noise assumption, the chance-constrained MVES problem can be formulated into a deterministic nonlinear program. The problem can then be conveniently handled by alternating optimization, in which each subproblem involved is handled by using sequential quadratic programming solvers. The proposed RMVES is compared with several existing benchmark algorithms, including its predecessor, the MVES algorithm. Monte Carlo simulations and real hyperspectral data experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed RMVES algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2151197","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6059695/05783340.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2151197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6059695","startPage":"4194","endPage":"4209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chance-Constrained Robust Minimum-Volume Enclosing Simplex Algorithm for Hyperspectral Unmixing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Chance-Constrained Robust Minimum-Volume Enclosing Simplex Algorithm for Hyperspectral Unmixing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783340/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317812","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chance-Constrained Robust Minimum-Volume Enclosing Simplex Algorithm for Hyperspectral Unmixing","sourcePdf":"tgrs-chan-2151197-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043553S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","isNumber":"6059695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"57","articleId":"5783340","onlineDate":"02 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5783341,"authors":[{"name":"Yingbo Zhou","affiliation":["State University of New York, Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA","Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6069499/5783341/5783341-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yingbo Zhou received the B.E. degree in computer science from the Civil Aviation University of China, in 2006, and the M.S. degree in computer science (with distinction) from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, in 2010.

In the proposed method, the reference torque is directly translated into the reference current waveform using the analytical expression. Optimization criteria of a TSF that are concerned with secondary objectives, such as minimization of copper losses or maximization of drive performance, are described. In addition, a novel family of TSFs is introduced. An optimal TSF can be easily extracted from the proposed family to satisfy one of the secondary objectives or to create balance between more of them. Control performances of the two extracted TSFs and the two optimized conventional (linear and sinusoidal) TSFs are compared. These four TSFs keep the copper losses to nearly the theoretical minimum. Each of them provides approximately the same operation efficiency of the considered three-phase 6/4 SRM drive. However, due to extension of the commutation angle between adjacent phases, TSFs from the proposed family provide better torque-speed characteristics. Moreover, one of them expands the possible speed range of torque-ripple-free drive operation, and another one, which provides the best torque-speed characteristics, reduces the peak phase current.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783348/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","volume":"27","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12409237","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5783348/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Minimization of Torque Ripple and Copper Losses in Switched Reluctance Drive","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimization of Torque Ripple and Copper Losses in Switched Reluctance Drive","sourcePdf":"tpel-vujicic-2158447-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061816S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6099646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"175","xplore-issue":"6099646","articleId":"5783348","onlineDate":"02 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":5783351,"authors":[{"name":"Ting Kong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5978836/5783351/5783351-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ting Kong received B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2003 and 2006 and the Ph.D. degree from the University of California, Riverside, in 2011.","Her research interests include statistical and array signal processing and signal processing in wireless multihop networks."]},"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Kong","id":"37700617100"},{"name":"Yingbo Hua","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5978836/5783351/5783351-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Yingbo Hua (S'86\u2013M'88\u2013SM'92\u2013F'02) received the B.S. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1982 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, in 1983 and 1988.","From 1990 to 2001, he was a Professor at the University of Melbourne, Australia.

This scheme has two phases. In the first phase, the source does not transmit while the relay transmits and the destination receives. In the second phase, the source transmits, the relay amplifies and forwards, and the destination receives. At the destination, the data received in the first phase are used to estimate the relay-to-destination channel, and the data received in the second phase are used to estimate the source-to-relay channel. The linear minimum mean-square error estimation (LMMSE) is used for channel estimation, which allows the use of prior knowledge of channel correlations. For phase 1, an algorithm is developed to compute the optimal source pilot matrix for use at the relay. For phase 2, an algorithm is developed to compute the optimal source pilot matrix for use at the source and the optimal relay pilot matrix for use at the relay.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2158429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5978836/05783351.pdf","startPage":"4438","endPage":"4446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2158429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Design of Source and Relay Pilots for MIMO Relay Channel Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783351/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Design of Source and Relay Pilots for MIMO Relay Channel Estimation","volume":"59","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205554","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783351/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Design of Source and Relay Pilots for MIMO Relay Channel Estimation","sourcePdf":"tsp-kong-2158429-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081555S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5978836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5978836","articleId":"5783351","onlineDate":"02 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5783352,"authors":[{"name":"Idan Ram","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5978836/5783352/5783352-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Idan Ram received the B.

The proposed method generalizes the Haar-like transform recently introduced by Gavish , and can also construct data adaptive orthonormal wavelets beyond Haar. It is defined via a hierarchical tree, which is assumed to capture the geometry and structure of the input data, and is applied to the data using a modified version of the common one-dimensional (1D) wavelet filtering and decimation scheme. The adaptivity of this wavelet scheme is obtained by permutations derived from the tree and applied to the approximation coefficients in each decomposition level, before they are filtered. We show that the proposed transform is more efficient than both the 1D and two-dimension 2D separable wavelet transforms in representing images. We also explore the application of the proposed transform to image denoising, and show that combined with a subimage averaging scheme, it achieves denoising results which are similar to those obtained with the K-SVD algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Tree-Based Wavelet Transform","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2158428","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5978836/05783352.pdf","startPage":"4199","endPage":"4209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2158428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978836","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Tree-Based Wavelet Transform","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5783352/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205555","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Tree-Based Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"tsp-ram-2158428-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09781S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5978836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5978836","articleId":"5783352","onlineDate":"02 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5783353,"authors":[{"name":"Ba-Tuong Vo","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Ba-Tuong","lastName":"Vo","id":"37289281300"},{"name":"Daniel Clark","affiliation":["Joint Research Institute in Signal and Image Processing, School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Clark","id":"37289464500"},{"name":"Ba-Ngu Vo","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Ba-Ngu","lastName":"Vo","id":"37274760500"},{"name":"Branko Ristic","affiliation":["ISR Division, Defence Science and Technology Organisation, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Branko","lastName":"Ristic","id":"37274497700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5783353","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1111},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smoothing methods","Joints","Target tracking","Monte Carlo methods","Clutter","Estimation","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","Monte Carlo methods","object detection","random processes","signal detection","smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bernoulli forward-backward smoothing","joint target detection","target tracking","sequential Monte Carlo","Bernoulli random finite set","finite set statistics","filtering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Detection","estimation","filtering","smoothing","tracking"]}],"abstract":"In this correspondence, we derive a forward-backward smoother for joint target detection and estimation and propose a sequential Monte Carlo implementation.

In this letter, we propose a solution to the PSBS problem based on a periodic sampling procedure and a simple least squares (LS) reconstruction method. For this PSBS technique, we derive the lowest possible average sampling rate, which is much lower than the Nyquist rate of the signal. Note the difference with spectrum blind sampling (SBS) where the goal is to perfectly reconstruct the spectrum and not the power spectrum of the signal, in which case sub-Nyquist rate sampling is only possible if the spectrum is sparse. In the current work, we can perform sub-Nyquist rate sampling without making any constraints on the power spectrum, because we try to reconstruct the power spectrum and not the spectrum. In many applications, such as spectrum sensing for cognitive radio, the power spectrum is of interest and estimating the spectrum is basically overkill.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12067885","htmlLink":"/document/5783505/","displayDocTitle":"Power Spectrum Blind Sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Spectrum Blind Sampling","sourcePdf":"lsp-leus-2158604-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04928S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5873694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5873694","articleId":"5783505","onlineDate":"02 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5783512,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangyuan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New Jersey, Rutgers, New Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Jiangyuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37405653400"},{"name":"Athina P.

This paper presents a new approach based on a screening process for improved voltage/SOC balancing of a Li-ion series battery pack. Two kinds of screening processes, capacity screening and resistance screening, are implemented in an orderly manner. The capacity screening process matches open-circuit voltage (OCV)-SOC relation for achievement of voltage/SOC balancing. In the resistance screening process, pulse-type discharging/charging currents are applied to various SOC points to select the cells with similar voltage variance. Through two screening processes, the cells that have similar electrochemical characteristics are finally selected, and can be used for stable configuration of a Li-ion series battery pack. The proposed screening process has been validated by extensive experimental results and SOC estimation results based on extended Kalman filter.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2158553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6099646/05783518.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2158553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6099646","startPage":"411","endPage":"424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable Configuration of a Li-Ion Series Battery Pack Based on a Screening Process for Improved Voltage/SOC Balancing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stable Configuration of a Li-Ion Series Battery Pack Based on a Screening Process for Improved Voltage/SOC Balancing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783518/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12409238","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5783518/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable Configuration of a Li-Ion Series Battery Pack Based on a Screening Process for Improved Voltage/SOC Balancing","sourcePdf":"tpel-kim-2158553-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079774S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6099646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"6099646","articleId":"5783518","onlineDate":"02 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5783519,"authors":[{"name":"Jonghoon Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6099646/5783519/5783519-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jonghoon Kim (S'06) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea, in 2005, and is currently working toward the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees at Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.","His main research interests include battery management system (BMS; modeling, screening, equalization, and SOC/SOH estimation) and fuel cell system (ripple current analysis, SOH prediction, and modeling).

This paper presents a complementary cooperation algorithm based on DEKF combined with pattern recognition as an application Hamming neural network to the identification of suitable battery model parameters for improved SOC/capacity estimation and SOH prediction. Two kinds of pattern such as discharging/charging voltage pattern (DCVP) and capacity pattern (CP) were measured, together with the battery parameters, as representative patterns. Through statistical analysis, the Hamming network is applied for identification of the representative DCVP and CP that most closely matche that of the arbitrary battery to be measured. The model parameters of the representative battery are then applied for SOC/capacity estimation and SOH prediction of the arbitrary battery using the DEKF. This avoids the need for repeated parameter measurement.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2158554","startPage":"436","endPage":"451","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6099646/05783519.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2158554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6099646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complementary Cooperation Algorithm Based on DEKF Combined With Pattern Recognition for SOC/Capacity Estimation and SOH Prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","System-on-a-chip","Estimation","Battery charge measurement","Mathematical model","Prediction algorithms","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","lithium","neural nets","nonlinear filters","pattern recognition","power engineering computing","power filters","secondary cells","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complementary cooperation","dual extended Kalman filter","pattern recognition","state-of-charge","capacity estimation","state-of-health prediction","electrochemical characteristics","Li-ion batteries","Hamming neural network","discharging/charging voltage pattern","capacity pattern","statistical analysis","arbitrary battery","Li"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual extended Kalman filter (DEKF)","Hamming network","pattern recognition","state-of-charge (SOC)","state-of-health (SOH)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783519/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Complementary Cooperation Algorithm Based on DEKF Combined With Pattern Recognition for SOC/Capacity Estimation and SOH Prediction","volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5783519/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12409239","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complementary Cooperation Algorithm Based on DEKF Combined With Pattern Recognition for SOC/Capacity Estimation and SOH Prediction","sourcePdf":"tpel-kim-2158554-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094059S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6099646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"6099646","articleId":"5783519","onlineDate":"02 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5783521,"authors":[{"name":"Keyvan Zarifi","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique-\u00c9nergie, Mat\u00e9riaux, et T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (INRS-EMT), Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5978836/5783521/5783521-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Keyvan Zarifi (S'04\u2013M'08) received the Ph.D. degree (with the highest hons.) in electrical and computer engineering from Darmstadt University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany, in 2007.","He has held research appointments in the Department of Communication Systems, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany, in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, and in \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure d'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 (Sup\u00e9lec), Gif-sur-Yvette, France.

All sources transmit to the relay in a shared channel in the first transmission phase. Then, the relay linearly processes its received signal vector using \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n relaying matrices and retransmits the resultant signals towards the destinations in dedicated channels in the second transmission phase. The goal is to jointly optimize the sources' transmit powers and the relaying matrices such that the worst normalized signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n destinations is maximized while the relays' transmit powers in the dedicated channels as well as the sources' individual and total transmit powers do not exceed predetermined thresholds. It is shown that the jointly optimal sources' transmit powers and the relaying matrices are the solutions to an optimization problem with a nonconvex objective function and multiple nonconvex constraints. To solve this problem, it is first proved that all normalized SINRs are equal at the optimal point of the objective function. Then, the optimization problem is transformed through multiple stages into an equivalent problem that is amenable to an iterative solution. Finally, an efficient iterative algorithm is developed that offers the jointly optimal sources' transmit powers and the relaying matrices. An extension to the above problem is then studied in the case when the cooperative communication network acts as a cognitive system that is expected to operate such that its interfering effect on the primary users is below some admissibility thresholds. In such a case, the sources' and relay's transmit powers should further satisfy some additional constraints that compel a new technique to tackle the problem of the joint optimization of the sources' transmit powers and the relaying matrices. An iterative solution to the latter problem is also proposed and the efficiency and the high rate of convergence of the proposed iterative algorithms in both the original and the cognitive cases are verified by simulation examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783521/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2011","volume":"59","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"12205557","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783521/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Jointly Optimal Source Power Control and Relay Matrix Design in Multipoint-to-Multipoint Cooperative Communication Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jointly Optimal Source Power Control and Relay Matrix Design in Multipoint-to-Multipoint Cooperative Communication Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-zarifi-2158426-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105537S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5978836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5978836","articleId":"5783521","onlineDate":"02 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5783524,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel O.

Based on an interface between the antenna model and the propagation channel model, the ergodic capacity is considered as the objective function of the MIMO array optimization. Simulation results corroborate the importance of polarization and antenna pattern diversities for MIMO in small terminals. Our results also show that the electromagnetic coupling effect can be exploited by the optimizer to decrease signal correlation and increase MIMO capacity.

New low-complexity maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) data detection algorithms are proposed based on sequential detection with optimal ordering (SDOO) and sequential detection with successive cancellation (SDSC). The received signal vector is optimally decomposed into reduced dimensional subobservations by exploiting the banded structure of the frequency-domain channel matrix whose bandwidth is a parameter to be adjusted according to the speed of the mobile terminal. The data symbols are then detected by the proposed algorithms in a computationally efficient way by means of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique with Gibbs sampling. The impact of the imperfect channel state information (CSI) on the bit error rate (BER) performance of these algorithms is investigated analytically and by computer simulations. A detailed computational complexity investigation and simulation results indicate that, particularly, the algorithm based on SDSC has significant performance and complexity advantages and is very robust against channel estimation errors compared with existing suboptimal detection and equalization algorithms proposed earlier in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2158564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5948446/05783526.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2158564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5948446","startPage":"2849","endPage":"2857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity MAP-Based Successive Data Detection for Coded OFDM Systems Over Highly Mobile Wireless Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity MAP-Based Successive Data Detection for Coded OFDM Systems Over Highly Mobile Wireless Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783526/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"6","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12157644","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5783526/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity MAP-Based Successive Data Detection for Coded OFDM Systems Over Highly Mobile Wireless Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-dogan-2158564-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102927S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5948446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5948446","articleId":"5783526","onlineDate":"02 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5783528,"authors":[{"name":"Quang Duy La","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6017249/5783528/5783528-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Quang Duy La (S'09) received the B.Eng. degree (with first-class honors) in 2008 from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering under the Nanyang President's Research Scholarship.","His research interests lie in game theory, optimization techniques, and distributed algorithms for wireless communications and radio resource allocation."]},"firstName":"Quang Duy","lastName":"La","id":"37398129700"},{"name":"Yong Huat Chew","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6017249/5783528/5783528-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Huat Chew (M'97) received the B.Eng., M.Eng., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore.","Since 1996, he has been with the Institute for Infocomm Research (formerly also known as Centre for Wireless Communications, NUS, and Institute for Communications Research), Agency for Science, Technology, and Research, where he is currently a Senior Scientist.

Despite that, managing such large-scale networks while maintaining fair and efficient spectrum usage poses a great challenge, mainly due to cochannel interference from the spatially reusable subcarrier. This paper considers the problem of interference minimization in such a scenario from a game-theoretical viewpoint. A general framework that defines the distributed OFDMA-based spectrum access problem is presented. Next, our game-theoretical analysis shows that the proposed interference-minimizing utility function exhibits the properties of a potential game. Given a deterministic number of subcarriers by each player, there exists a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium solution, and therefore, convergence can be guaranteed via sequential best-response dynamics. Our simulation results verify the analysis, and at the same time, the fairness and optimality of the solutions obtained through the proposed game are examined.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Interference-Minimization Potential Game for OFDMA-Based Distributed Spectrum Sharing Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2158596","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6017249/05783528.pdf","startPage":"3374","endPage":"3385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2158596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017249","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783528/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"An Interference-Minimization Potential Game for OFDMA-Based Distributed Spectrum Sharing Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5783528/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12219090","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Interference-Minimization Potential Game for OFDMA-Based Distributed Spectrum Sharing Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-soong-2158596-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112029S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6017249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6017249","articleId":"5783528","onlineDate":"02 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5783541,"authors":[{"name":"Sharad Sinha","affiliation":["Center of High Performance Embedded Systems, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Sharad","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37534467700"},{"name":"Thambipillai Srikanthan","affiliation":["Center of High Performance Embedded Systems, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Thambipillai","lastName":"Srikanthan","id":"37266928200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8499-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8500-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8498-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5783541","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Registers","Hardware","High level synthesis","Mathematical model","Algorithm design and analysis","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high level synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high level synthesis","transcendental function","C/C++ code","elementary algebraic operation","high performance computing","parallelism extraction","precision analysis","latency","data sampling time","drop-in low level module","computational kernel","GPS application"]}],"abstract":"High level synthesis using C/C++ code of applications is rapidly gaining ground.

The framework encompasses parallelism extraction, bounds, bit-width and precision analysis, and use of efficient low level implementations for high level synthesis.

This work presents a novel energy-aware hardware clustering algorithm with a performance estimator for on-chip bus based architectures during high level synthesis, to enhance the quality of solutions for implementing power management systems.

Accuracy analysis shows that the proposed converter can achieve an error range and percent error range of only 0.0319 and 2.337%, respectively, which outperforms the previously proposed methods with one-region and multi-region shift-and-add schemes. We have synthesized the proposed logarithmic converter using 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology, and have estimated the area and time complexities. The proposed design offers 9.4% less area-delay product, compared to the best of the existing two-region logarithmic conversion method with nearly 44% less error range with comparable area consumptions. It involves 62.7, and 60.1% less area-delay product than the existing four-region and six-region logarithmic conversion methods, respectively. The proposed converter could be used to ease the area- and time-consuming multiplications, divisions and non-linear function evaluations for real-time digital signal processing and soft-computing

It requires characterization of unique probabilistic blocks to predict the error rates of a multi-block cascade structure. While the technique was shown to work for a probabilistic carry-select adder, the technique needs a new model to work in a Wallace Tree Multiplier (WTM) where error propagates not only along the carry bit but also along the sum bit of the basic full adder building block utilized. In this paper we present a new model for characterization of probabilistic circuits/blocks and present a procedure to find and characterize unique circuits/blocks. Unlike prior approaches, our new model distinguishes distinct filtering effects per output. We apply the proposed model to a WTM and show that using our model, the methodology using a cascade structure can predict WTM error-rates with reasonable accuracy in PCMOS.","doi":"10.1109/VDAT.2011.5783561","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test","pdfPath":"/iel5/5776768/5783538/05783561.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VDAT.2011.5783561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling multi-output filtering effects in PCMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783561/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling multi-output filtering effects in PCMOS","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12035414","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783561/","conferenceDate":"25-28 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling multi-output filtering effects in PCMOS","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"PS18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074618S","chronDate":"25-28 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5776768","isNumber":"5783538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5776768","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5783538","articleId":"5783561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5783576,"authors":[{"name":"Huawei Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Computer System and Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huawei","lastName":"Li","id":"37281090900"},{"name":"Dawen Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Computer System and Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dawen","lastName":"Xu","id":"37064999500"},{"name":"Kwang-Ting Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kwang-Ting","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38183117700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8499-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8500-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8498-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5783576","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":345},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Graphics processing unit","Instruction sets","Delay","Integrated circuit modeling","Logic gates","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","fault simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU-accelerated fault simulation","general-purpose computing platform","compute-intensive EDA applications","GPU-based one- to n-detection fault simulator","-simulation-based test selection applications","commercial ATPG tools"]}],"abstract":"GPUs have recently been explored as a new general-purpose computing platform, which are suitable for the acceleration of compute-intensive EDA applications.

Both the simulation and measurement data suggests our polar TX design achieves the highest PAE among the state-of-the-art Si-based OFDM polar TX systems reported in the literature.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon germanium","WiMAX","CMOS integrated circuits","Power amplifiers","Radio frequency","BiCMOS integrated circuits","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","mobile radio","radio transmitters","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["highly efficient RF polar transmitter","power amplifier","CMOS envelope tracking amplifier","mobile WiMAX","large-signal envelope-tracking polar transmitter","monolithic cascode","TSMC","BiCMOS technology","discrete components","discrete envelope amplifier","power added efficiency","wavelength 0.35 mum","SiGe"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VDAT.2011.5783610","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test","pdfPath":"/iel5/5776768/5783538/05783610.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VDAT.2011.5783610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A highly-efficient RF polar transmitter using SiGe power amplifier and CMOS envelope-tracking amplifier for mobile WiMAX","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A highly-efficient RF polar transmitter using SiGe power amplifier and CMOS envelope-tracking amplifier for mobile WiMAX","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783610/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783610/","accessionNumber":"12035455","conferenceDate":"25-28 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 April 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A highly-efficient RF polar transmitter using SiGe power amplifier and CMOS envelope-tracking amplifier for mobile WiMAX","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"6W34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057436S","chronDate":"25-28 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5776768","isNumber":"5783538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5776768","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5783538","articleId":"5783610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5783611,"authors":[{"name":"Hailong Jiao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Hailong","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37399495600"},{"name":"Volkan Kursun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Volkan","lastName":"Kursun","id":"37267138900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8499-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8500-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8498-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5783611","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Arrays","Logic gates","Transistors","Circuit stability","CMOS integrated circuits","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit noise","leakage currents","memory architecture","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymmetrical ground gating","low leakage","data robust sleep mode","asymmetrical ground gated 7T SRAM circuit technique","leakage currents","noise immunity","idle memory banks","write assist scheme","write margin","leakage power consumption","data stability","ground gated SRAM circuits","CMOS technology","asymmetrical memory circuit","asymmetrical SRAM ground gating technique","size 80 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MTCMOS","SRAM","data stability","noise","leakage power","write margin","write assist scheme"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783611","abstract":"A new asymmetrical ground gated 7T SRAM circuit technique is presented in this paper to lower leakage currents and enhance noise immunity in idle memory banks.

CMOS CT detectors have been demonstrated with WDR and quantum-limited noise. However, existing CMOS CT detectors have low linearity, which cause artifacts during the image reconstruction. They also require high-resolution off-chip analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to quantize the WDR. In this work, a new synchronous partial quantization technique is developed for highly-linear CMOS CT detectors. System-level and circuit-level innovations enable the new detector to extend the dynamic range with constant potential well size, which results in high linearity. The new monolithic detector includes a low-resolution ADC to quantize the residual voltage. A prototype detector is fabricated in a 0.35 \u03bcm CMOS process. The new detector has 75.5% geometrical detective quantum efficiency with the ADC and the voltage reference. Measurements show the detector can quantize signal currents from 6 pA to 63.4 nA with relative deviation lower than 0.06% at 1.1 kHz frame rate, which removes the detector-induced artifacts after the image reconstruction.

It consists of the agile two-axis gimbals, the high performance fine-pointing-mechanism, the optical coarse acquisition sensor, and the optical fine tracking sensor. In the conventional tracking control systems, the two-axis gimbals is combined with the narrow range actuator for the fine pointing control, and it have the role of the coarse pointing control based on the GPS position and the body attitude. The each motion of the tracking mechanisms, therefore, is mutually disturbed by the individual control algorithms, and the obtained tracking accuracy is restricted by each motion. To improve the control performance of this two-stage type, the synchronized tracking-control system is proposed. The features of the system are the cooperative/predictive control using the each control/detective signals, and the improvement of the performance for disturbances, with the hollow-structured and rapid two-axis mirror gimbals. This control scheme is applied for the developed tracking control system, and makes it possible to achieve Free-Space Optical Communications. The paper shows the system configuration, the control algorithms and strategy for Free-Space Optical Communications, and the effect of the proposed control system by the several test results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783655/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783655/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12035327","conferenceDate":"11-13 May 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The new tracking control system for Free-Space Optical Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The new tracking control system for Free-Space Optical Communications","confLoc":"Santa Monica, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p122yamashita.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071487S","chronDate":"11-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5776394","isNumber":"5783648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5776394","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5783648","articleId":"5783655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5783660,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Plank","affiliation":["Institute of Broadband Communications, University of Technology, Graz, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Plank","id":"37318452300"},{"name":"Erich Leitgeb","affiliation":["Institute of Broadband Communications, University of Technology, Graz, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Erich","lastName":"Leitgeb","id":"37283581100"},{"name":"Markus Loeschnigg","affiliation":["EDV-Dienstleistungen GmbH, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Loeschnigg","id":"38075670000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9685-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9686-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9684-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5783660","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1014},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783660","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber communication","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Optical attenuators","Quantum cascade lasers","Attenuation","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","modulation coding","optical links","quantum cascade lasers","space communication links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free space optical link","wavelength analysis","performance evaluation criteria","optical wavelength","deep space FSO link","near-Earth FSO link","optical signal propagation","cost action IC-0802","FSO channel","atmospheric effect","semiconductor quantum cascade laser","modulation scheme","coding scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free Space Optics","attenuation effects","coding","modulation","wavelengths","laser safety","channel modelling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSOS.2011.5783660","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Space Optical Systems and Applications (ICSOS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Space Optical Systems and Applications (ICSOS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5776394/5783648/05783660.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSOS.2011.5783660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent developments on free space optical links and wavelength analysis","abstract":"New results derived from the research in the field of Free Space Optics (FSO) for the qualification of different wavelengths with reference to space applications are presented.

Some optical signal propagation experiments through the atmosphere (including the recent investigations in airborne and satellite application for FSO) are also shown.

Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCLs) are currently experiencing a strong progression. Semiconductor quantum cascade lasers can operate at various wavelengths between 3 \u03bcm up to 17 \u03bcm what makes them attractive in view of the 10 \u03bcm technology.

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is currently investigating the benefits of a ground based hybrid RF and deep space optical terminal based on limited modification of existing 34 meter antenna designs. The ideal design would include as large an optical aperture as technically practical and cost effective, cause minimal impact to RF performance, and remain cost effective even when compared to a separate optical terminal of comparable size. Numerous trades and architectures have been considered, including shared RF and optical apertures having aspheric optics and means to separate RF and optical signals, plus, partitioned apertures in which various zones of the primary are dedicated to optical reception. A design based on the latter is emphasized in this paper, employing spherical primary optics and a new version of a \u201cclamshell\u201d corrector that is optimized to fit within the limited space between the antenna sub-reflector and the existing apex structure that supports the sub-reflector. The mechanical design of the hybrid accommodates multiple spherical primary mirror panels in the central 11 meters of the antenna, and integrates the clamshell corrector and optical receiver modules with antenna hardware using existing attach points to the maximum extent practical. When an optical collection area is implemented on a new antenna, it is possible to design the antenna structure to accommodate the additional weight of optical mirrors providing an equivalent aperture of several meters diameter. The focus of our near term effort is to use optics with the 34 meter DSS-13 antenna at Goldstone to demonstrate spatial optical acquisition and tracking capability using an optical system that is temporarily integrated into the antenna.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid RF / optical communication terminal with spherical primary optics for optical reception","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Space Optical Systems and Applications (ICSOS)","doi":"10.1109/ICSOS.2011.5783663","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Space Optical Systems and Applications (ICSOS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5776394/5783648/05783663.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSOS.2011.5783663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783648","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid RF / optical communication terminal with spherical primary optics for optical reception","conferenceDate":"11-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783663/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12035335","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid RF / optical communication terminal with spherical primary optics for optical reception","confLoc":"Santa Monica, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p171charles.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058725S","chronDate":"11-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5776394","isNumber":"5783648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5776394","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5783648","articleId":"5783663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5783675,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel E.

The high intensity laser power beaming (HILPB) system enables long range optical `refueling' of electric platforms such as micro unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAV), airships, robotic exploration missions and spacecraft platforms. To further advance the HILPB technology, the focus of this investigation is to determine the optimal laser wavelength to be used with the HILPB receiver, which utilizes vertical multi-junction (VMJ) photovoltaic cells. Frequency optimization of the laser system is necessary in order to maximize the conversion efficiency at continuous high intensities, and thus increase the delivered power density of the HILPB system. Initial spectral characterizations of the device performed at the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) indicate the approximate range of peak optical-to-electrical conversion efficiencies, but these data sets represent transient conditions under lower levels of illumination. Extending these results to high levels of steady state illumination, with attention given to the compatibility of available commercial off-the-shelf semiconductor laser sources and atmospheric transmission constraints is the primary focus of this paper. Experimental hardware results utilizing high power continuous wave (CW) semiconductor lasers at four different operational frequencies near the indicated band gap of the photovoltaic VMJ cells are presented and discussed. In addition, the highest receiver power density achieved to date is demonstrated using a single photovoltaic VMJ cell, which provided an exceptionally high electrical output of 13.6 W/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n at an optical-to-electrical conversion efficiency of 24 %.

High PIE comes at a price of low dimensional information efficiency (DIE), measured in bits per spatio-temporal-polarization mode. If only temporal modes are used, then DIE translates directly to bandwidth efficiency. In this paper, the DIE vs. PIE tradeoffs for known modulations and receiver structures are compared to the ultimate quantum limit, and analytic approximations are found in the limit of high PIE. This analysis shows that known structures fall short of the maximum attainable DIE by a factor that increases linearly with PIE for high PIE. The capacity of the Dolinar receiver is derived for binary coherent-state modulations and computed for the case of on off keying (OOK). The DIE vs. PIE tradeoff for this case is improved only slightly compared to OOK with photon counting. An adaptive rule is derived for an additive local oscillator that maximizes the mutual information between a receiver and a transmitter that selects from a set of coherent states. For binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), this is shown to be equivalent to the operation of the Dolinar receiver. The Dolinar receiver is extended to make adaptive measurements on a coded sequence of coherent state symbols. Information from previous measurements is used to adjust the a priori probabilities of the next symbols. The adaptive Dolinar receiver does not improve the DIE vs. PIE tradeoff compared to independent transmission and Dolinar reception of each symbol.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and

As an alternative satisfying high-bandwidth demands of future interplanetary communications, while keeping the system cost and power consumption reasonably low, in this invited paper, we describe the use of orbital angular momentum (OAM) as an additional degree of freedom. The OAM is associated with azimuthal phase of the complex electric field. Because OAM eigenstates are orthogonal the can be used as basis functions for multidimensional signaling. The OAM modulation and multiplexing can, therefore, be used, in combination with other degrees of freedom, to solve the high-bandwidth requirements of future deep-space and near-Earth optical communications. The main challenge for OAM deep-space communication represents the link between a spacecraft probe and the Earth station because in the presence of atmospheric turbulence the orthogonality between OAM states is not longer preserved.

We refer to this as RF over Optical (RFoO). Different from conventional relay systems, we adopt RF band phase shift beamforming to adjust the initial phases of the RF signal before modulating it into the optical band. As a benefit, we are able to control the energy of the transmitted signal to concentrate it in desired areas. To reduce overhead and device loss we designed a simplified beamforming process which is based upon a predefined beam codebook. The relay station sends a series of `training sequences' using each pre-defined beam pattern. Mobile devices estimate the Signal-To-Noise (SNR) ratio of these `training sequences' to determine the optimal beam pattern, then informs the relay station of the optimal pattern. By properly designing the beam codebook, the proposed system is capable of providing wider coverage of a service area with multiple beams, and achieving stronger received power at the mobile terminal than non-beamformed radiation system. Compared to other beam control schemes, the proposed scheme is easy to implement and allows for very quick beam changes. We provide a theoretical analysis followed by computer simulation. Our simulation results show that this system can effectively enhance the received power and improve the BER performance of Optical Wireless Communications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783695/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12035367","publicationDate":"May 2011","conferenceDate":"11-13 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783695/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel RF signal beamforming scheme over Optical Wireless Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel RF signal beamforming scheme over Optical Wireless Communications","confLoc":"Santa Monica, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p346liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073095S","chronDate":"11-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5776394","isNumber":"5783648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5776394","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5783648","articleId":"5783695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5783696,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Gregory","affiliation":["Information and Coding Theory Laboratory, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Gregory","id":"38325826500"},{"name":"Peter Adam Hoeher","affiliation":["ComSupport GbR, Heikendorf, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter Adam","lastName":"Hoeher","id":"37273574400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9685-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9686-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9684-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5783696","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783696","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Encoding","Radio frequency","Receivers","Multiplexing","Apertures","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","channel coding","optical links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive channel coding","maritime FSO channels","RF feedback link","free-space optical data links","atmospheric turbulence","network availability","microwave backup link","maritime environment","multiaperture FSO links","scintillation index","adaptive coding"]}],"abstract":"Free-space optical data links (FSO) can provide high bandwidth and secure data transmission.

An architectural perspective focusing on high-level drivers, systems, and related operations concepts is provided. Detailed subsystem and component topics are not addressed. A brief overview of past ideas and architectural concepts sets the stage for current developments. Current requirements that might drive a transition from radio frequencies to optical communications are examined. These drivers include mission demand for data rates and/or data volumes; spectrum to accommodate such data rates; and desired power, mass, and cost benefits. As is typical, benefits come with associated challenges. For optical communications, these include atmospheric effects, link availability, pointing, and background light. The paper describes how NASA's Space Communication and Navigation Office will respond to the drivers, achieve the benefits, and mitigate the challenges, as documented in its Optical Communications Roadmap. Some nontraditional architectures and operations concepts are advanced in an effort to realize benefits and mitigate challenges as quickly as possible. Radio frequency communications is considered as both a competitor to and a partner with optical communications. The paper concludes with some suggestions for two affordable first steps that can yet evolve into capable architectures that will fulfill the vision inherent in optical communications.","doi":"10.1109/ICSOS.2011.5783707","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Space Optical Systems and Applications (ICSOS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Space Optical Systems and Applications (ICSOS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5776394/5783648/05783707.pdf","startPage":"410","endPage":"423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSOS.2011.5783707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep-space optical communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783707/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Deep-space optical communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12035379","htmlLink":"/document/5783707/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2011","conferenceDate":"11-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep-space optical communications","confLoc":"Santa Monica, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p410cesarone.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055174S","chronDate":"11-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5776394","isNumber":"5783648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5776394","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5783648","articleId":"5783707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5783710,"authors":[{"name":"Kyung-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["Division of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Kyung-Hwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37880195200"},{"name":"Takeshi Higashino","affiliation":["Division of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Higashino","id":"37295307400"},{"name":"Katsutoshi Tsukamoto","affiliation":["Division of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsutoshi","lastName":"Tsukamoto","id":"37289602800"},{"name":"Shozo Komaki","affiliation":["Division of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Shozo","lastName":"Komaki","id":"37297962500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9685-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9686-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9684-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5783710","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":369},"abstract":"This paper proposes a Butterworth-type spectral model of optical scintillation to design a terrestrial free-space optical (FSO) link.

By using multiple transceivers per node and automatically detecting neighbor nodes that are in LOS each other, we showed how to maintain the LOS alignment on FSO nodes. In this paper, we present a prototype implementation of such multi-transceiver electronically-steered communication structures to measure the performance of a voice file transfer over such multi-transceiver systems.

With increasing sizes of chips, higher integration involving IP cores and the need for patterns targeting multiple fault models for better defect coverage in newer technologies, the issues of adequate coverage and reasonable test data volume and application time dominate the economics of test. We address the problem of generating compact set of test patterns across multiple fault models. Traditional approaches use separate ATPG for each fault models and minimize patterns either during pattern generation through static or dynamic compaction, or after pattern generation by simulating all patterns over all fault models for static compaction. We propose a novel ATPG technique where all fault models of interest are concurrently targeted in a single ATPG run. Patterns are generated in small intervals, each consisting of 16, 32 or 64 patterns. In each interval fault model specific ATPG setups generate separate pattern sets for their respective fault model. An effectiveness criterion then selects exactly one of those pattern sets. The selected set covers untargeted faults that would have required the most additional patterns. Pattern generation intervals are repeated until required coverage for faults of all models of interest is achieved. The sum total of all selected interval pattern sets is the overall test set for the DUT. Experiments on industrial circuits show pattern count reductions of 21% to 68%. The technique is independent of any special ATPG tool or scan compression technique and requires no change or additional support in an existing ATPG system.","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2011.5783735","publicationTitle":"29th VLSI Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"29th VLSI Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5772241/5783722/05783735.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2011.5783735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783722","startPage":"285","endPage":"290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient test data reduction technique through dynamic pattern mixing across multiple fault models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient test data reduction technique through dynamic pattern mixing across multiple fault models","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783735/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12035271","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5783735/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient test data reduction technique through dynamic pattern mixing across multiple fault models","confLoc":"Dana Point, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"12a1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07046S","chronDate":"1-5 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5772241","isNumber":"5783722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5772241","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5783722","articleId":"5783735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5783748,"authors":[{"name":"Kanad Basu","affiliation":["Computer and Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Kanad","lastName":"Basu","id":"37856472700"},{"name":"Prabhat Mishra","affiliation":["Computer and Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Prabhat","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37265890400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-656-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-657-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-655-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"CD","value":"1093-0167"}],"articleNumber":"5783748","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":399},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Data compression","Buffer storage","Compression algorithms","Error analysis","Silicon","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","integrated circuit testing","logic testing","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trace data compression","statically selected dictionary","post-silicon validation","pre-silicon phase","internal signals","post-silicon debug","signal states","trace buffers","debug observation window","trace signals","dictionary based compression techniques","static dictionary","dynamic dictionaries","hardware overhead","dictionary size"]}],"abstract":"Post-silicon validation and debug have gained importance in recent years to track down errors that have escaped the pre-silicon phase. Limited observability of internal signals during post-silicon debug necessitates the storage of signal states in real time. Trace buffers are used to store these states. To increase the debug observation window, it is essential to compress these trace signals, so that trace data over larger number of cycles can be stored in the trace buffer while keeping its size constant. In this paper, we propose several dictionary based compression techniques for trace data compression that takes account of the fact that the difference between golden and erroneous trace data is small. Therefore, the static dictionary selected based on golden trace data can provide notably better compression performance than the dynamic dictionaries selected in the current approaches. This will also significantly reduce the hardware overhead by reducing the dictionary size. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach can provide up to 60% better compression compared to existing approaches, while reducing the architecture overhead by 84%.","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2011.5783748","publicationTitle":"29th VLSI Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"29th VLSI Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5772241/5783722/05783748.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2011.5783748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783722","startPage":"14","endPage":"19","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient trace data compression using statically selected dictionary","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient trace data compression using statically selected dictionary","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783748/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12035284","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5783748/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient trace data compression using statically selected dictionary","confLoc":"Dana Point, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1a3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058919S","chronDate":"1-5 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5772241","isNumber":"5783722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5772241","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5783722","articleId":"5783748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5783749,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Jen Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Zhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Jen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37421500300"},{"name":"Jin-Fu Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Zhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jin-Fu","lastName":"Li","id":"37279861800"},{"name":"Ji-Jan Chen","affiliation":["Information and Communication Research Laboratory (ICL), Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ji-Jan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37351180500"},{"name":"Ding-Ming Kwai","affiliation":["Information and Communication Research Laboratory (ICL), Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ding-Ming","lastName":"Kwai","id":"37294410600"},{"name":"Yung-Fa Chou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Fa","lastName":"Chou","id":"37265084400"},{"name":"Cheng-Wen Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Wen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37276423200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-656-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-657-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-655-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"CD","value":"1093-0167"}],"articleNumber":"5783749","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Through-silicon vias","CMOS technology","Random access memory","Logic gates","Array signal processing","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit testing","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self-test scheme","post-bond test","3D IC","three-dimensional integrated circuit","2D IC","BIST","CMOS technology","TSV array","IEEE 1500-based test approach","size 0.18 mum"]}],"abstract":"Three-dimensional (3D) integration using through silicon via (TSV) has been widely acknowledged as one future integrated-circuit (IC) technology. A 3D IC including multiple dies connected with TSVs offers many benefits over current 2D ICs. However, the testing of 3D ICs is much more difficult than that of 2D ICs. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective built-in self-test circuit (BIST) to test TSVs of a 3D IC. The BIST scheme, arranging the TSVs into arrays similar to memory, has the features of low test/diagnosis time and low silicon area cost.

In the recent past, there has been work on diagnosing RF device model parameters from random \u201cfrequency-rich\u201d test stimulus. In this paper, we develop a novel test stimulus generation approach which produces a compact, deterministic test stimulus in such a way that the RF DUT model parameters can be computed directly from the DUT response (called the DUT signature). This is achieved through use of a non-linear solver that adjusts the DUT model parameters iteratively until the model response to the applied test matches the observed DUT test response signature. It is shown that a small set of optimized tones in the frequency domain or an optimized transient waveform in the time domain can be used as test stimulus. It is shown how the use of embedded sensors in the RF design can expedite model parameter diagnosis. The practicality and accuracy of the proposed diagnosis approach is shown through simulations and hardware measurements.","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2011.5783755","publicationTitle":"29th VLSI Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"29th VLSI Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5772241/5783722/05783755.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2011.5783755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic test stimulus generation for accurate diagnosis of RF systems using transient response signatures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783755/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic test stimulus generation for accurate diagnosis of RF systems using transient response signatures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12035291","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783755/","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic test stimulus generation for accurate diagnosis of RF systems using transient response signatures","confLoc":"Dana Point, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2b1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071686S","chronDate":"1-5 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5772241","isNumber":"5783722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5772241","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5783722","articleId":"5783755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5783760,"authors":[{"name":"Irith Pomeranz","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Irith","lastName":"Pomeranz","id":"37276072700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-656-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-657-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-655-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"CD","value":"1093-0167"}],"articleNumber":"5783760","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boundary scan testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static test compaction","delay fault test sets","broadside tests","skewed-load tests","delay fault coverage","standard-scan circuits","mixed test sets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadside tests","scan circuits","skewed-load tests","static test compaction","transition faults"]}],"abstract":"Test sets that consist of both broadside and skewed-load tests provide improved delay fault coverage for standard-scan circuits.

In order to incorporate the DFTr techniques into the IC development cycle, they have to be practical in terms of their Trojan detection capabilities, hardware overhead, and test cost. We propose a non-invasive DFTr technique, which can detect Trojans in the presence of process variations and measurement errors. This technique can detect Trojans that are inserted in all or a subset of the ICs. It is applicable to both ASICs and FPGA implementations. Circuit paths in a design are reconfigured into ring oscillators (ROs) by adding a small amount of logic. Trojans are detected by observing the changes in the frequency of the ROs. An algorithm is provided to secure all the gates, while reducing the hardware overhead. We analyzed the coverage, area and test time overhead of the proposed DFTr technique. To demonstrate its effectiveness in the real world, the proposed technique had been validated by a red-team blue-team approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5783766/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12035301","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of ring oscillator based Design-for-Trust technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of ring oscillator based Design-for-Trust technique","confLoc":"Dana Point, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4b2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109914S","chronDate":"1-5 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5772241","isNumber":"5783722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5772241","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5783722","articleId":"5783766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5783773,"authors":[{"name":"Rudrajit Datta","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Research Center, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Rudrajit","lastName":"Datta","id":"37575455600"},{"name":"Nur A.

A novel aspect of the proposed approach is that the error correction code (ECC) is adapted over time as the number of failed cells in the phase change memory accumulates. The operating system (OS) monitors the number of errors corrected on a memory line, and when the number of errors on a line begins to exceed the strength of the ECC present, the ECC strength is adaptively increased. As this happens, the performance of the memory system gracefully degrades because more storage is taken up by check bits rather than data bits thereby reducing the effective size of a cache line since less data can be brought to the cache on each read operation to the PCM main memory. Experimental results show that the lifetime of a phase change memory can be significantly extended while keeping the fraction of data to check bits as high as possible at each stage in the lifetime of the phase change memory.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783773","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Phase change materials","Random access memory","Phase change memory","Memory management","Parity check codes","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","cache storage","error correction codes","operating systems (computers)","phase change memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase change memory lifetime","adaptive multibit error correcting code","operating system","memory line","ECC strength","check bits","cache line","read operation","PCM main memory"]}],"publicationTitle":"29th VLSI Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"29th VLSI Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5772241/5783722/05783773.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2011.5783773","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2011.5783773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing a fast and adaptive error correction scheme for increasing the lifetime of phase change memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783773/","displayDocTitle":"Designing a fast and adaptive error correction scheme for increasing the lifetime of phase change memories","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12035308","htmlLink":"/document/5783773/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing a fast and adaptive error correction scheme for increasing the lifetime of phase change memories","confLoc":"Dana Point, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"6b1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051628S","chronDate":"1-5 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5772241","isNumber":"5783722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5772241","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5783722","articleId":"5783773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5783775,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiu-Chuan Shih","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsiu-Chuan Shih","id":"38058589100"},{"name":"Ching-Yi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Yi Chen","id":"37406734300"},{"name":"Cheng-Wen Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Wen Wu","id":"37276423200"},{"name":"Chih-He Lin","affiliation":["Electronics and Optoelectronics Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-He","lastName":"Lin","id":"37065295500"},{"name":"Shyh-Shyuan Sheu","affiliation":["Electronics and Optoelectronics Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyh-Shyuan","lastName":"Sheu","id":"37410797200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-656-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-657-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-655-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"CD","value":"1093-0167"}],"articleNumber":"5783775","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":887},"abstract":"Over the past decade, the resistive memory device known as RRAM has been studied extensively in many ways, and many of its problems have been identified, discussed, and some solved. It is time to move from material, process, and device to circuit design and yield, in order to commercialize RRAM. However, as we move from resistive device to memory circuit, new problems do appear, partly because the operating conditions of resistive devices on real RRAM circuit differ from those in an experimental environment for single devices. In this paper, an over forming problem has been identified from our analysis, and we propose a solution based on training sequence. As a result, by solving the over forming problem, RRAM yield can be improved significantly.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistance","Training","Switches","Voltage measurement","Circuit faults","Electrical resistance measurement","Semiconductor device measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit yield","logic testing","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["training-based forming process","RRAM yield improvement","resistive memory device","circuit design","memory circuit","operating conditions","real RRAM circuit","single devices","over forming problem","training sequence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783775","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2011.5783775","displayPublicationTitle":"29th VLSI Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5772241/5783722/05783775.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2011.5783775","startPage":"146","endPage":"151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783722","publicationTitle":"29th VLSI Test Symposium","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training-based forming process for RRAM yield improvement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Training-based forming process for RRAM yield improvement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783775/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 2011","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783775/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12035310","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training-based forming process for RRAM yield improvement","confLoc":"Dana Point, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"6b3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081113S","chronDate":"1-5 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5772241","isNumber":"5783722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5772241","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5783722","articleId":"5783775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5783780,"authors":[{"name":"Ender Yilmaz","affiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"],"firstName":"Ender","lastName":"Yilmaz","id":"37393170600"},{"name":"Anne Meixner","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"Meixner","id":"37281297900"},{"name":"Sule Ozev","affiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"],"firstName":"Sule","lastName":"Ozev","id":"37275335200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-656-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-657-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-655-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"CD","value":"1093-0167"}],"articleNumber":"5783780","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":416},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An industrial case study of analog fault modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783780","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Circuit faults","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Computational modeling","Mathematical model","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","circuit simulation","driver circuits","fault simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog fault modeling","quality measure","defective device behavior","fault simulation","process variation","industrial SerDes TX Driver circuit","simulation time reduction","defect impact","defect severity measure"]}],"abstract":"Analog fault modeling (AFM) provides a quantitative measure of quality and insight into defective device behavior.

An adaptive error-prediction flip-flop architecture with built-in aging sensor is proposed, performing on-line monitoring of long-term performance degradation of CMOS digital systems. The main advantage is that the sensor's performance degradation works in favor of the predictive error detection. The sensor is out of the signal path. Performance error prediction is implemented by the detection of late transitions at flip-flop data input, caused by aging (namely, due to NBTI), or to physical defects activated by long lifetime operation. Such errors must not occur in safety-critical systems (automotive, health, space). A sensor insertion algorithm is also proposed, to selectively insert them in key locations in the design. Sensors can be always active or at pre-defined states. Simulation results are presented for a balanced pipeline multiplier in 65 nm CMOS technology, using Berkeley Predictive Technology Models (PTM). It is shown that the impact of aging degradation and/or PVT (Process, power supply Voltage and Temperature) variations on the sensor enhance error prediction.","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2011.5783784","publicationTitle":"29th VLSI Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"29th VLSI Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5772241/5783722/05783784.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2011.5783784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783722","startPage":"203","endPage":"208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Error-Prediction Flip-flop for performance failure prediction with aging sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Error-Prediction Flip-flop for performance failure prediction with aging sensors","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783784/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12035319","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5783784/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Error-Prediction Flip-flop for performance failure prediction with aging sensors","confLoc":"Dana Point, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8a3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058092S","chronDate":"1-5 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5772241","isNumber":"5783722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5772241","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5783722","articleId":"5783784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5783809,"authors":[{"name":"K.R.

These algorithms are compute intensive and require efficient VLSI implementation for real time applications. Bit plane coder (BPC) and MQ coder are the two cores of the EBCOT algorithm. All processes to be executed by the MQ coder are sequential in nature and hence restricts the speed of EBCOT. In this paper we propose a high speed and area efficient architecture of MQ decoder which is implemented on Virtex-2 FPGA. The implementation results show that the design operates at 142 MHz and hardware cost is very low. Estimated frame rate is 20.41 frames per second (FPS) at this frequency. On Virtex-5 device design operates at 222.8 MHz and estimated frame rate is 32.02 FPS. Hardware overhead is reduced to the great extent because shift register based renormalization unit is used which operates at high speed.","doi":"10.1109/TECHSYM.2011.5783844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Technology Students' Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Technology Students' Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5772213/5783792/05783844.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TECHSYM.2011.5783844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI implementation of MQ decoder in JPEG2000","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Jan. 2011","displayDocTitle":"VLSI implementation of MQ decoder in JPEG2000","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783844/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"12035240","conferenceDate":"14-16 Jan. 2011","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI implementation of MQ decoder in JPEG2000","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"TS11VLSI01111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051938S","chronDate":"14-16 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5772213","isNumber":"5783792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5772213","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5783792","articleId":"5783844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5783852,"authors":[{"name":"Prabir Saha","affiliation":["Bengal Engineering and Science University, Howrah, India"],"firstName":"Prabir","lastName":"Saha","id":"38068803300"},{"name":"Arindam Banerjee","affiliation":["Department of ECE, JIS College of Engineering, Kalyani, India"],"firstName":"Arindam","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"38062490400"},{"name":"Partha Bhattacharyya","affiliation":["Bengal Engineering and Science University, Howrah, India"],"firstName":"Partha","lastName":"Bhattacharyya","id":"37602922300"},{"name":"Anup Dandapat","affiliation":["Department of ETCE, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Anup","lastName":"Dandapat","id":"37394701400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8943-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8941-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8942-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5783852","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2543},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783852","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","application specific integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","digital arithmetic","multiplying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high speed ASIC design","complex multiplier","Vedic mathematics","adder-subtractor unit","propagation delay","dynamic power consumption","spice spectre","CMOS technology","size 90 nm","power 6.5 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex Multiplier","Exponent Determinant","High Speed Radix Selection Unit","Vedic Formulas"]}],"abstract":"Vedic Mathematics is the ancient methodology of Indian mathematics which has a unique technique of calculations based on 16 Sutras (Formulae). A high speed complex multiplier design (ASIC) using Vedic Mathematics is presented in this paper. The idea for designing the multiplier and adder/sub-tractor unit is adopted from ancient Indian mathematics \u201cVedas\u201d. On account of those formulas, the partial products and sums are generated in one step which reduces the carry propagation from LSB to MSB. The implementation of the Vedic mathematics and their application to the complex multiplier ensure substantial reduction of propagation delay in comparison with DA based architecture and parallel adder based implementation which are most commonly used architectures. The functionality of these circuits was checked and performance parameters like propagation delay and dynamic power consumption were calculated by spice spectre using standard 90nm CMOS technology. The propagation delay of the resulting (16, 16)\u00d7(16, 16) complex multiplier is only 4ns and consume 6.5 mW power. We achieved almost 25% improvement in speed from earlier reported complex multipliers, e.g. parallel adder and DA based architectures.","doi":"10.1109/TECHSYM.2011.5783852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TECHSYM.2011.5783852","publicationTitle":"IEEE Technology Students' Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Technology Students' Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5772213/5783792/05783852.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High speed ASIC design of complex multiplier using Vedic Mathematics","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Jan. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"High speed ASIC design of complex multiplier using Vedic Mathematics","conferenceDate":"14-16 Jan. 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"12035248","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783852/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High speed ASIC design of complex multiplier using Vedic Mathematics","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"TS11VLSI0P153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074717S","chronDate":"14-16 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5772213","isNumber":"5783792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5772213","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5783792","articleId":"5783852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5783882,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Chia Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and the Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6011598/5783882/5783882-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wen-Chia Yang (S'05) was born in Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1979.

By utilizing fuzzy logic systems to approximate unknown and desired control input signals directly instead of the unknown nonlinear functions, an output-feedback fuzzy tracking controller is designed via a backstepping approach.

This has proved challenging in the past, since segments are mainly created using spectral and size criteria that are not consistent for landslides. This paper presents an approach to select objectively parameters for a region growing segmentation technique to outline landslides as individual segments and also addresses the scale dependence of landslides and false positives occurring in a natural landscape. Multiple scale parameters were determined using a plateau objective function derived from the spatial autocorrelation and intrasegment variance analysis, allowing for differently sized features to be identified. While a high-resolution Resourcesat-1 Linear Imaging and Self Scanning Sensor IV (5.8 m) multispectral image was used to create segments for landslide recognition, terrain curvature derived from a digital terrain model based on Cartosat-1 (2.5 m) data was used to create segments for subsequent landslide classification. Here, optimal segments were used in a knowledge-based classification approach with the thresholds of diagnostic parameters derived from If-means cluster analysis, to detect landslides of five different types, with an overall recognition accuracy of 76.9%. The approach, when tested in a geomorphologically dissimilar area, recognized landslides with an overall accuracy of 77.7%, without modification to the methodology. The multiscale classification-based segment optimization procedure was also able to reduce the error of commission significantly in comparison to a single-optimal-scale approach.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2151866","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6079321/05783913.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2151866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079321","startPage":"4928","endPage":"4943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segment Optimization and Data-Driven Thresholding for Knowledge-Based Landslide Detection by Object-Based Image Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Segment Optimization and Data-Driven Thresholding for Knowledge-Based Landslide Detection by Object-Based Image Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783913/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12376448","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5783913/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segment Optimization and Data-Driven Thresholding for Knowledge-Based Landslide Detection by Object-Based Image Analysis","sourcePdf":"tgrs-martha-2151866-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134886S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6079321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"6079321","articleId":"5783913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5783916,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Minnis","affiliation":["Science Directorate, National Aeronautics and Space Administration Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6059698/5783916/5783916-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Patrick Minnis is a native of Oklahoma City, OK.

This is achieved using satellite broad-band instruments to map the top-of-atmosphere radiation fields with coincident data from satellite narrow-band imagers employed to retrieve the properties of clouds associated with those fields. This paper documents the CERES Edition-2 cloud property retrieval system used to analyze data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Visible and Infrared Scanner and by the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites covering the period 1998 through 2007. Two daytime retrieval methods are explained: the Visible Infrared Shortwave-infrared Split-window Technique for snow-free surfaces and the Shortwave-infrared Infrared Near-infrared Technique for snow or ice-covered surfaces. The Shortwave-infrared Infrared Split-window Technique is used for all surfaces at night. These methods, along with the ancillary data and empirical parameterizations of cloud thickness, are used to derive cloud boundaries, phase, optical depth, effective particle size, and condensed/frozen water path at both pixel and CERES footprint levels. Additional information is presented, detailing the potential effects of satellite calibration differences, highlighting methods to compensate for spectral differences and correct for atmospheric absorption and emissivity, and discussing known errors in the code. Because a consistent set of algorithms, auxiliary input, and calibrations across platforms are used, instrument and algorithm-induced changes in the data record are minimized. This facilitates the use of the CERES data products for studying climate-scale trends.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5783916/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12326680","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"CERES Edition-2 Cloud Property Retrievals Using TRMM VIRS and Terra and Aqua MODIS Data\u2014Part I: Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CERES Edition-2 Cloud Property Retrievals Using TRMM VIRS and Terra and Aqua MODIS Data\u2014Part I: Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tgrs-minnis-2144601-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.283694S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6059698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"327","xplore-issue":"6059698","articleId":"5783916","onlineDate":"07 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":5783917,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Minnis","affiliation":["Science Directorate, NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6059698/5783917/5783917-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Patrick Minnis a native of Oklahoma City.

For inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging, the backscattering field of a target is usually composed of contributions by a very limited amount of strong scattering centers, the number of which is much smaller than that of pixels in the image plane. In this paper, a novel framework for ISAR imaging is proposed through sparse stepped-frequency waveforms (SSFWs). By using the framework, the measurements, only at some portions of frequency subbands, are used to reconstruct full-resolution images by exploiting sparsity. This waveform strategy greatly reduces the amount of data and acquisition time and improves the antijamming capability. A new algorithm, named the sparsity-driven High-Resolution Range Profile (HRRP) synthesizer, is presented in this paper to overcome the error phase due to motion usually degrading the HHRP synthesis. The sparsity-driven HRRP synthesizer is robust to noise. The main novelty of the proposed ISAR imaging framework is twofold: 1) dividing the motion compensation into three steps and therefore allowing for very accurate estimation and 2) both sparsity and signal-to-noise ratio are enhanced dramatically by coherent integrant in cross-range before performing HRRP synthesis. Both simulated and real measured data are used to test the robustness of the ISAR imaging framework with SSFWs. Experimental results show that the framework is capable of precise reconstruction of ISAR images and effective suppression of both phase error and noise.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2151865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6059698/05783920.pdf","startPage":"4630","endPage":"4651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2151865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6059698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Resolution ISAR Imaging With Sparse Stepped-Frequency Waveforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783920","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783920/","displayDocTitle":"High-Resolution ISAR Imaging With Sparse Stepped-Frequency Waveforms","volume":"49","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317830","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783920/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Resolution ISAR Imaging With Sparse Stepped-Frequency Waveforms","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhang-2151865-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122975S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6059698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"6059698","articleId":"5783920","onlineDate":"07 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5783927,"authors":[{"name":"Youhei Hinago","affiliation":["Tokyo University of Science, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6046172/5783927/5783927-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Youhei Hinago (S'09) received the B.S.

The proposed coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) in the polar modulator converts rectangular coordinate to polar coordinate with significantly less hardware and power comparing to the existing computational intensive algorithm by employing hard wired pipeline strategy to increase the performance and to reduce the hardware size. The proposed CORDIC performs a sequence of elementary rotations using shift and add operations without multiplications, providing a highly cost effective solution. The separate distribution of angle constants to each adder permits a hard-wire solution instead of using a lookup table, and all the shifters are hard-wired. Linear interpolators to extend the sampling rate for WCDMA specification are used to decrease the operating frequency. The proposed approach reduces both size and power by integrating booth CORDIC and power amplifier on the same die. The measured average power consumption is 27 mW with 67 MHz clock and 3 V power supply.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Multiaccess communication","Phase shift keying","Spread spectrum communication","Hardware","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","code division multiple access","interpolation","low-power electronics","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","modulators","pipeline arithmetic","power amplifiers","radio transmitters","sampling methods","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS low-power digital polar modulator system integration","WCDMA transmitter","mixed mode CMOS technology","coordinate rotation digital computer","CORDIC","rectangular coordination","polar coordination","computational intensive algorithm","hard wired pipeline strategy","elementary rotation sequence","shift and add operation","linear interpolator","sampling rate","power consumption","size 0.35 mum","power 27 mW","frequency 67 MHz","voltage 3 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC)","low power","WCDMA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783928","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2158777","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6046172/05783928.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2158777","startPage":"1154","endPage":"1160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS Low-Power Digital Polar Modulator System Integration for WCDMA Transmitter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS Low-Power Digital Polar Modulator System Integration for WCDMA Transmitter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783928/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5783928/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12300510","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS Low-Power Digital Polar Modulator System Integration for WCDMA Transmitter","sourcePdf":"tie-kim-2158777-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05817S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6046172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6046172","articleId":"5783928","onlineDate":"07 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5783930,"authors":[{"name":"Esteban J.

Thus, CR is widely regarded as one of the most promising technologies for future wireless communications. To make radios and wireless networks truly cognitive, however, is by no means a simple task, and it requires collaborative effort from various research communities, including communications theory, networking engineering, signal processing, game theory, software-hardware joint design, and reconfigurable antenna and radio-frequency design. In this paper, we provide a systematic overview on CR networking and communications by looking at the key functions of the physical (PHY), medium access control (MAC), and network layers involved in a CR design and how these layers are crossly related. In particular, for the PHY layer, we will address signal processing techniques for spectrum sensing, cooperative spectrum sensing, and transceiver design for cognitive spectrum access. For the MAC layer, we review sensing scheduling schemes, sensing-access tradeoff design, spectrum-aware access MAC, and CR MAC protocols. In the network layer, cognitive radio network (CRN) tomography, spectrum-aware routing, and quality-of-service (QoS) control will be addressed. Emerging CRNs that are actively developed by various standardization committees and spectrum-sharing economics will also be reviewed. Finally, we point out several open questions and challenges that are related to the CRN design.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2158673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2158673","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6017249/05783948.pdf","startPage":"3386","endPage":"3407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive radio networking and communications: an overview","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio networking and communications: an overview","volume":"60","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783948/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12219092","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783948/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio networking and communications: an overview","sourcePdf":"tvt-liang-2158673-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.447551S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6017249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"670","xplore-issue":"6017249","articleId":"5783948","onlineDate":"07 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5783949,"authors":[{"name":"Kyeong Jin Kim","affiliation":["UWBWireless Communications Research Center, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyeong Jin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280262200"},{"name":"Theodoros A.

A novel iterative extended soft-recursive least square (IES-RLS) estimator for joint channel and frequency offset estimation is introduced. Extrinsic bit information obtained from the channel decoder and expected symbol decisions obtained from the demodulator are simultaneously exploited by the IES-RLS. The proposed receiver combines the MIMO data demodulator, the proposed channel estimator, and the channel decoder in an iterative manner to yield an improved bit error rate (BER) performance. To arrive at a feasible algorithm, the first-order linearization of the received vector signal with respect to the frequency offset is used in the IES-RLS channel estimator. The BER performance, a constellation-constrained mutual information analysis, and an EXIT chart analysis are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed receiver. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed semiblind receiver, compared with conventional semiblind receivers.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2158672","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6017249/05783949.pdf","startPage":"3156","endPage":"3168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2158672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semiblind Iterative Receiver for Coded MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783949/","displayDocTitle":"Semiblind Iterative Receiver for Coded MIMO-OFDM Systems","volume":"60","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12219093","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semiblind Iterative Receiver for Coded MIMO-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-tsiftsis-2158672-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038512S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","isNumber":"6017249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","articleId":"5783949","onlineDate":"07 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5783951,"authors":[{"name":"Joyce Kwong","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5928962/5783951/5783951-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Joyce Kwong (M'04) received the B.A.Sc. degree at the University of Waterloo in 2004, where she was awarded the Governor General's Silver Medal, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2006 and 2010 respectively.

The modulator displays similar performance to that of a standard multibit CT-\u03a3\u0394 modulator but has the complexity of a single bit design. The time-encoding quantizer (TEQ) is implemented inside a \u03a3\u0394 modulator by replacing a multibit quantizer. An innovative TEQ is used to overcome design issues in a 1.0 V supply-voltage 65 nm digital CMOS technology. The TEQ allows an exchange of amplitude-resolution by time-resolution. The approach of time-resolution alleviates the scaling difficulties of mixed-signal circuits in nano-scale technologies. The TEOC features a 63 dB dynamic-range and a peak-SNDR of 61 dB over a 20 MHz signal bandwidth. Clocked at 2.5 GHz, the complete ADC consumes 7 mW from a single 1.0 V supply, including also the reference buffers.

However, as energy saving and environmental protection become global demands and inevitable trends, wireless researchers and engineers need to shift their focus to energy-efficiency-oriented design, that is, green radio. In this article, we propose a framework for green radio research and integrate the fundamental issues that are currently scattered. The skeleton of the framework consists of four fundamental tradeoffs: deployment efficiency-energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency-energy efficiency, bandwidth-power, and delay-power. With the help of the four fundamental trade-offs, we demonstrate that key network performance/cost indicators are all strung together.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2011.5783982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2011.5783982","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5783970/05783982.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"37","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental trade-offs on green wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental trade-offs on green wireless networks","volume":"49","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5783982/","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12036175","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783982/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental trade-offs on green wireless networks","sourcePdf":"012CHENLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036812S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5783970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"830","xplore-issue":"5783970","articleId":"5783982","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5783983,"authors":[{"name":"Hanna Bogucka","affiliation":["Poznan University of Technology, Poland"],"bio":{"p":["Hanna Bogucka (hbogucka@et.put.poznan.pl) received M.

In the recent years, multicarrier modulation is being investigated as a possible candidate data transmission scheme for achieving spectrally agile wireless access in scenarios where unlicensed users temporarily \"borrow\" unoccupied licensed frequency bands while minimizing interference with spectrally adjacent signals, i.e., opportunistic wireless access. Specifically, the divide-and-conquer data transmission approach employed by multicarrier modulation makes it an attractive option for realizing wireless communication systems that do not require a single continuous transmission frequency band. In this article, we present several multicarrier transmission solutions designed for efficiently achieving opportunistic wireless access. In particular, we shall investigate two types of spectrally-agile multicarrier modulation schemes, namely, non-contiguous orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing and non-contiguous nonorthogonal frequency-division multiplexing. The viability of these two techniques employed within an opportunistic wireless access scenario is assessed using actual spectrum measurement data, and a comparative study in terms of out-of-band interference mitigation as well as implementation complexity is provided.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrally agile multicarrier waveforms for opportunistic wireless access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2011.5783994","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5783970/05783994.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2011.5783994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783970","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5783994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5783994/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"Spectrally agile multicarrier waveforms for opportunistic wireless access","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5783994/","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12036182","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrally agile multicarrier waveforms for opportunistic wireless access","sourcePdf":"024WYGLINSKILAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051435S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5783970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5783970","articleId":"5783994","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5784003,"authors":[{"name":"Oriol Sallent","affiliation":["Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC), Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Oriol Sallent (sallent@tsc.upc.edu) is Associate Professor at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

Given that many challenges have been identified when moving from the SON concept to practical implementation, this article claims the suitability to gain insight into the problem by taking advantage of optimization mechanisms in live Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks. From that perspective, this article outlines a roadmap from actual manual optimization toward the inclusion of SON concepts in future networks. In particular, an optimization framework is developed considering different stages that include the collection of inputs from different sources (network counters, measurement reports, drive tests), the tuning parameters to achieve optimization, and the optimization procedure itself. Even though the proposed framework is presented and evaluated for convenience in a UMTS context, it is rather generic and technology-agnostic and, therefore, it can be formulated as an initial reference for LTE self-optimization use cases. The proposed framework is applied to a practical coverage optimization use case supported by data extracted from a real UMTS network in a European city, illustrating the capability to automatically identify a cell with sub-optimal coverage and to provide a solution to the problem. The extension of the case study to LTE is also analyzed. Finally, as a result of the lessons learned, the article makes a projection to the LTE context by identifying the key points to be solved for the materialization of a self-optimization procedure.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2011.5784003","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5783970/05784003.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2011.5784003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783970","startPage":"172","endPage":"182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A roadmap from UMTS optimization to LTE self-optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A roadmap from UMTS optimization to LTE self-optimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784003/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12036189","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5784003/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A roadmap from UMTS optimization to LTE self-optimization","sourcePdf":"033ROMEROLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057414S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5783970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5783970","articleId":"5784003","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5784173,"authors":[{"name":"Salama S.

If the destination provides a negative acknowledgment via feedback; in this case only, the best relay among M available relays retransmits the source signal in an attempt to exploit spatial diversity by combining the signals received at the destination from the source and the best relay.

In this letter, we consider selection diversity (SD) to select the strongest link amongst the direct and N amplify-and-forward (AF) relay links. We derive new closed-form expressions for the symbol error rate (SER) in independent but not necessarily identically distributed (i.n.d.) Rayleigh fading relay channels. Our results are given as both lower bound and asymptotic expressions based on an accurate upper bound on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the relay links. Our asymptotic results provide key performance parameters such as the array gain and diversity order, which prove that a full N+1 diversity order is achieved. We show that SD can offer an array gain advantage over maximal-ratio combining which entails all the relays to transmit. Numerical results are shown to validate the analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5784175/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12206207","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SER of Multiple Amplify-and-Forward Relays with Selection Diversity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SER of Multiple Amplify-and-Forward Relays with Selection Diversity","sourcePdf":"2078-tc1108-yeoh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061982S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5986797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5986797","articleId":"5784175","onlineDate":"07 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5784178,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Gomaa","affiliation":["University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5986797/5784178/5784178-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmad Gomaa (S'09) received his B.S and M.S degrees in electronics and communications engineering from Cairo University, Egypt, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

Then, we extend our formulation to decision feedback equalizers and multiple-antenna systems. This is followed by further generalization to the channel shortening setup which is important for communication systems operating over broadband channels with long channel impulse responses. We propose a novel approach to design a sparse target impulse response.

Multi-antenna relay configurations are considered, for which the source as well as either the relay or destination have multiple antennas, and the relay operates with amplify-and-forward. We first compute the optimal transmission strategies at both the source and relay, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for which beamforming achieves capacity. To gain more insight, we then employ tools from stochastic majorization theory to characterize the impact of the destination correlation and the relay gain on the capacity and beamforming optimality range. These results demonstrate some intriguing behavior, which arises due to the joint interplay between the transmit power, relay gain, and level of correlation at the destination. It is shown, among other things, that for certain transmit powers and relay gains, the beamforming optimality region becomes independent of the destination correlation. By relaxing the beamforming optimality condition, we also derive a simple explicit upper bound which gives further insights into the joint effect of the SNR and the transmit correlation on the beamforming optimality range.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ergodic Capacity and Beamforming Optimality for Multi-Antenna Relaying with Statistical CSI","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.053111.100453","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5986797/05784179.pdf","startPage":"2119","endPage":"2131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.053111.100453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986797","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784179/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","displayDocTitle":"Ergodic Capacity and Beamforming Optimality for Multi-Antenna Relaying with Statistical CSI","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5784179/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12206209","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ergodic Capacity and Beamforming Optimality for Multi-Antenna Relaying with Statistical CSI","sourcePdf":"2119-tc1108-dharma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094456S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5986797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5986797","articleId":"5784179","onlineDate":"07 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5784199,"authors":[{"name":"Anna Petrovskaya","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/5784192/5784199/5784199-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anna Petrovskaya received the Doctorate degree in computer science from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2011.","Her research focuses on model-based Bayesian perception for robotic applications.

For robots to achieve the same feat in unstructured environments, global localization of objects via touch is required. Bayesian approaches provide the means to cope with uncertainties of the real world, but the estimation of the Bayesian posterior for the full six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) global localization problem is computationally prohibitive. We propose an efficient Bayesian approach termed Scaling Series. It is capable of solving the full problem reliably in real time. This is a Monte Carlo approach that performs a series of successive refinements coupled with annealing. We also propose an analytical measurement model, which can be computed efficiently at run time for any object represented as a polygonal mesh. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that Scaling Series drastically outperforms prior approaches. We demonstrate general applicability of the approach on five common solid objects, which are rigidly fixed during the experiments. We also consider 6-DOF localization and tracking of free-standing objects that can move during tactile exploration.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2011.2138450","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/5784192/05784199.pdf","startPage":"569","endPage":"585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2011.2138450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global Localization of Objects via Touch","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784199/","displayDocTitle":"Global Localization of Objects via Touch","volume":"27","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12047045","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5784199/","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global Localization of Objects via Touch","sourcePdf":"tro-petrovskaya-2138450-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114587S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"5784192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5784192","articleId":"5784199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5784201,"authors":[{"name":"Ashwin Alur Sreesha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, USA"],"firstName":"Ashwin Alur","lastName":"Sreesha","id":"38071877000"},{"name":"Shashank Somal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, USA"],"firstName":"Shashank","lastName":"Somal","id":"38071879500"},{"name":"I-Tai Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, USA"],"firstName":"I-Tai","lastName":"Lu","id":"37297371700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9877-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9878-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5784201","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1914},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Batteries","Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee","Performance evaluation","Smart grids","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","local area networks","low-power electronics","routing protocols","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio-based wireless sensor network","CR-WSN","smart grid utility","energy efficient designs","spectrum efficient designs","smart grid wireless applications","power saving","home area networks","power consumption","routing protocol","low power networks","lossy networks","low-latency routing support","large-scale cognitive smart grid networks","device capacity handling","selective routing","battery powered devices","spectrum sensing operation","multilayered approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Smart Grid","CR-WSN","RPL","ZigBee"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio Based Wireless Sensor Network architecture for smart grid utility","doi":"10.1109/LISAT.2011.5784201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784200","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Long Island Systems, Applications and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Long Island Systems, Applications and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5775772/5784200/05784201.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LISAT.2011.5784201","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784201","abstract":"A multi layered approach is proposed to provide energy and spectrum efficient designs of Cognitive Radio Based Wireless Sensor Networks (CR-WSN) at the smart grid utility.

Our RPL implementation handles finer aspects of the network such as asymmetry, device capacity handling which is performed through selective routing where battery powered devices are spared from spectrum sensing operation and minimum number of routes passes through it.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784201/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-6 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12047404","htmlLink":"/document/5784201/","conferenceDate":"6-6 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio Based Wireless Sensor Network architecture for smart grid utility","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio Based Wireless Sensor Network architecture for smart grid utility","confLoc":"Farmingdale, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"LuSmartGrid.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047272S","chronDate":"6-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5775772","isNumber":"5784200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5775772","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5784200","articleId":"5784201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5784214,"authors":[{"name":"Aliakbar Ghadiri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Aliakbar","lastName":"Ghadiri","id":"37421655600"},{"name":"Kambiz Moez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Kambiz","lastName":"Moez","id":"37530742500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5784214","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":616},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power transmission lines","CMOS integrated circuits","Inductors","Bandwidth","Impedance","Gain","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","distributed amplifiers","transmission lines","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact transformer-based distributed amplifier","UWB systems","transmission lines","impedance conversion","complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology","direct-current power supply","size 0.18 mum","bandwidth 3.4 GHz to 11 GHz","size 0.76 mm","size 0.4 mm","power 38 mW","voltage 1.8 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broad-band amplifier","distributed amplifier (DA)","transformer-based DA","ultrawideband (UWB) system"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents a new compact structure of distributed amplifiers (DAs) employing integrated transformers to lower the impedance values of input and output transmission lines.

Spectrum sensing is the first step for cognitive radio and it needs to detect signals presence under strict requirement such that secondary users (unlicensed users) can use the licensed spectral band without interfering primary users (licensed users). In this paper, we implement spectrum sensing in real environment and verify two present algorithms based on the time-covariance matrix. For the capability of sensing the spectrum, we make use of Software Defined Radio (SDR), which provides the ability to modify the hardware characteristics of the system and the flexibility for programming. Moreover, GNU Radio is an open source software toolkit which provides different functions that supports SDR. The need for low cost hardware platform for an SDR necessitated development of Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP). Combining GNU Radio and USRP, can be a very powerful tool to develop SDR based wireless communication systems and to carry out various experiments and testing. With the premise of high correlations of primary users and low correlations of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) between two different samples, we evaluated two kinds of present methods based on time-covariance matrix called Covariance (COV) method and Maximum-to-Minimum Eigenvalue (MME) method. To combat the noise uncertainty, COV uses the ratio between the time correlation and the signal energy as the signal detection indicator; and MME uses the ratio of maximum to minimum eigenvalues of the covariance matrix to detect the signal presence. We analyze the performance of these methods on GNU radio with USRP. Unlike energy detection (ED), COV and MME can do spectrum sensing without any prior knowledge of primary signal and noise power. Furthermore, it can combat noise uncertainty, of which ED is devoid. We present the performance of these two methods compared with ED for BPSK modulation as a primary signal to check the feasibility of these two algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/LISAT.2011.5784217","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Long Island Systems, Applications and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5775772/5784200/05784217.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LISAT.2011.5784217","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Long Island Systems, Applications and Technology Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sensing based on time covariance matrix using GNU radio and USRP for cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-6 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sensing based on time covariance matrix using GNU radio and USRP for cognitive radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784217/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5784217/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12047405","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","conferenceDate":"6-6 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sensing based on time covariance matrix using GNU radio and USRP for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Farmingdale, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"LuUSRP.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073569S","chronDate":"6-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5775772","isNumber":"5784200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5775772","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5784200","articleId":"5784217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5784228,"authors":[{"name":"Robert A.

The FCC's National Broadband Plan indicated that mobile data traffic in North America would increase by roughly 20 to 45 times between 2009 and 2014, and current data suggests these numbers may be exceeded. This paper examines how wireless technology can address the bandwidth challenge. We consider not only the track of cellular technology, but new approaches that promise improved spectral efficiency, use new spectrum, and rely on new network architectures. We recap cellular evolution from second generation through LTE-Advanced, address enhancements such as Coordinated Multipoint Transmission (CoMP) and examine other innovative multi-cell technology. More ambitious changes to cellular architecture such as relay nodes and terminal-to-terminal communications are discussed. Pico-cells, femto-cells, and forward-looking dense deployments are presented as promising approaches. New spectrum, including the use of TV white space is considered. We provide a quantitative assessment -perhaps a goal or perhaps another prediction - of what can be achieved.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LISAT.2011.5784228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784200","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Long Island Systems, Applications and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5775772/5784200/05784228.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The bandwidth crunch: Can wireless technology meet the skyrocketing demand for mobile data?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-6 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5784228/","displayDocTitle":"The bandwidth crunch: Can wireless technology meet the skyrocketing demand for mobile data?","conferenceDate":"6-6 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12036486","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The bandwidth crunch: Can wireless technology meet the skyrocketing demand for mobile data?","confLoc":"Farmingdale, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"DiFazio.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069721S","chronDate":"6-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5775772","isNumber":"5784200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5775772","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5784200","articleId":"5784228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5784244,"authors":[{"name":"Yongwoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Melville, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yongwoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"38067633600"},{"name":"Peter Voltz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Melville, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Voltz","id":"37267905500"},{"name":"Philip Pietraski","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications LLC, Melville, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Pietraski","id":"37282293400"},{"name":"Rui Yang","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications LLC, Melville, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291106300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9877-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9878-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5784244","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"abstract":"In this paper we describe and simulate an accurate Bit Error Rate (BER) estimator for a chip level Wiener equalizer and combined equalizer/interference canceller for employment with the CDMA MIMO High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) feature of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). In the 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO system two data streams may be transmitted in the downlink to each user equipment (UE) using assigned multiple orthogonal CDMA codes of Spreading Factor 16. The two streams are mapped to the two transmit antennas via a 2 \u00d7 2 weight matrix. Since the two streams use the same set of CDMA codes, it results in some direct interference between the two data streams at the receiver. The signal constellations from the two data streams interfere with each other and this complicates the BER estimation process. Treating this interference as AWGN is not sufficient for accurate BER estimation. The modulation type and order needs to be taken into account. Furthermore, the modulation order of the two data streams may also be different, e.g., QPSK may be used for one stream while 16QAM is used for the other. In this paper we describe the HSDPA transmitter and antenna weight matrix parameter calculations, as well as a chip level equalizer structure for which the BER is to be estimated. The transmit antenna weight matrix calculations are based on Channel State Information (CSI) and can be used, along with adaptive modulation and coding to optimize transmission. In the receiver a chip level 2 \u00d7 2 matrix Wiener equalizer is first used to recover the two transmit antenna streams in a minimum mean square error sense. The equalizer is implemented using a generalized overlap-save filtering method using FFT processing. Following this, the transmitter processing is reversed to estimate the transmitted data. The BER estimator must take into account white noise at the receiver, the interference between codes from loss of orthogonality due to the multipath channel, self noise from different time shifts of the given user's code (also due to the multipath channel) and the crosstalk between the user's two data streams, which use the same CDMA codes. The BER estimator for both the basic Wiener filter receiver and the Wiener filter plus interference canceller will be analyzed and compared with simulated BER measurements.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Long Island Systems, Applications and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5775772/5784200/05784244.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Long Island Systems, Applications and Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/LISAT.2011.5784244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LISAT.2011.5784244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784200","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER estimation for MIMO HSDPA : Chip level Wiener equalizer and successive interference cancellation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Receivers","Multiaccess communication","MIMO","Equalizers","Interference cancellation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","adaptive modulation","code division multiple access","equalisers","error statistics","fast Fourier transforms","interference suppression","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","transmitting antennas","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER estimation","CDMA MIMO HSDPA","chip level Wiener equalizer","successive interference cancellation","bit error rate estimator","interference canceller","high speed downlink packet access","Third Generation Partnership Project","3GPP","multiple orthogonal CDMA codes","signal constellations","QPSK","16QAM","HSDPA transmitter","antenna weight matrix parameter calculations","chip level equalizer structure","transmit antenna weight matrix calculations","channel state information","adaptive modulation","transmit antenna streams","mean square error sense","generalized overlap-save filtering method","FFT processing","multipath channel","Wiener filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784244/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-6 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"BER estimation for MIMO HSDPA : Chip level Wiener equalizer and successive interference cancellation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5784244/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12036500","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","conferenceDate":"6-6 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER estimation for MIMO HSDPA : Chip level Wiener equalizer and successive interference cancellation","confLoc":"Farmingdale, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"VoltzNC.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053596S","chronDate":"6-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5775772","isNumber":"5784200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5775772","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5784200","articleId":"5784244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5784284,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Bohemond","affiliation":["RESO Laboratory, \u00c9cole Nationale dIng\u00e9nieurs de Brest, European University of Brittany-UBS, Brest, France"],"bio":{"p":["Christian Boh\u00e9mond was born in Klayaa, Lebanon.

The design employs five transistors per-pixel to implement a charge-based \u03a3\u0394 ADC at each pixel. In the current design a dynamic regenerative latch comparator is divided into an input transistor, which is contained within each pixel, and the remaining comparator structure shared among the pixels of each column. A charge feedback digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is implemented at each pixel with a three-transistor structure. As opposed to more traditional CMOS image sensors, this image sensor architecture is suitable for implementations in advanced low supply voltage CMOS technologies since its dynamic range is not affected by the reduction of the pixel reset voltage. In addition, similar to the readout methods in low power random access memory designs, this pixel readout architecture does not employ any active amplifiers which allows for low static power operation. Experimental characterization of a prototype fabricated in a 0.35 \u03bcm silicided CMOS technology is presented. The estimated power consumption of the fully integrated 128 \u00d7 128 imager including decimation filters and I/O interface is 60 nW/pixel at 30 frames per second for 8-bits per-pixel. A peak signal-to-noise ratio of 52 dB and intra-scene dynamic range of 74 dB were measured.

Across a broad range of wavelength shifts, we observe a considerable increase (over 20 dB) in the conversion efficiency, and a corresponding increase in the optical SNR (over 12 dB), as the device current is increased from 100 to 500 mA. For input pump powers below 1 mW, gain recovery in our device is dominated by internal ASE. Higher pump power levels reduce the conversion efficiency because of the pump-induced gain saturation near the output end. We show that wavelength shifts of up to 25 nm are possible, while maintaining a >;10% conversion efficiency and a high optical SNR (>;25 dB). A major advantage of our scheme is that the use of relatively low pump powers (<; 1 mW) reduces the electrical power consumption for such wavelength converters by more than a factor of 10. We discuss in detail the issue of optimum pump and signal powers.

Low-level time-frequency representations such as the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) are popular, because they offer a meaningful insight on sound properties for a low computational cost. Conversely, when higher level semantics, such as pitch, timbre or phoneme, are sought after, representations usually tend to enhance their discriminative characteristics, at the expense of their invertibility. They become so-called mid-level representations. In this paper, a source/filter signal model which provides a mid-level representation is proposed. This representation makes the pitch content of the signal as well as some timbre information available, hence keeping as much information from the raw data as possible. This model is successfully used within a main melody extraction system and a lead instrument/accompaniment separation system. Both frameworks obtained top results at several international evaluation campaigns.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Musically Motivated Mid-Level Representation for Pitch Estimation and Musical Audio Source Separation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2158801","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6018327/05784290.pdf","startPage":"1180","endPage":"1191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2158801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6018327","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784290/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Musically Motivated Mid-Level Representation for Pitch Estimation and Musical Audio Source Separation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5784290/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12228468","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Musically Motivated Mid-Level Representation for Pitch Estimation and Musical Audio Source Separation","sourcePdf":"jstsp-durrieu-2158801-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154995S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6018327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6018327","articleId":"5784290","onlineDate":"07 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5784300,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoke Yi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering Institute of Photonics and Optical Science, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiaoke","lastName":"Yi","id":"37557315700"},{"name":"Thomas X.

Unfortunately, for such a kind of synthesis problems, local optimization procedures may be ineffective, whereas global optimization procedures involve a severe computational effort. To circumvent these problems, a new deterministic approach for fast design of aperiodic concentric ring arrays is proposed. The method exploits easily obtained optimal continuous planar solutions, accounts for the geometric properties of the array element and allows, once the central geometry of the array (that is, at least the most internal ring) is fixed, to compute in a deterministic, iterative, very fast way the whole geometry of the density-tapered concentric ring array. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the method, which provides in a few seconds layouts of hundreds of elements able to produce directivity patterns that satisfy realistic satellite project requirements.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2158783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5970251/05784315.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2158783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970251","startPage":"2852","endPage":"2861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deterministic Two Dimensional Density Taper Approach for Fast Design of Uniform Amplitude Pencil Beams Arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784315","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Deterministic Two Dimensional Density Taper Approach for Fast Design of Uniform Amplitude Pencil Beams Arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784315/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205155","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5784315/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deterministic Two Dimensional Density Taper Approach for Fast Design of Uniform Amplitude Pencil Beams Arrays","sourcePdf":"tap-perna-2158783-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107847S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5970251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5970251","articleId":"5784315","onlineDate":"07 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5784319,"authors":[{"name":"Wenji Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenji","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37597069000"},{"name":"Lian Li","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lian","lastName":"Li","id":"37067768900"},{"name":"Fang Li","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Li","id":"37289387400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5784319","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2133},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna radiation patterns","Optimization","Linear antenna arrays","Planar arrays","Bayesian methods","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","linear antenna arrays","planar antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear antenna arrays","planar antenna arrays","sparseness constrained optimization","sparse antenna arrays","antenna array synthesis problem","Bayesian compressive sensing","antenna radiation pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear array","planar array","sparse antenna array synthesis","sparseness constrained optimization"]}],"abstract":"The synthesis of sparse antenna arrays has many practical applications in situations where the weight, size and cost of antennas are limited.

The transmitter, the legitimate receiver, and the eavesdropper are connected by a discrete memoryless wiretap channel with a memoryless state sequence. The transmitter and the legitimate receiver generate a secret-key that must be concealed from the eavesdropper. We assume that the state sequence is known noncausally to the transmitter and no public discussion channel is available. We derive lower and upper bounds on the secret-key capacity. The lower bound involves a source-channel codebook for constructing a common reconstruction sequence at the legitimate terminals and then mapping this sequence to a secret-key using a secret-key codebook. For the special case of Gaussian channels with additive interference (secret-keys from dirty paper channel) our bounds differ by 0.5 bit/symbol and coincide in the high signal-to-noise-ratio and high interference-to-noise-ratio regimes. In another special case-symmetric channel state information (CSI)-when the legitimate receiver is also revealed the state sequence, we establish optimality of our lower bound. In addition, only causal side information at the transmitter and the receiver suffices to attain the secret-key capacity in the case of symmetric CSI.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2011.2151188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983315","startPage":"672","endPage":"681","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5983315/05784328.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2151188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secret-Key Agreement With Channel State Information at the Transmitter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Transmitters","Fading","Encoding","Electronic mail","Random variables","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel coding","Gaussian channels","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","source coding","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secret-key agreement capacity","discrete memoryless wiretap channel","memoryless state sequence","state sequence","public discussion channel","source channel codebook","common reconstruction sequence","secret-key codebook","Gaussian channel","additive interference","signal-to-noise-ratio","interference-to-noise-ratio","case symmetric channel state information","causal side information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel reciprocity","channels with state parameters","fading channels","information-theoretic security","secret-key generation","secret sharing","wireless channels","wire-tap channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Secret-Key Agreement With Channel State Information at the Transmitter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784328/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5784328/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12205664","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secret-Key Agreement With Channel State Information at the Transmitter","sourcePdf":"tifs-khisti-2151188-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091778S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5983315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5983315","articleId":"5784328","onlineDate":"07 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5784330,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Hosman","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6064350/5784330/5784330-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Hosman received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering, in 2009, from the University of Oklahoma, Norman, where he is currently working toward the M.S. degree in electrical engineering with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.","He plans to pursue a career in the industry as a hardware design engineer after graduation.

However, traditional radio frequency (RF) communication schemes are not capable of transmitting signals through metal enclosures. As an alternative to RF, an ultrasonic communication system based on multitone frequency-shift keying (MFSK) has been developed and evaluated using the steel corner posts of shipping containers as the communication medium. Empirical studies have been performed on the steel channel. The communication system is configurable and consists of two or more modules. The modules are mounted to the metal posts and utilize an inexpensive ultrasonic transducer to send and receive modulated signals through the metal channel. A module also makes use of an inexpensive digital-signal-processing chip for modulating and demodulating MFSK signals. Two case studies for the shipping container application were evaluated: 1) communicating through one container and 2) communicating between stacked containers. Regarding the second case study, a key discovery was that each of the aggregate steel columns formed by a stack of shipping containers can serve as an ultrasonic communication channel that spans all containers in the stack.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Containers","Acoustics","Ultrasonic transducers","Steel","Receivers","Frequency shift keying","Communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic receivers","demodulation","digital signal processing chips","frequency shift keying","steel","telecommunication channels","transmitters","ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmitter-receiver","ultrasonic communication system","metallic structures","wireless transmission","closed shipping container","radiofrequency communication schemes","multitone frequency-shift keying","communication medium","steel channel","inexpensive ultrasonic transducer","metal channel","digital-signal-processing chip","MFSK signal modulation","signal demodulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel characterization","multitone frequency-shift keying (MFSK)","shipping containers","ultrasonic communication"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2149270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6064350/05784330.pdf","startPage":"3767","endPage":"3774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2149270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Characterization of an MFSK-Based Transmitter/Receiver for Ultrasonic Communication Through Metallic Structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Characterization of an MFSK-Based Transmitter/Receiver for Ultrasonic Communication Through Metallic Structures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784330/","volume":"60","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5784330/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12331225","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Characterization of an MFSK-Based Transmitter/Receiver for Ultrasonic Communication Through Metallic Structures","sourcePdf":"tim-yeary-2149270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059224S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6064350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6064350","articleId":"5784330","onlineDate":"07 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5784337,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Gripon","affiliation":["Electronics Department, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne (Institut T\u00e9l\u00e9com), Brest, France","Laboratory for Science and Technologies of Information, Communication and Knowledge, Lab-STICC, CNRS, Brest, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5937482/5784337/5784337-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vincent Gripon (S'10) received the M.S. degree from the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, Rennes, France, specializing in mathematics and computer science.

The approach splits the control architecture into two separate layers. The hierarchical top layer is used to implement a strategy that addresses the desired transparency, and the lower layer ensures that no \u201cvirtual\u201d energy is generated. This means that any bilateral controller can be implemented in a passive manner. Separate communication channels connect the layers at the slave and master sides so that information related to exchanged energy is completely separated from information about the desired behavior. Furthermore, the proposed implementation does not depend on any type of assumption about the time delay in the communication channel. By complete separation of the properties of passivity and transparency, each layer can accommodate any number of different implementations that allow for almost independent optimization. Experimental results are presented, which highlight the benefit of the proposed framework.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2011.2142430","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/5975532/05784345.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2011.2142430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975532","startPage":"741","endPage":"756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bilateral Telemanipulation With Time Delays: A Two-Layer Approach Combining Passivity and Transparency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bilateral Telemanipulation With Time Delays: A Two-Layer Approach Combining Passivity and Transparency","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205424","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5784345/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bilateral Telemanipulation With Time Delays: A Two-Layer Approach Combining Passivity and Transparency","sourcePdf":"tro-franken-2142430-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073865S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"5975532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"180","xplore-issue":"5975532","articleId":"5784345","onlineDate":"07 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5784348,"authors":[{"name":"Ludo C.

To achieve this, variable stiffness actuators consist of a number of elastic elements and a number of actuated degrees of freedom, which determine how the elastic elements are perceived at the actuator output. Changing the apparent output stiffness is useful for a broad range of applications, which explains the increasing research interest in this class of actuators. In this paper, a generic, port-based model for variable stiffness actuators is presented, with which a wide variety of designs can be modeled and analyzed. From the analysis of the model, it is possible to derive kinematic properties that variable stiffness actuator designs should satisfy in order to be energy efficient. More specifically, the kinematics should be such that the apparent output stiffness can be varied without changing the potential energy that is stored in the internal elastic elements. A concept design of an energy-efficient variable stiffness actuator is presented and implemented. Simulations of the model and experiments on the realized prototype validate the design principle.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2011.2150430","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/6032150/05784348.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2011.2150430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6032150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","startPage":"865","endPage":"875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Variable Stiffness Actuators","volume":"27","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5784348/","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12270708","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Variable Stiffness Actuators","sourcePdf":"tro-visser-2150430-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071989S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6032150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"6032150","articleId":"5784348","onlineDate":"07 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5784350,"authors":[{"name":"Kuang-Yu Sung","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6017249/5784350/5784350-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuang-Yu Sung (S'05) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1980.

Consider a network that consists of multiple cooperative pairs that employ a two-phase cooperation scheme, where the users first transmit their own messages on each of their subcarriers in phase I and either retransmit their own messages or relay the messages of their partners in phase II. In general, subcarrier allocation and partner selection problems are known to be intractable for systems with large number of users and subcarriers. In this paper, we propose a suboptimal but mathematically tractable approach to address these issues and show its effectiveness compared with existing algorithms. This approach is done by considering the power allocation over a relaxed problem formulation, where each subcarrier is allowed to retransmit or relay for all other subcarriers in phase II over virtually orthogonal channels. The power allocation in this case is a convex optimization problem and, thus, can efficiently be solved. Based on the results of the relaxed power allocation problem, an efficient subcarrier allocation algorithm for the original problem can then be derived by allowing subcarriers to forward the data that are allocated the most power. The results also yield a necessary and sufficient condition on when cooperation is helpful among two users. A partner selection algorithm is then devised based on the criterion given in the condition. With the proposed subcarrier allocation scheme, an iterative procedure is then adopted for resource allocation in the two phases. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is discussed, and its efficacy is demonstrated through numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2158867","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6017249/05784350.pdf","startPage":"3228","endPage":"3240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2158867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation and Partner Selection for Cooperative Multicarrier Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784350/","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation and Partner Selection for Cooperative Multicarrier Systems","volume":"60","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12219094","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5784350/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation and Partner Selection for Cooperative Multicarrier Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-hong-2158867-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083696S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6017249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6017249","articleId":"5784350","onlineDate":"07 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5784354,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Ming Zhang","affiliation":["NationalMobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China","School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6017249/5784354/5784354-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xin Ming Zhang (M'08) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical engineering from the China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China, in 1985 and 1988, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2001.","Since 2002, he has been with the faculty of the University of Science and Technology of China, where he is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Computer Science and Technology.

This feature leads to frequent path failures and route reconstructions, which causes an increase in the routing control overhead. Thus, it is imperative to reduce the overhead of route discovery in the design of routing protocols of MANETs. In this paper, we propose an estimated distance (EstD)-based routing protocol (EDRP) to steer a route discovery in the general direction of a destination, which can restrict the propagation range of route request (RREQ) and reduce the routing overhead. In the EDRP, the change regularity of the received signal strength (RSS) is exploited to estimate the geometrical distance between a pair of nodes, which is called the estimated geometrical distance (EGD). Simulation experiments based on a random waypoint (RWP) model show that the EGD can effectively reflect the actual distance when it is less than the expected value of the distance [which is called the estimation radius (E-Radius)] between any node pairs. We also propose an estimated topological distance (ETD), which is a topology-based EstD, as an aid to the EGD, which can mitigate the effect of inaccurate EGD. The EstD is a combination of EGD and ETD. In the protocol, every node evaluates the link quality through the computational process of the EGD to eliminate the weak links and then uses the EstD (EGD and ETD) to steer the RREQ packets toward the general direction of the destination. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol can significantly reduce the routing overhead and improve the routing performance in dense or high-mobility networks.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2158865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2158865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6017249/05784354.pdf","startPage":"3473","endPage":"3484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Estimated Distance-Based Routing Protocol for Mobile Ad hoc Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"An Estimated Distance-Based Routing Protocol for Mobile Ad hoc Networks","volume":"60","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5784354/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12219097","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784354/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Estimated Distance-Based Routing Protocol for Mobile Ad hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2158865-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114203S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6017249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6017249","articleId":"5784354","onlineDate":"07 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5784355,"authors":[{"name":"William.

We use theoretical model and experiments to demonstrate that the sign for stress induced leakage current (SILC) reverses as PBTI transitions from trapping to trap generation dominated regimes; this is in contrast to threshold voltage shift with no corresponding sign reversal. SILC crossover methodology further verifies that initial and fast saturated trapping is temperature independent while trap generation is voltage and temperature activated. The SILC-based reassignment not only indentifies trapping and trap generation regimes of PBTI, but also suggests a remarkable universality of trap generation in wide variety of High-k samples.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2011.5784476","publicationTitle":"2011 International Reliability Physics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5776767/5784429/05784476.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2011.5784476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784429","startPage":"3A.3.1","endPage":"3A.3.6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SILC-based reassignment of trapping and trap generation regimes of positive bias temperature instability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SILC-based reassignment of trapping and trap generation regimes of positive bias temperature instability","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784476/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12047451","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5784476/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SILC-based reassignment of trapping and trap generation regimes of positive bias temperature instability","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3a03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050838S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5776767","isNumber":"5784429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5776767","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5784429","articleId":"5784476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5784484,"authors":[{"name":"Brian D.

One is the piezoresistivity effect induced by the near surface stresses on the charge mobility for p- and n- channel MOSFET devices. The other problem concerns the interfacial delamination induced by thermal stresses including the pop-up mechanism of TSV with a `nail head'. We first analyze the three-dimensional distribution of the thermal stresses near the TSV and the wafer surface. The stress characteristics are inherently 3D in nature with the near-surface stress distributions distinctly different from the 2D solution. The energy release rate for interfacial delamination of TSV is evaluated under both cooling and heating conditions, using an analytical solution for a steady-state crack growth as an upper bound and numerical solutions by finite element analysis (FEA) for more detailed calculations. Based on these results, we examine the piezoresistivity effect induced by the near surface stresses on the charge mobility for p-and n- channel MOSFET devices, including the study of the effect of TSV scaling on the keep-out zone for MOSFET devices. This is followed by analyzing the energy release rate for interfacial delamination for a fully filled TSV and the potential mechanisms for TSV pop-up due to interfacial fracture.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5776767/5784429/05784487.pdf","startPage":"3D.1.1","endPage":"3D.1.7","publicationTitle":"2011 International Reliability Physics Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2011.5784487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2011.5784487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermomechanical reliability of through-silicon vias in 3D interconnects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","Through-silicon vias","Silicon","MOSFET circuits","Delamination","Thermal loading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delamination","finite element analysis","fracture","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit reliability","MOSFET","piezoelectricity","surface cracks","thermal stresses","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermomechanical reliability","through-silicon vias","3D interconnects","piezoresistivity effect","charge mobility","n- channel MOSFET devices","n-channel MOSFET devices","p-channel MOSFET devices","interfacial delamination","thermal stresses","three-dimensional distribution","wafer surface","near-surface stress distributions","energy release rate","cooling","steady-state crack growth","upper bound","finite element analysis","TSV scaling effect","interfacial fracture","nail head"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D interconnect","TSV","Thermo-mechanical reliability","FEA","Crack driving force"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Thermomechanical reliability of through-silicon vias in 3D interconnects","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5784487/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12047461","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermomechanical reliability of through-silicon vias in 3D interconnects","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3d01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090119S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5776767","isNumber":"5784429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5776767","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5784429","articleId":"5784487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5784499,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Design of reliable circuits with unreliable components has been a challenge since the early days of electro-mechanical switches and have been addressed by elegant coding and redundancy techniques. And radiation hard design principles have been used extensively for systems affected by soft transient errors. Additional modern reliability concerns associated with parametric degradation of NBTI and soft-broken gate dielectrics and proliferation of memory and thin-film technologies add new dimension to reliability-aware design. Taken together, these device, circuit, architectural, and software based fault-tolerant approaches have enabled continued scaling of integrated circuits and is likely to be a part of any reliability qualification protocol for future technology generations.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2011.5784500","publicationTitle":"2011 International Reliability Physics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5776767/5784429/05784500.pdf","startPage":"4A.1.1","endPage":"4A.1.11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2011.5784500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability- and Process-variation aware design of integrated circuits \u2014 A broader perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reliability- and Process-variation aware design of integrated circuits \u2014 A broader perspective","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12047474","publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5784500/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784500/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2011","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability- and Process-variation aware design of integrated circuits \u2014 A broader perspective","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4a01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.142041S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5776767","isNumber":"5784429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5776767","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5784429","articleId":"5784500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5784501,"authors":[{"name":"M.

First, Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) measurements are used to show that the capture/emission processes of individual defects in highly scaled HKMG FETs exhibit very similar Poisson statistics and can be fully characterized by a characteristic electron/hole capture, \u03c4\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</sub>\n, and emission time, \u03c4\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e</sub>\n, in NFET/PFET. In all cases, capture and emission are found to be thermally activated. These observations suggest that NBTI and PBTI share similar microscopic trapping/de-trapping mechanism, for holes and electrons, respectively. Based on these findings, a simple physical model is introduced which describes the behavior of a distribution of identical defects (characterized by \u03c4\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</sub>\n and \u03c4\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e</sub>\n) but provides deep insights into the BTI dynamics under AC stress in general. The occupancy level of identical defects at equilibrium is found to becomes frequency, f, independent for f \u226b [1/\u03c4\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</sub>\n, 1/\u03c4\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e</sub>\n], such that the BTI behavior at operation conditions (~GHz) can be measured at relatively low frequencies (in the kHz range). The single defect model was then expanded to predict the macroscopic BTI behaviors in NMOS devices for arbitrary stress conditions. Excellent agreement between model prediction and experimental data is demonstrated, confirming that PBTI in HKMG gate stacks can be understood as a superposition of trapping/de-trapping events from individual defects in the gate stack. The overall dynamics of PBTI is thus largely governed by the distribution of electron capture and emission times of the defects in the gate stack. The challenges for using a capture and emission time based model for product lifetime predictions are addressed.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2011.5784502","publicationTitle":"2011 International Reliability Physics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5776767/5784429/05784502.pdf","startPage":"4A.3.1","endPage":"4A.3.9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2011.5784502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PBTI under dynamic stress: From a single defect point of view","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784502/","displayDocTitle":"PBTI under dynamic stress: From a single defect point of view","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12047476","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5784502/","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PBTI under dynamic stress: From a single defect point of view","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4a03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125861S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5776767","isNumber":"5784429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5776767","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5784429","articleId":"5784502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5784503,"authors":[{"name":"Kenichi Abe","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Abe","id":"37277544900"},{"name":"Akinobu Teramoto","affiliation":["New Industry Creation Hatchery Center, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Akinobu","lastName":"Teramoto","id":"37294741800"},{"name":"Shigetoshi Sugawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigetoshi","lastName":"Sugawa","id":"37284703100"},{"name":"Tadahiro Ohmi","affiliation":["World Premier International Research Center, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadahiro","lastName":"Ohmi","id":"37267281400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9112-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9113-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9111-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1891"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1541-7026"},{"format":"CD","value":"1541-7026"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1541-7026"}],"articleNumber":"5784503","dbTime":"64 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":990},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["FETs","MOSFET circuits","Logic gates","Electron traps","Histograms","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electron traps","hole traps","MOSFET","semiconductor device noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traps","random telegraph noise","time constants","noise amplitude","MOSFET"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["random telegraph noise","trap","time constant","energy distribution"]}],"abstract":"We develop a high-speed method to extract time constants and noise amplitude of random telegraph noise (RTN).

The results are based on Oracle's (formerly Sun Microsystems) neutron beam testing over the past several years. We describe how the tests were conducted and how the test results are used to influence microprocessor design. As microprocessor feature sizes decreased from 180nm to 65nm, memory error rates per bit decreased, but our data indicates a reversal of this trend at 40nm. Flop error rates still appear to be decreasing, even at a 28nm feature size We measure SER as a function of power supply voltage (Vdd) over a range of 1.2V down to 0.5V, and the data shows SER significantly increases as Vdd decreases. This result implies that dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS), a commonly used microprocessor energy reduction technique, could cause a significant decrease in microprocessor reliability. The data also show that more energy-efficient transistors using back bias technique do not appear to significantly impact microprocessor reliability.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2011.5784522","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5776767/5784429/05784522.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2011.5784522","publicationTitle":"2011 International Reliability Physics Symposium","startPage":"5B.4.1","endPage":"5B.4.7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impact of new technology on soft error rates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"The impact of new technology on soft error rates","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784522/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5784522/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12047496","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of new technology on soft error rates","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"5b04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076255S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5776767","isNumber":"5784429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5776767","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"5784429","articleId":"5784522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5784542,"authors":[{"name":"Hans Reisinger","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Hans","lastName":"Reisinger","id":"37275398500"},{"name":"Tibor Grasser","affiliation":["Institute for Microelectronics, Technical University of of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Tibor","lastName":"Grasser","id":"37282995100"},{"name":"Karsten Ermisch","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Karsten","lastName":"Ermisch","id":"37547102500"},{"name":"Heiko Nielen","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Heiko","lastName":"Nielen","id":"38053794400"},{"name":"Wolfgang Gustin","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Gustin","id":"37547102900"},{"name":"Christian Schl\u00fcnder","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schl\u00fcnder","id":"37374677400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9112-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9113-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9111-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1891"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1541-7026"},{"format":"CD","value":"1541-7026"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1541-7026"}],"articleNumber":"5784542","dbTime":"109 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1054},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","Delay","Frequency measurement","Frequency dependence","Degradation","Filling","Stress measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field effect transistors","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC NBTI","negative bias temperature instability","oxide border traps","emission time constants","AC stress","recovery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC-stress","NBTI","recovery"]}],"abstract":"We present a model for AC NBTI which is based on capture and emission of charges in and out of oxide border traps.

NAND flash memory. The negative Vt shift occurs on an inhibited cell adjacent to a cell being programmed in the WL direction. The magnitude of the shift becomes larger when the programming voltage (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Pgm</sub>\n) is higher, thinner field oxide and slower program speed of the adjacent cell. The mechanism of negative Vt shift is attributed to hot holes that are generated by FN electrons, injected from channel / junction to the control gate (CG) along the isolation. This phenomenon will become worse with scaling since hot hole generation is increased by increasing electron injection due to narrower FG space. Therefore, this negative Vt shift phenomenon is one of the new NAND flash memory cell scaling limiter, that needs to be managed for 2bits and 3bits/cell in 2X nm and beyond.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2011.5784548","publicationTitle":"2011 International Reliability Physics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5776767/5784429/05784548.pdf","startPage":"6B.2.1","endPage":"6B.2.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2011.5784548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel negative Vt shift program disturb phenomena in 2X\u223c3X nm NAND flash memory cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784548/","displayDocTitle":"Novel negative Vt shift program disturb phenomena in 2X\u223c3X nm NAND flash memory cells","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5784548/","publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2011","accessionNumber":"12047519","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel negative Vt shift program disturb phenomena in 2X\u223c3X nm NAND flash memory cells","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"6b02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087009S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5776767","isNumber":"5784429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5776767","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5784429","articleId":"5784548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5784549,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A lighter junction dosage gets better sub-threshold swing (SS) and helps the shrinkage of device channel length. However, some drawbacks, such as worse current fluctuation and abnormal self-boosting (SB), can be observed as the side effects. Charge pumping technique is applied to identify their impact, and then, the noise contribution along the channel can be portrayed by random telegraph noise (RTN) profiling. Second, program/erase (P/E) cycling effect is examined. The degradations of cell performance due to stress-induced oxide charges near gate edges are studied. The correlation between SB behavior and junction profile is established. Contrary to conventional global SB (GSB), the local SB (LSB) is more effective in sustaining sufficient channel potential, which enhances local junction or band-to-band field with modest tunneling induced disturbance. It is observed that an abnormal hot carrier injection results in the tail feature at the upper half of erased-V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</sub>\n distribution.

An AC BTI model is developed that accurately captures the critical BTI relaxation effect through the DC stress/relax predictions on duty cycle dependence.

Excellent agreement is demonstrated between the frequency degradation measurements obtained with a newly developed Ultra-Fast On-The-Fly (OTF) measurement technique optimized for BTI and the AC BTI model based RO simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784559/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12047530","publicationDate":"April 2011","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5784559/","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A robust reliability methodology for accurately predicting Bias Temperature Instability induced circuit performance degradation in HKMG CMOS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust reliability methodology for accurately predicting Bias Temperature Instability induced circuit performance degradation in HKMG CMOS","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"cr01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063211S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5776767","isNumber":"5784429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5776767","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5784429","articleId":"5784559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5784572,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The reliability of the 7T/14T SRAM can be dynamically changed by a control signal depending on an operating condition and application. The 14T dependable mode allocates one bit in a 14T cell and improves the BER in a read operation and SER in a retention state, simultaneously. We investigate its error rate mitigating mechanisms using Synopsys TCAD simulator. In our measurements, the minimum operating voltage was improved by 100 mV, the alpha-induced SER was suppressed by 80.0%, and the neutron-induced SER was decreased by 34.4% in the 14T dependable mode over the 7T normal mode.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2011.5784596","publicationTitle":"2011 International Reliability Physics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5776767/5784429/05784596.pdf","startPage":"SE.3.1","endPage":"SE.3.6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2011.5784596","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit error and soft error hardenable 7T/14T SRAM with 150-nm FD-SOI process","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Bit error and soft error hardenable 7T/14T SRAM with 150-nm FD-SOI process","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12047567","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5784596/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit error and soft error hardenable 7T/14T SRAM with 150-nm FD-SOI process","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"se03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086362S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5776767","isNumber":"5784429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5776767","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5784429","articleId":"5784596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5784597,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Simulation results demonstrate that in the presence of faults, the saturated throughput of the FoN switch is 13% higher on average than a cost-based deflection switch for 8\u00d78 mesh. The average hop counts can be up to 1.7\u00d7 less than the cost-based switch. The FoN switch is also synthesized using 65nm TSMC technology and it can work at 500MHz with small area overhead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FoN: Fault-on-Neighbor aware routing algorithm for Networks-on-Chip","publicationTitle":"23rd IEEE International SOC Conference","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2010.5784672","displayPublicationTitle":"23rd IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5755492/5784634/05784672.pdf","startPage":"441","endPage":"446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2010.5784672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"FoN: Fault-on-Neighbor aware routing algorithm for Networks-on-Chip","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5784672/","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"12047342","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FoN: Fault-on-Neighbor aware routing algorithm for Networks-on-Chip","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"WA23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117828S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5755492","isNumber":"5784634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5755492","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5784634","articleId":"5784672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5784673,"authors":[{"name":"Ankit More","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Ankit More","id":"37403964400"},{"name":"Baris Taskin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Baris Taskin","id":"37265611900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6683-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6681-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-1676"}],"articleNumber":"5784673","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":554},"abstract":"The feasibility of using on-chip antennas for a reconfigurable 3D wireless network-on-chip (3D-WiNoC) on a 3D integrated circuit (IC) is shown. The reconfigurable 3D-WiNoC is designed with on-chip antennas which are proposed to be used in conjunction with the metal interconnects making it a hybrid design. The feasibility of the on-chip antennas is shown by performing a 3-D finite element method (FEM) based full wave electro-magnetic analysis on a 3D IC model. The 3D IC is modeled according to a complimentary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) silicon on insulator (SoI) Benzocyclobutene (BCB) polymer adhesive bonding 3-D circuit integration technology. It is shown that it is possible to have two different frequency domains for the signal sources and the dynamic switching of the signal sinks between the two frequency domains, with minimal design and area overhead. When implemented, the proposed hybrid network architecture with two frequency channels can reduce the latency and increase the network throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"23rd IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5755492/5784634/05784673.pdf","startPage":"447","endPage":"452","publicationTitle":"23rd IEEE International SOC Conference","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2010.5784673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2010.5784673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation based study of on-chip antennas for a reconfigurable hybrid 3D wireless NoC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Silicon","Epitaxial growth","Conductivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","CMOS integrated circuits","finite element analysis","network-on-chip","silicon-on-insulator","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-chip antenna","reconfigurable hybrid 3D wireless NoC","wireless network-on-chip","3D-WiNoC","3D integrated circuit","metal interconnects","finite element method","FEM","full wave electro-magnetic analysis","3D IC","complimentary metal oxide semiconductor","CMOS","silicon-on-insulator","SOI","benzocyclobutene","BCB polymer adhesive bonding","3D circuit integration technology","dynamic switching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Simulation based study of on-chip antennas for a reconfigurable hybrid 3D wireless NoC","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5784673/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"12047343","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation based study of on-chip antennas for a reconfigurable hybrid 3D wireless NoC","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"WA24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086933S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5755492","isNumber":"5784634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5755492","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5784634","articleId":"5784673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5784678,"authors":[{"name":"Bai Na","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, South East University, Japan"],"firstName":"Bai","lastName":"Na","id":"38070785000"},{"name":"Xuan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Xuan Chen","id":"38065150100"},{"name":"Yang Jun","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, South East University, Japan"],"lastName":"Yang Jun","id":"37415412400"},{"name":"Shi Longxin","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, South East University, Japan"],"lastName":"Shi Longxin","id":"38071999900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6683-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6681-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-1676"}],"articleNumber":"5784678","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A differential read subthreshold SRAM bitcell with self-adaptive leakage cut off scheme","displayPublicationTitle":"23rd IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5755492/5784634/05784678.pdf","startPage":"455","endPage":"460","publicationTitle":"23rd IEEE International SOC Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2010.5784678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784634","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2010.5784678","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Transistors","Leakage current","Stability analysis","Energy dissipation","Transient analysis","Current distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer circuits","leakage currents","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential read subthreshold SRAM bitcell","self-adaptive leakage cut off scheme","buffering circuit","dynamic energy dissipation","performance penalty"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784678","abstract":"Leakage energy increases dramatically in subthreshold region because delay increases exponentially with decreasing supply voltage.

Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistor (CNTFET) is a very promising and superior technology for its applications to circuit design. In this paper we intend to evaluate and compare the performance parameters of a traditional 6T SRAM cell between a predictive 16nm Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology and CNTFET. The model used to simulate CNT transistor is a tentative model from the researchers of Stanford University, which is not yet practically implemented. Since the dimensions of MOSFETS are reduced aggressively, it is essential to know the potential of what both the technologies have to offer, with their least dimensions available. The SRAM design uses the smallest transistors possible and is also susceptible to reliability issues and process variations, making it an ideal benchmark circuit to compare the two technologies. Our simulations results show that CNTFET based SRAM design is a viable design to choose compared to its CMOS counterpart. The results show that there is a 52.7% increase in SNM of the memory cell. Meanwhile, the cell becomes 5% faster. These results clearly justify that CNTFET is more suitable for circuit design rather than MOSFETs, although both the models under consideration are predictive models. This comparative study would definitely help us choose better technology alternatives in near future.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"12047359","htmlLink":"/document/5784690/","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison of performance parameters of SRAM designs in 16nm CMOS and CNTFET technologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of performance parameters of SRAM designs in 16nm CMOS and CNTFET technologies","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"P15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033453S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5755492","isNumber":"5784634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5755492","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5784634","articleId":"5784690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5784692,"authors":[{"name":"Weifeng He","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Weifeng","lastName":"He","id":"37417306000"},{"name":"Weiwei Chen","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Weiwei","lastName":"Chen","id":"38065814100"},{"name":"Zhigang Mao","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Mao","id":"37287023100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6683-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6681-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-1676"}],"articleNumber":"5784692","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Arrays","Very large scale integration","Video coding","Pixel","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","video coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architecture","enlarged block sizes","high-performance video coding standard","full-search extended variable block sizes motion estimation","adopting macroblock SAD partition","partial SAD values reuse scheme","PE numbers","current architectures","PE utilization","next generation HVC standard"]}],"abstract":"Video Coding using enlarged block sizes is one of the major technologies for the current developing High-performance Video Coding standard.

In consequence, this new architecture offers a feasible solution to next generation HVC standard.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient VLSI architecture for extended variable block sizes motion estimation","publicationTitle":"23rd IEEE International SOC Conference","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2010.5784692","displayPublicationTitle":"23rd IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5755492/5784634/05784692.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2010.5784692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5784692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5784692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An efficient VLSI architecture for extended variable block sizes motion estimation","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5784692/","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"12047361","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient VLSI architecture for extended variable block sizes motion estimation","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"P17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040767S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5755492","isNumber":"5784634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5755492","xplore-issue":"5784634","articleId":"5784692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5784729,"authors":[{"name":"Soonwoo Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Soonwoo","lastName":"Choi","id":"37538244200"},{"name":"Jason J.K.
