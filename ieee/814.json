As a solution, this paper presents two alternative methods, namely Dependent Dual Space Reduction and Independent Dual Space Reduction, to reduce dimensions in the dual spaces, i.e. the feature and label spaces, using singular value decomposition (SVD). The first approach constructs the cross-covariance matrix to represent dependency between the features and labels, projects both of them into a single reduced space, and then performs prediction on the reduced space. On the other hand, the second approach handles the feature space and the label space separately by constructing a covariance matrix for each space to represent feature dependency and label dependency before performing SVD on dependency profile of each space to reduce dimension and for noise elimination and then predicting classes using their reduced dimensions. A number of experiments show that prediction on the reduced spaces for both dependent and independent reduction approaches can obtain better classification accuracy as well as faster computation, compared with the prediction using the original spaces. Finally, the results of our methods are also compared with the prediction using other types of dimensionality reduction, with consideration of the factors of covariance and threshold selection.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8140362","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8140362/08140368.pdf","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxs169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxs169","startPage":"1113","endPage":"1135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Label Classification Using Dependent and Independent Dual Space Reduction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8140368/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Label Classification Using Dependent and Independent Dual Space Reduction","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Label Classification Using Dependent and Independent Dual Space Reduction","sourcePdf":"bxs169.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02486S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","isNumber":"8140362","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","citationCount":"4","articleId":"8140368","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8140839,"authors":[{"name":"Surya Nepal","firstName":"Surya","lastName":"Nepal"},{"name":"Suraj Pandey","firstName":"Suraj","lastName":"Pandey"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0010-4620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1460-2067"}],"articleNumber":"8140839","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxv004","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8140838/08140839.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxv004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8140838","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8140839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guest Editorial: Cloud Computing and Scientific Applications (CCSA)\u2014Big Data Analysis in the Cloud","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8140839/","displayDocTitle":"Guest Editorial: Cloud Computing and Scientific Applications (CCSA)\u2014Big Data Analysis in the Cloud","volume":"59","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guest Editorial: Cloud Computing and Scientific Applications (CCSA)\u2014Big Data Analysis in the Cloud","sourcePdf":"bxv004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021126S","chronDate":"March  2016","isNumber":"8140838","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8140839","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8140983,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This may lead to serious errors in computed MT transfer functions and result in erroneous interpretation. A substantial improvement is possible when the time-series are presented as clean as possible for further processing. Cleaning of MT time-series is often done by manual editing. Editing of magnetotelluric time-series is subjective in nature and time consuming. Automation of such a process is difficult to achieve by statistical methods. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are widely used to automate processes that require human intelligence. The objective here is to automate MT long-period time-series editing using ANN. A three-layer feed-forward artificial neural network (FANN) was adopted for the problem. As ANN-based techniques are computationally intensive, a novel approach was made, which involves editing of five simultaneously measured MT time-series that have been subdivided into stacks (a stack = 5 \u00d7 256 data points). Neural network training was done at two levels. Signal and noise patterns of individual channels were taught first. Five channel parameters along with interchannel correlation and amplitude ratios formed the input for a final network, which predicts the quality of a stack. A large database (5000 traces for pattern training and 900 vectors for interchannel training) was prepared to train the network. There were two error parameters to minimize while training: training error and testing error. Training was stopped when both errors were below an acceptable level. The sensitivity of the neural network to the signal-to-noise ratio and the relative significance of its inputs were tested to ensure that the training was correct. MT time-series from four stations with varying degrees of noise contamination were used to demonstrate the application of the network. The application brought out the ability of the network to pick out signals even in a high-noise environment. This suggest the possibility of automating the editing of MT time-series with artificial neural networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8140983/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2003","isJournal":true,"volume":"153","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2003","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The application of artificial neural networks to magnetotelluric time-series analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of artificial neural networks to magnetotelluric time-series analysis","sourcePdf":"1532409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030442S","chronDate":"May  2003","isNumber":"8140974","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8140983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-08-31"},{"_id":8141416,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117583"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8338166/8141416/yang-2779828-small.gif","p":["Lu Yang (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received the B.S. degree in\n information engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2007, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the\n School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, in 2010\n and 2015, respectively.

By utilizing the advanced lens antenna arrays, a mmWave lens multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system significantly reduces the number of radio-frequency (RF) chains required, and thus, achieves cost-effective implementation. In this paper, we propose a novel channel estimation scheme for the mmWave lens MIMO system with limited RF chains. The proposed scheme is applicable for the general mmWave MIMO communications, regardless of narrow-band or wide-band, time-division-duplexing or frequency-division-duplexing operations. By exploiting the energy-focusing property of lens arrays, jointly with the multipath sparsity of mmWave channels, the proposed channel estimation scheme requires only low-complexity two-way energy-based antenna selections and reduced-size MIMO channel estimation. Numerical results show that under limited RF chains and taking the channel training overhead and imperfect estimation into account, the proposed lens MIMO system achieves significantly higher throughput compared to the more complex benchmark system with the conventional uniform planar array and MIMO-orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing-based transmissions.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2779828","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8338166/08141416.pdf","startPage":"3239","endPage":"3251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2779828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation for Millimeter-Wave MIMO Communications With Lens Antenna Arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8141416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation for Millimeter-Wave MIMO Communications With Lens Antenna Arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141416/","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17713530","htmlLink":"/document/8141416/","volume":"67","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National University of Singapore under Research","grantNumber":"R-263-000-B62-112"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation for Millimeter-Wave MIMO Communications With Lens Antenna Arrays","sourcePdf":"tvt-zeng-2779828-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118487S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8141416","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8141417,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

It aims to optimize the total operational cost of the MGs through energy trading with neighboring MGs and the main grid in the real-time energy market. Various uncertainties including renewable generation, load consumption, and buying/selling prices of the main grid are handled using an adjustable robust optimization technique. To keep consistent with the distributed nature of the multiple MGs, we propose a distributed adjustable robust optimal scheduling algorithm. Within the framework, each MG energy management system determines its own selling price and operation schedule via distributed communication of noncritical information with its neighboring MGs. Robust optimal scheduling and fair energy trading can be collectively achieved. A case study of a 4-MG system is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2017.2779827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8576823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2017.2779827","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165391/8576823/08141420.pdf","startPage":"396","endPage":"406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Robust Energy Management of a Multimicrogrid System in the Real-Time Energy Market","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Robust Energy Management of a Multimicrogrid System in the Real-Time Energy Market","volume":"10","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8141420/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18345256","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141420/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51707069"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Image Processing and Intelligence Control, Wuhan, China","grantNumber":"IPIC2015-01"},{"fundingName":"DNV GL Energy (formerly KEMA) Technology Centre"},{"fundingName":"Energy Innovation Research Programme (EIRP)","grantNumber":"NRF2014EWT-EIRP002-005"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"51477103"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"S2014A030313564, 2015A010106017 and 2016KZDXM007"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Government","grantNumber":"JCYJ20160308104825040"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Robust Energy Management of a Multimicrogrid System in the Real-Time Energy Market","sourcePdf":"tste-li-2779827-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122717S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"8576823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"8576823","articleId":"8141420","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8141500,"authors":[{"name":"Frederik J.

We show that this potential-field estimation problem has deep-seated connections to Slepian's spatiospectral localization problem which seeks bandlimited spherical functions whose energy is optimally concentrated in some closed portion of the unit sphere. This allows us to formulate an alternative solution to the traditional damped least-squares spherical harmonic approach in geodesy, whereby the source field is now expanded in a truncated Slepian function basis set. We discuss the relative performance of both methods with regard to standard statistical measures such as bias, variance and mean squared error, and pay special attention to the algorithmic efficiency of computing the Slepian functions on the region complementary to the axisymmetric polar gap characteristic of satellite surveys. The ease, speed, and accuracy of our method make the use of spherical Slepian functions in earth and planetary geodesy practical.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.03065.x","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8141496/08141500.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.03065.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8141496","startPage":"1039","endPage":"1061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spherical Slepian functions and the polar gap in geodesy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8141500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","displayDocTitle":"Spherical Slepian functions and the polar gap in geodesy","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141500/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2006","isJournal":true,"volume":"166","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spherical Slepian functions and the polar gap in geodesy","sourcePdf":"16631039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025851S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","isNumber":"8141496","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"13","articleId":"8141500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8141597,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Wehland","firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Wehland"},{"name":"Roman Leonhardt","firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Leonhardt"},{"name":"Fabienne Vadeboin","firstName":"Fabienne","lastName":"Vadeboin"},{"name":"Erwin Appel","firstName":"Erwin","lastName":"Appel"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0956-540X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1365-246X"}],"articleNumber":"8141597","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["basalts","FORC","Henkel plot","magnetic interaction","palaeointensities"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8141597","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2005.02429.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2005.02429.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8141595","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8141595/08141597.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetic interaction analysis of basaltic samples and pre-selection for absolute palaeointensity measurements","abstract":"For a successful palaeointensity experiment a sample should only consists of non-interacting single domain (SD) particles. As this cannot be completely guarantied for natural samples we applied two different interaction methods (\u0394M plots and FORC-diagrams) on basaltic samples from Fernando de Noronha, Brazil, in order to determine the degree of interaction and estimate their use as a preselection tool for palaeointensity experiments. An independent classification of the samples in terms of SD/MD contribution and the occurrence of partial self-reversals is obtained by rockmagnetic means, Thellier-like experiments and continuous thermal demagnetization. The samples show a variable amount of mean interaction fields, which tends to be higher for samples with partial self-reversal. Nevertheless, high mean interaction fields can also be present in samples of successful palaeointensity experiments with high mean coercivities. This suggests, that the recording potential of a sample depends on the interplay of magnetic interaction and its mean coercivity, i.e. samples of higher mean coercivity resist higher mean interaction fields. As this is difficult to assess by normal rockmagnetic means, interaction measurements, especially the \u0394M plot derived parameters \u0394M 1 and 2, provide a fast tool for preselection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2005","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","volume":"162","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic interaction analysis of basaltic samples and pre-selection for absolute palaeointensity measurements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic interaction analysis of basaltic samples and pre-selection for absolute palaeointensity measurements","sourcePdf":"1622315.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02345S","chronDate":"Aug.  2005","isNumber":"8141595","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","articleId":"8141597","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8141701,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The proposed transform relies on an atomic decomposition of individual seismograms based on local multiscale chirps (swept frequency wave packets) of various shape and duration. We developed an algorithm that provides an optimal representation of the waveform packets in terms of (i) arrival time, (ii) central frequency, (iii) modulus, (iv) phase, (v) duration, (vi) envelope shape and (vii) frequency modulation compacting the information contained in each seismogram into a reduced set of parameters particularly well suited to describe seismic waveforms. In the present work, we focus on the ability of atomic decomposition to classify seismic events. We illustrate the developed methodology and resulting hierarchical classification scheme (agglomerative clustering displayed as a dendrogram) to seismograms of the induced seismicity recorded in the Lacq gas field between 1989 and 1997 by a local seismic network. For the present case-study, the resulting classification reveals different levels of similarity between seismic events of a same swarm. Accurate analysis of the subsequences of seismic events associated to an injection well shows temporal changes in the morphological attributes of the recorded seismic waveforms. These changes are highly correlated with water over-pressure records of the reservoir demonstrating the capability of the method to guide investigation of the underlying processes (properties of propagation media, source, rupture processes), and in a general manner the physical properties of the reservoir.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.03023.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.03023.x","startPage":"699","endPage":"718","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8141685/08141701.pdf","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8141685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of seismic waveforms and classification of seismic events using chirplet atomic decomposition.

However, the recent transport capacity upgrade, which drives the signal baud-rate from 10 to >100 Gbaud, has given rise to severe power fading at high-frequency ranges, induced at levels of both optoelectronic transceivers and optical networks. Especially, the modern meshed optical networks rely on more and more reconfigurable optical add and drop multiplexers (ROADM) to enhance the network flexibility with low latency. These cascaded ROADMs bring about a well-known filter-narrowing effect that has become a severe issue in the deployed networks. This strongly limits the achievable channel bandwidth, and leads to an optical channel with colored signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Within the linear transmission regime, the capacity-approaching strategy for an individual wavelength channel is to design a Gaussian source, which has been extensively studied recently. However, there is the lack of investigation on approaching the capacity of a channel with colored SNR. This paper addresses this issue with rigor. It reviews the optimum power allocation that determines the capacity of colored-SNR Gaussian channels, and proposes entropy loading based on multicarrier modulation that offers a theoretically optimum strategy to approach the capacity. The entropy loading advantage is verified by a 400-Gb/s coherent optical transmission through band-limited fiber channels with cascaded ROADMs. Entropy loading can be generalized to a variety of applications under colored-SNR Gaussian channels beyond the optical communication.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2778290","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8290587/08141854.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"78","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2778290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8290587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approaching the Capacity of Colored-SNR Optical Channels by Multicarrier Entropy Loading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8141854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141854/","displayDocTitle":"Approaching the Capacity of Colored-SNR Optical Channels by Multicarrier Entropy Loading","volume":"36","issue":"1","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17595691","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8141854/","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approaching the Capacity of Colored-SNR Optical Channels by Multicarrier Entropy Loading","sourcePdf":"jlt-che-2778290-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143528S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8290587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8290587","articleId":"8141854","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8141856,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8141856/wang-2779804-small.gif","p":["Li Wang received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China, in 2002, 2005, and 2013, respectively.

Due to the ever-increasing demand for bandwidth resulted from the rapid development of data-intensive services in recent years, one of the fundamental challenges for satellite communications is to continuously improve utilization efficiency of the scarce satellite spectrum. Cognitive satellite communications address the problem by providing mechanisms for terrestrial and satellite users to dynamically access idle bands of licensed satellite networks, hence enabling spectrum sharing between two satellite systems or between satellite and terrestrial systems. In this paper, we investigate a distributed technique of spectrum sharing for cognitive satellite networks. In order to cater for situations with incomplete decision information, the proposed scheme is based on the Bayesian equilibrium theory. We first develop a spectrum allocation scheme by studying the action strategy of terrestrial cognitive terminals in a distributed competition. A feasible spectrum allocation scheme that caters for cases of incomplete user information is then developed as an extension of the basic scheme by formulating the problem as a Cournot game model. By identifying the unique equilibrium in this model, optimal spectrum allocation for cognitive satellite networks can be achieved. Essential discussions and proofs for the rationality of this method and uniqueness of the equilibrium are provided. Numerical results are given to justify the claimed advantages.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Optimization for Cognitive Satellite Communications With Cournot Game Model","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2779804","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08141856.pdf","startPage":"1624","endPage":"1634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2779804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8141856","topic":"Cloud and Big Data-based Next-generation Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141856/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Optimization for Cognitive Satellite Communications With Cournot Game Model","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8141856/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17573746","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51404211 and 61601221"},{"fundingName":"BAE Systems"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Spectrum Optimization for Cognitive Satellite Communications With Cournot Game Model","sourcePdf":"access-li-2779804-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118368S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Cloud and Big Data-based Next-generation Cognitive Radio Networks"],"articleId":"8141856","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8141858,"authors":[{"name":"Ashutosh Rao","affiliation":["Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/8253565/8141858/rao-2779869-small.gif","p":["Ashutosh Rao (S\u201916) received the B.Tech. and M.Tech. degrees in\n engineering physics from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India, in 2013.

Driven by the potential critical missions, such as transportation safety and video surveillance that require high throughput and lowpower consumption, we investigate the small-cell assisted traffic offloading for NB-IoT systems. Taking into account the offloading through small cells operating on unlicensed bands, we account for the secrecy-outage issue in which some malicious eavesdroppers might intentionally overhead the offloaded data delivered to small cells. We first formulate a joint traffic scheduling and power allocation problem to minimize the total power consumption of SDs, while satisfying both the traffic throughput requirement and secrecy-requirement. Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal offloading solution. With the per-SD's optimal offloading solution, we further investigate a multi-SDs multi access-points (APs) scenario, in which different SDs select different APs for providing offloading service to minimize the overall offloading-cost for all SDs. Specifically, we formulate an optimal SD-AP pairing problem to find the optimal pairing between the SDs and APs. Numerical results have been provided to validate our proposed algorithm and show the performance gain of our proposed traffic offloading for the NB-IoT systems.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2779820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2779820","startPage":"1516","endPage":"1526","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8375923/08141859.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8375923","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small-Cell Assisted Secure Traffic Offloading for Narrowband Internet of Thing (NB-IoT) Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","displayDocTitle":"Small-Cell Assisted Secure Traffic Offloading for Narrowband Internet of Thing (NB-IoT) Systems","publicationDate":"June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 June 2018","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8141859/","accessionNumber":"17840455","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141859/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572440 and 61379122"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LR17F010002 and LR16F010003"},{"fundingName":"Young Talent Cultivation Project of Zhejiang Association for Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2016YCGC011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small-Cell Assisted Secure Traffic Offloading for Narrowband Internet of Thing (NB-IoT) Systems","sourcePdf":"jiot-wu-2779820-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136088S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8375923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8375923","articleId":"8141859","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8141861,"authors":[{"name":"Jiansheng Guan","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China","High-Voltage Key Laboratory of Fujian Province, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8141861/guan-2779940-small.gif","p":["Jiansheng Guan was born in China in 1981.

A Takagi-Sugeuo-Kang fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller is adopted, and the parameters are regulated by the derived adaptable rules according to a Lyapunov function. The robust compensation controller mitigates approximation-based errors. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed RATFC can achieve improved tracking performance compared with other neural network controllers.","topic":"New Developments on Reliable Control and Filtering of Complex Nonlinear Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141861/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8141861/","accessionNumber":"17573747","displayDocTitle":"Robust Adaptive Tracking Control for Manipulators Based on a TSK Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003392","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China","grantNumber":"2017J01782"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573296 and 61473329"},{"fundingName":"National Science Council of Taiwan","grantNumber":"NSC98-2221-E-155-059-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Robust Adaptive Tracking Control for Manipulators Based on a TSK Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller","sourcePdf":"access-guan-2779940-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081353S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["New Developments on Reliable Control and Filtering of Complex Nonlinear Systems"],"articleId":"8141861","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8141873,"authors":[{"name":"Fazle Karim","affiliation":["Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8141873/karim-2779939-small.gif","p":["Fazle Karim received the B.Sc. degree in industrial engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign in 2012, the M.Sc. degree in industrial engineering from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2016.

The current demand for machine-type communications (MTC) has resulted in a variety of communication technologies with diverse service requirements to achieve the modern IoT vision. More recent cellular standards like long-term evolution (LTE) have been introduced for mobile devices but are not well suited for low-power and low data rate devices such as the IoT devices. To address this, there is a number of emerging IoT standards. Fifth generation (5G) mobile network, in particular, aims to address the limitations of previous cellular standards and be a potential key enabler for future IoT. In this paper, the state-of-the-art of the IoT application requirements along with their associated communication technologies are surveyed. In addition, the third generation partnership project cellular-based low-power wide area solutions to support and enable the new service requirements for Massive to Critical IoT use cases are discussed in detail, including extended coverage global system for mobile communications for the Internet of Things, enhanced machine-type communications, and narrowband-Internet of Things. Furthermore, 5G new radio enhancements for new service requirements and enabling technologies for the IoT are introduced. This paper presents a comprehensive review related to emerging and enabling technologies with main focus on 5G mobile networks that is envisaged to support the exponential traffic growth for enabling the IoT. The challenges and open research directions pertinent to the deployment of massive to critical IoT applications are also presented in coming up with an efficient context-aware congestion control

sparse code multiple access systems, combined message passing algorithm (MPA), and the compressed sensing (CS) technique, referred to as a CS-aided MPA detector. Specifically, the detector is divided into a two-step procedure, i.e., initial detection and sparse error correction. In the first step, MPA with a few iterations is employed as initial detection. In the second step, based on the observation that the symbol error produced by initial detection tends to be sparse, we propose a CS-based greedy pursuit algorithm, called threshold-aided adaptive subspace pursuit, to estimate the error accurately. Then, the final estimated vector is obtained by adding the initial estimated vector produced by MPA to the estimated error vector. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CS-aided MPA detector provides very similar symbol error rate performance compared with the original one with substantially reduced complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141880/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","volume":"22","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"17683503","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8141880/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity CS-Aided MPA Detector for SCMA Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Huawei HIRP","grantNumber":"YB2015040056"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61631004"},{"fundingName":"Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Fund","grantNumber":"2012JQ0020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity CS-Aided MPA Detector for SCMA Systems","sourcePdf":"lcomm-du-2779859-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067157S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8334015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8334015","articleId":"8141880","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8141881,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Song","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Information Science of Electromagnetic Waves (MoE), Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8141881/song-2779875-small.gif","p":["Qian Song (S\u201916) received the B.E. degree (Hons.) from the School of Information Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China, in 2015.

However, the vast majority of SAR images are not fully polarimetric (full-pol). This paper proposes \u201cradar image colorization\u201dto reconstruct a full-pol image from a nonfull-pol image, so that existing PolSAR methods, such as model-based decomposition and unsupervised classification, can be directly applied to the reconstructed full-pol SAR images. It proposes to train a specially designed deep neural network to convert a single polarization gray-scale SAR image to full-pol. It consists of two components: a feature extractor network to extract hierarchical multi-scale spatial features of the grayscale SAR image, followed by a feature translator network to map spatial feature to polarimetric feature with which the polarimetric covariance matrix of each pixel can be reconstructed. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments with real full-pol data are conducted to show the efficacy of the proposed method. The reconstructed full-pol SAR image agrees well with the true full-pol image, not only in the sense of visual similarity but also in the sense of real PolSAR applications, such as target decomposition and terrain classification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141881/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17573751","htmlLink":"/document/8141881/","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Radar Image Colorization: Converting Single-Polarization to Fully Polarimetric Using Deep Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFB0502700"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571134"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Radar Image Colorization: Converting Single-Polarization to Fully Polarimetric Using Deep Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"access-xu-2779875-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068607S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8141881","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8141884,"authors":[{"name":"Alfonso Rojas-Dom\u00ednguez","affiliation":["Tecnol\u00f3gico Nacional de M\u00e9xico\u2013Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Le\u00f3n, Le\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8141884/rojas-2779794-small.gif","p":["Alfonso Rojas-Dom\u00ednguez was born in Mexico City, Mexico, in 1978.

However, the frame structure overhead of each LAA downlink burst varies with the ending time of each preceding LBT operation. Given that, the existing analytic models of Wi-Fi cannot be used to evaluate the performance of LAA due to the fact that, unlike Wi-Fi, LAA frame structure overhead varies with the ending time of the preceding LBT operation. In this letter, we propose a novel Markov chain-based analytic model to cope with the variation of the LAA frame structure overhead. Comparison between analysis and simulation results shows that the difference between them is merely 0.2% on average, demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed model.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2779752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2779752","startPage":"1236","endPage":"1239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8375700/08141885.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8375700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of LTE-LAA Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of LTE-LAA Network","volume":"22","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17838989","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8141885/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"ICT R&D program of MSIT/IITP, Republic of Korea"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of LTE-LAA Network","sourcePdf":"lcomm-choi-2779752-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086952S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8375700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8375700","articleId":"8141885","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8141906,"authors":[{"name":"Shibsankar Das","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Patna, Patna, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8269342/8141906/das-2780050-small.gif","p":["Shibsankar Das (SM\u201917) received the Bachelor's degree from\n the Department of Mathematics, Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur, India, and the Master's\n degree from the Department of Pure Mathematics, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India, in 2010 and 2012,\n respectively.

Then, we propose a multiplier-free implementation of this generator based on multiplexers and read-only memories (ROMs). Our proposed algorithm generalizes the previous PU generator for complementary pairs by Budi\u0161in and Spasojevi\u0107.

Each chip includes four transmit (Tx) and two receive (Rx) channels working at Kaand K-band, respectively. The proposed architecture enables a half-duplex operating mode in two different bands. Its development was driven taking into account the integration into a realistic Tx/Rx shared aperture phased array architecture. Full amplitude and phase control are provided for each channel with high granularity (65536 states). The measured results demonstrate the validity of the proposed chip architecture, even though the channel output power and the noise figure (NF) are not in full agreement with the simulations. In Tx mode, the channel provides 9.47 dB of gain with 4.19-dBm output power at 1-dB compression. In Rx mode, the channel gain is 21.6 dB with an NF of 5 dB. In a scenario with 5.265\u00b0 phase steps and 8-dB amplitude tapering capability, the amplitude and phase root-mean-square (RMS) errors within the Tx bandwidth (29.5-30.8 GHz) are equal to 0.52 dB and 3.74\u00b0, respectively. The amplitude and phase RMS errors in the Rx bandwidth (19.7-21 GHz) are equal to 2.05 dB and 12.11\u00b0, respectively. The chip consumes 340 mW in Tx and 242 mW in Rx mode and occupies 3.3 \u00d7 3.5 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"

More precisely, the evolution of a parasitic signal called random telegraph signal (RTS) is analyzed through several photodiode designs. It is shown that the population of pixels exhibiting this fluctuation depends on the design variants. This population also increases in a different way with the dose: the effects are not the same considering a low or high X-rays irradiation. Moreover, a statistical analysis is realized in order to better characterize the defects responsible for RTS.

We provide new insights related to the empirical and theoretical analysis of these algorithms when used with Fourier measurements and combined with convex priors. In particular, we show that Fienup methods can be viewed as performing alternating minimization on a regularized nonconvex least-squares problem with respect to amplitude measurements. Furthermore, we prove that under mild additional structural assumptions on the prior (semialgebraicity), the sequence of signal estimates has a smooth convergent behavior toward a critical point of the nonconvex regularized least-squares objective. Finally, we propose an extension to Fienup techniques, based on a projected gradient descent interpretation and acceleration using inertial terms.

Heterogeneous fading channels from PU to multiple SUs, PU's traffic distribution, limited SU's power and multiple SUs' access contention impact both these two conflicting objectives. In this paper, we study the joint impact of these four factors on the tradeoff. More specifically, we consider that the channels from PU to SUs are exposed to non-identically independent free space path losses, PU's traffic randomly arrives and departs from the channel, every SU's average power consumption is limited, while multiple SUs contend to transmit. We first model the impact of these factors on SUs' spectrum sensing and data transmission. Then, we formulate the tradeoff aiming at maximizing SUs' aggregated throughput under two constraints: 1) interference probability to PU and 2) SUs' average power consumption. To solve the optimization problem, we design a novel cluster based particle swarm optimization (C-PSO) algorithm. By iteratively updating the particles in a cluster based on the comparison of their fitnesses, the cluster converges to the optimal solution rapidly. Simulation results validate the feasibility of the C-PSO algorithm and the outperformance of our proposal compared against related contributions which consider the homogeneous fading channel. They also show how the optimal solution varies with path losses and PU's traffic distribution.","doi":"10.1109/TCCN.2017.2779858","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687307/8307506/08141922.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8307506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2017.2779858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Heterogeneous Fading Channels in Power Limited Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8141922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Heterogeneous Fading Channels in Power Limited Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141922/","volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8141922/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17633504","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471376, 61401492 and 61601480"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Heterogeneous Fading Channels in Power Limited Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tccn-zhang-2779858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133879S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"8307506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","xplore-issue":"8307506","articleId":"8141922","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8141935,"authors":[{"name":"G.

An alternative force control technique for MSPM machines is presented. The mathematical model of the machine and the theoretical investigation of the force production principle are provided. A novel force control methodology based on the minimization of the copper losses is described and adopted to calculate the d-q axis current references. The predicted performances of the considered machine are benchmarked against finite-element analysis.

In the front-end, features are extracted and compressed to transmit over a wireless channel to a back-end server, where the incoming stream is received and reconstructed for recognition tasks. In this paper, we propose a feature compression algorithm termed suppression by selecting wavelets (SSW) to achieve the two main goals of DSR: Minimizing memory and device requirements while also maintaining or even improving the recognition performance. The SSW approach first applies the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to filter the incoming speech feature sequence into two temporal subsequences at the client terminal. Feature compression is achieved by keeping the low (modulation) frequency subsequence while discarding the high frequency counterpart. The low-frequency subsequence is then transmitted across the remote network for specific feature statistics normalization. Wavelets are favorable for resolving the temporal properties of the feature sequence, and the down-sampling process in DWT achieves data compression by reducing the amount of data at the terminal prior to transmission across the network. Once the compressed features have arrived at the server, the feature sequence can be enhanced by statistics normalization, reconstructed with inverse DWT, and compensated with a simple post filter to alleviate any over-smoothing effects from the compression stage. Results on a standard robustness task (Aurora-4) and on a Mandarin Chinese news corpus showed SSW outperforms conventional noise-robustness techniques while also providing nearly a 50% compression rate during the transmission stage of DSR systems.","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/8253682/08141944.pdf","startPage":"564","endPage":"579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suppression by Selecting Wavelets for Feature Compression in Distributed Speech Recognition","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2017.2779787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8253682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2017.2779787","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8141944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141944/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Suppression by Selecting Wavelets for Feature Compression in Distributed Speech Recognition","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17485421","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8141944/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST104-2221-E-001-026-MY2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suppression by Selecting Wavelets for Feature Compression in Distributed Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"taslp-tsao-2779787-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155154S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8253682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8253682","articleId":"8141944","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8141947,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelmohsen Ali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada","RiotMicro, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8338166/8141947/ali-2779982-small.gif","p":["Abdelmohsen Ali was born in Giza, Egypt, in 1982.

A window-based autocorrelation is utilized to provide the power spectral density of the quantized signal. Closed-form expressions are derived for the one-bit quantized correlation, where the critical impact of the ultralow resolution is quantified. It is shown that the introduced method can still provide enough information about the sparse spectrum even at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). A suboptimal detection algorithm is presented to sense whether individual subbands are occupied or vacant. To evaluate the detection algorithm, the probability of false alarm and probability of detection are simulated for various system parameters. The sensing performance and the accuracy of the offered expressions are justified through comparisons with respective results from computer simulations. When compared to other methods, in addition to the significant saving in power, results indicate that, with the proper parameter selection and SNR down to -12 dBs, the proposed method provides low complexity, low sensing period, and better performance for less sparsity levels even though an aggressive quantization has been applied.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2779982","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8338166/08141947.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2779982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338166","startPage":"3269","endPage":"3283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Efficient Wideband Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8141947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power-Efficient Wideband Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141947/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699000","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8141947/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"N00861"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Efficient Wideband Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-hamouda-2779982-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127709S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8141947","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8141949,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, given the real-time performance requirements, we consider a network supporting k-SIC, and study how to minimize aggregate power consumptions of user equipments for uplink transmissions by jointly addressing power allocation and user scheduling. We show that the problem is solvable in polynomial time in the case of continuous transmit powers by an algorithm with complexity of O(nlog(n)), where n is the number of user equipments. In the case of discrete transmit powers, the problem is shown to be polynomially solvable for 2-SIC, and we also propose an approximation algorithm for k-SIC where k > 2. Experimental evaluations reveal that the real-time performances have tremendous impacts on both the aggregate power consumption and the maximum of the transmit powers of user equipments. Besides, the usability of SIC in low-power applications is also shown by experimental evaluations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Scheduling for Uplink Transmissions in SIC-Based Industrial Wireless Networks With Guaranteed Real-Time Performance","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2779784","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8338166/08141966.pdf","startPage":"3216","endPage":"3228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2779784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338166","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8141966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141966/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Scheduling for Uplink Transmissions in SIC-Based Industrial Wireless Networks With Guaranteed Real-Time Performance","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8141966/","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699038","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61702487"},{"fundingName":"Science Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China","grantNumber":"ZX20150089"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Scheduling for Uplink Transmissions in SIC-Based Industrial Wireless Networks With Guaranteed Real-Time Performance","sourcePdf":"tvt-xu-2779784-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128793S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8141966","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8141968,"authors":[{"name":"Gong Jian","affiliation":["Development Center of Computer and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Control Engineering, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/8552518/8141968/jian-2779874-small.gif","p":["Gong Jian received the B.Eng. degree in computer science and engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 1997, and the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees from the China Academy of Space Technology, Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2010, respectively.","He is an Associate Professor of computer science and technology with the Beijing Institute of Control Engineering, Beijing.

Toward these problems, we present a programmable architecture called neural network architecture-based virtual reconfigurable circuit (NNA-VRC), and an evolutionary fault tolerance method based on this programmable architecture. The NNA-VRC-based evolution method simplifies the structure and configuration of programmable architecture, avoids illegal interconnections during the circuit evolution, and implements high level (module level) evolution.

Different from the existing research, we investigate the throughput and energy efficiency of a general class of multiple-input and multiple-output systems with arbitrary inputs when they are subject to statistical quality-of-service (QoS) constraints, which are imposed as limits on the delay violation and buffer overflow probabilities. We employ the effective capacity as the performance metric, which is the maximum constant data arrival rate at a buffer that can be sustained by the channel service process under specified QoS constraints. We obtain the optimal input covariance matrix that maximizes the effective capacity under a short-term average power constraint. Following that, we perform an asymptotic analysis of the effective capacity in the low signal-to-noise ratio and large-scale antenna regimes. In the low signal-to-noise ratio regime analysis, in order to determine the minimum energy-per-bit and also the slope of the effective capacity versus energy-per-bit curve at the minimum energy-per-bit, we utilize the first and second derivatives of the effective capacity when the signal-to-noise ratio approaches zero. We observe that the minimum energy-per-bit is independent of the input distribution, whereas the slope depends on the input distribution. In the large-scale antenna analysis, we show that the effective capacity approaches the average transmission rate in the channel with the increasing number of transmit and/or receive antennas. Particularly, the gap between the effective capacity and the average transmission rate in the channel, which is caused by the QoS constraints, is minimized with the number of antennas. In addition, we put forward the nonasymptotic backlog and delay violation bounds by utilizing the effective capacity. Finally, we substantiate our analytical results through numerical illustrations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective Capacity in MIMO Channels With Arbitrary Inputs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2779980","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8338166/08141973.pdf","startPage":"3252","endPage":"3268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2779980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338166","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8141973","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/25/8338166/8141973-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141973/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Effective Capacity in MIMO Channels With Arbitrary Inputs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8141973/","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699025","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010663","fundingName":"H2020 European Research Council","grantNumber":"306644"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1618615"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Effective Capacity in MIMO Channels With Arbitrary Inputs","sourcePdf":"tvt-hammouda-2779980-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139727S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8141973","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8141978,"authors":[{"name":"Ziyang Cheng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8259460/8141978/cheng-2780052-small.gif","p":["Ziyang Cheng (S\u201917) was born in Yingcheng, Hubei, China, in\n 1990.

Owing to this kind of signal dependence and constraints, the formulated optimization problem of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) maximization is NP-hard. To this end, an auxiliary variable is first introduced to modify the original problem, and then a primal-dual algorithm based on the block successive upper-bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUM-M) is developed to deal with the resulting problem. Moreover, an active set method is exploited to solve the quadratic programming problem involved in each update procedure of the proposed BSUM-M algorithm. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art methods in terms of the output SINR, beampattern, computational complexity, pulse compression, and ambiguity properties.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2780052","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8259460/08141978.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2780052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8259460","startPage":"968","endPage":"981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Radar Waveform Design With PAPR and Similarity Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8141978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Radar Waveform Design With PAPR and Similarity Constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15, 15 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8141978/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"4","publicationDate":"15 Feb.15, 2018","accessionNumber":"17535327","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8141978/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671139 and 61301266"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds of Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2016J027"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds of Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2016J027"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Department of Education of Guangdong","grantNumber":"2016KTSCX125"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Radar Waveform Design With PAPR and Similarity Constraints","sourcePdf":"tsp-cheng-2780052-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15206S","chronDate":"Feb.15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8259460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"8259460","articleId":"8141978","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8141979,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The approach consists of running an explicit finite difference time domain (TD) code with a time harmonic source out to steady-state. The magnitudes and phases at locations in the model are computed using phase sensitive detection (PSD). PSD does not require storage of time-series (unlike a fast Fourier transform), reducing its memory requirements. Additionally, the response from multiple sources can be obtained from a single finite difference run by encoding each source with a different frequency. For 2-D models with many sources, this time domain phase sensitive detection (TD\u2014PSD) approach has a higher arithmetic complexity than direct solution of the finite difference frequency domain (FD) equations using nested dissection re-ordering (FD\u2014ND). The storage requirements for 2-D finite difference TD\u2014PSD are lower than FD\u2014ND.

A classic technique to solve a minimization problem is to successively determine the minimum of a series of linearized problems. This formulation requires the Fr\u00e9chet derivatives (the Jacobian matrix), which can be expensive to compute. If the minimization is viewed as a non-linear optimization problem, only the gradient of the error functional is needed. This gradient can be computed without the Fr\u00e9chet derivatives. In the 1970s, the adjoint-state method was developed to efficiently compute the gradient. It is now a well-known method in the numerical community for computing the gradient of a functional with respect to the model parameters when this functional depends on those model parameters through state variables, which are solutions of the forward problem. However, this method is less well understood in the geophysical community. The goal of this paper is to review the adjoint-state method. The idea is to define some adjoint-state variables that are solutions of a linear system. The adjoint-state variables are independent of the model parameter perturbations and in a way gather the perturbations with respect to the state variables. The adjoint-state method is efficient because only one extra linear system needs to be solved.Several applications are presented. When applied to the computation of the derivatives of the ray trajectories, the link with the propagator of the perturbed ray equation is established.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.02978.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.02978.x","startPage":"495","endPage":"503","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8142699/08142700.pdf","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8142699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A review of the adjoint-state method for computing the gradient of a functional with geophysical applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","displayDocTitle":"A review of the adjoint-state method for computing the gradient of a functional with geophysical applications","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","volume":"167","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8142700/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A review of the adjoint-state method for computing the gradient of a functional with geophysical applications","sourcePdf":"1672495.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017862S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","isNumber":"8142699","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"42","articleId":"8142700","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":8142922,"authors":[{"name":"Ignace Loris","firstName":"Ignace","lastName":"Loris"},{"name":"Guust Nolet","firstName":"Guust","lastName":"Nolet"},{"name":"Ingrid Daubechies","firstName":"Ingrid","lastName":"Daubechies"},{"name":"F.

The presence of noise on data sets renders such interpolation more difficult and many applications (known as expansions) of the GSE can be shown to intolerably amplify noise. However, many key expansions can be shown to successfully interpolate noisy data and even, given limited gradient error and sufficiently narrow line-spacing, reduce noise. These results can be shown to hold for both random noise and along-line correlated (levelling error type) noise. Unfortunately, the only expansion capable of interpolating a data set sampled at 3\u00d7 conventional line-spacing, the Three-rectangle expansion, has a poor noise response and always acts to amplify data error. The GSE method bares up well against other methods of gradient enhanced interpolation; in numerical tests several expansions for the gravity field produce less noisy output than any of the pseudo-line, gradient enhanced minimum curvature or gradient enhanced Akima spline methods. Despite edge effects and using only gradient data with no gravity component, the GSE applied to real undersampled survey data bares up well against conventional interpolation, reducing noise where the data are clearly undersampled.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8143247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04193.x","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8143247/08143251.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"650","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04193.x","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized sampling interpolation of noisy gravity/gravity gradient data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Generalized sampling interpolation of noisy gravity/gravity gradient data","volume":"178","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8143251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized sampling interpolation of noisy gravity/gravity gradient data","sourcePdf":"1782638.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034492S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","isNumber":"8143247","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","articleId":"8143251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8143668,"authors":[{"name":"Arash JafarGandomi","firstName":"Arash","lastName":"JafarGandomi"},{"name":"Hiroshi Takenaka","firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Takenaka"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0956-540X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1365-246X"}],"articleNumber":"8143668","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Numerical approximations and analysis","Computational seismology","Wave propagation"]}],"abstract":"A scheme for the non-standard finite-difference method in the time-domain (NS-FDTD), 2-Box scheme, is proposed for elastic wave simulations in two dimensions (P-SV). The method improves the accuracy and efficiently reduces grid dispersion and anisotropy. The proposed non-standard scheme is based on two main operations. The first operation replaces spatial grid spacing and time step by their frequency optimized counterparts, called the correction functions, and the second operation introduces an optimum grid stencil for the finite-difference operator of the 2-D Laplacian. The optimal stencil is obtained by introducing two optimization parameters estimated for a design frequency. Error analysis of the proposed scheme (2-Box scheme) shows that specifying the maximum frequency as the design frequency leads to a significant reduction of the grid dispersion over a wide frequency band. We derive the formulations of grid dispersion and stability condition for the scheme. The grid dispersion is investigated, and it is shown that the proposed scheme reduces not only the grid dispersion but also the grid anisotropy significantly. The grid dispersion is insensitive to the Poisson's ratio and size of the time step within the stability limit. Since the wide spatial stencil of the 2-Box scheme might become difficult to implement at the computational domain boundaries, two additional non-standard schemes-1-Box and 0-Box schemes-are also introduced. The 1-Box scheme uses narrower stencil than the 2-Box scheme, and the 0-Box scheme uses the same stencil as the standard FDTD. Numerical experiments of elastic wave propagation demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed non-standard schemes over the commonly used standard one. With six grid spacings per minimum wavelength, the 2-Box and 1-Box schemes represent excellent results and the 0-Box scheme has higher accuracy than the standard scheme with seven grid spacings per minimum wavelength.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04101.x","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8143650/08143668.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04101.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8143650","startPage":"282","endPage":"302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-standard FDTD for elastic wave simulation: two-dimensional P-SV case","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8143668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","displayDocTitle":"Non-standard FDTD for elastic wave simulation: two-dimensional P-SV case","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8143668/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"178","issue":"1","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-standard FDTD for elastic wave simulation: two-dimensional P-SV case","sourcePdf":"1781282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023119S","chronDate":"July  2009","isNumber":"8143650","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","articleId":"8143668","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8143741,"authors":[{"name":"David Mich\u00e9a","firstName":"David","lastName":"Mich\u00e9a"},{"name":"Dimitri Komatitsch","firstName":"Dimitri","lastName":"Komatitsch"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0956-540X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1365-246X"}],"articleNumber":"8143741","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Numerical solutions","Numerical approximations and analysis","Earthquake ground motions","Computational seismology","Wave propagation"]}],"abstract":"We accelerate a 3-D finite-difference in the time domain wave propagation code by a factor between about 20 and 60 compared to a serial implementation using graphics processing unit computing on NVIDIA graphics cards with the CUDA programming language.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO)\u2014a global optimization technique is applied to interpret this amplitude in terms of the horizontal location and depth, constant (related to magnetization) and various source geometries through structural indices. Applicability of the proposed technique is evaluated through the analyses of simulated magnetic anomalies (noise-free and corrupted with 20 per cent random noise) over different types of source geometries, namely, a thin dyke and a contact with high accuracy in parameter estimation. Studies on the choices of search parameter space reveal that a relatively wide search space can be assigned. Practical applicability of the proposed technique has been demonstrated through three magnetic anomaly profiles digitized from published literature. The results of PSO, Euler deconvolution, enhanced local wavenumber and drill hole are comparable. PSO results also seem to be more stable than other techniques.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2010.04631.x","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8143751/08143760.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2010.04631.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8143751","startPage":"652","endPage":"662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inversion of the amplitude of the two-dimensional analytic signal of the magnetic anomaly by the particle swarm optimization technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8143760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","displayDocTitle":"Inversion of the amplitude of the two-dimensional analytic signal of the magnetic anomaly by the particle swarm optimization technique","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8143760/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"182","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inversion of the amplitude of the two-dimensional analytic signal of the magnetic anomaly by the particle swarm optimization technique","sourcePdf":"1822652.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053159S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","isNumber":"8143751","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8143760","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-26"},{"_id":8144047,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For each source we estimate the apparent slowness and propagation azimuth of the first wave arrival. Since both source and receiver positions are accurately known, we are able to interpret the results in terms of the effect of the heterogeneities of the medium on wave propagation. The results show the presence of significant propagation anomalies. Nearby shots produce large apparent slowness values above 0.6 s km\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u22121</sup>\n, while distant shots produce small values, down to about 0.15\u20130.20 s km\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u22121</sup>\n. These values are different for each array, which shows the importance of the local structure under the receiver. The spatial distributions of apparent slowness are not radial as we would expect in a flat-layered medium. And again, these distributions are different for each array. The azimuth anomalies defined as the difference between the empirical estimates and the values expected in a 1-D model (i.e. the source-array directions) suggest ubiquitous wave front distortions. We have detected both positive and negative anomalies. For some shot-array geometries, azimuth anomalies are quite large with values up to 60\u00b0. The distribution of the anomalies depends on the position of the array. Some of these features can be interpreted in terms of a shallow magma chamber and shallow rigid bodies imaged by high-resolution seismic tomography. However several details remain unexplained. Further work is required, including modelling of synthetic wavefields on realistic models of Deception Island and/or apparent slowness vector tomography.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8144047/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"184","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative analysis of seismic wave propagation anomalies in azimuth and apparent slowness at Deception Island volcano (Antarctica) using seismic arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative analysis of seismic wave propagation anomalies in azimuth and apparent slowness at Deception Island volcano (Antarctica) using seismic arrays","sourcePdf":"1842801.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022173S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","isNumber":"8144026","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8144047","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8144112,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Multicomponent seismic data can, in principle, circumvent this limitation but adds to the complexity of the inversion algorithm because it requires simultaneous optimization of multiple objective functions, one for each data component. In seismology, these multiple objectives are typically handled by constructing a single objective given as a weighted sum of the objectives of individual data components and sometimes with additional regularization terms reflecting their interdependence; which is then followed by a single objective optimization. Multi-objective problems, inclusive of the multicomponent seismic inversion are however non-linear. They have non-unique solutions, known as the Pareto-optimal solutions. Therefore, casting such problems as a single objective optimization provides one out of the entire set of the Pareto-optimal solutions, which in turn, may be biased by the choice of the weights. To handle multiple objectives, it is thus appropriate to treat the objective as a vector and simultaneously optimize each of its components so that the entire Pareto-optimal set of solutions could be estimated. This paper proposes such a novel multi-objective methodology using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm for waveform inversion of multicomponent seismic data. The applicability of the method is demonstrated using synthetic data generated from multilayer models based on a real well log. We document that the proposed method can reliably extract subsurface elastic parameters and density from multicomponent seismic data both when the subsurface is considered isotropic and transversely isotropic with a vertical symmetry axis. We also compute approximate uncertainty values in the derived parameters. Although we restrict our inversion applications to horizontally stratified models, we outline a practical procedure of extending the method to approximately include local dips for each source\u2013receiver offset pair. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method is not just limited to seismic inversion but it could be used to invert different data types not only requiring multiple objectives but also multiple physics to describe them.","doi":"10.1093/gji/ggt460","startPage":"1600","endPage":"1618","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggt460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8144177","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8144177/08144183.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicomponent pre-stack seismic waveform inversion in transversely isotropic media using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8144183/","displayDocTitle":"Multicomponent pre-stack seismic waveform inversion in transversely isotropic media using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm","volume":"196","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicomponent pre-stack seismic waveform inversion in transversely isotropic media using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"ggt460.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020887S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","isNumber":"8144177","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8144183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8144363,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Piscini","firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Piscini"},{"name":"Elisa Carboni","firstName":"Elisa","lastName":"Carboni"},{"name":"Fabio Del Frate","firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Del Frate"},{"name":"Roy Gordon Grainger","firstName":"Roy Gordon","lastName":"Grainger"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0956-540X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1365-246X"}],"articleNumber":"8144363","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8144363","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image processing","Neural networks, fuzzy logic","Inverse theory","Volcanic gases","Remote sensing of volcanoes","Volcano monitoring"]}],"doi":"10.1093/gji/ggu152","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8144356/08144363.pdf","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","startPage":"697","endPage":"709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8144356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggu152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous retrieval of volcanic sulphur dioxide and plume height from hyperspectral data using artificial neural networks","abstract":"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a valuable and well-established inversion technique for the estimation of geophysical parameters from satellite images; once trained, they help generate very fast results.

For instance, stress distributions in the heart affect cardiac remodelling, but such distributions are not presently accessible in patients. Biomechanical models of the heart offer detailed three-dimensional deformation, stress and strain fields that can supplement conventional clinical data. In this work, we introduce dynamic computational models of the human left ventricle (LV) that are derived from clinical imaging data obtained from a healthy subject and from a patient with a myocardial infarction (MI). Both models incorporate a detailed invariant-based orthotropic description of the passive elasticity of the ventricular myocardium along with a detailed biophysical model of active tension generation in the ventricular muscle. These constitutive models are employed within a dynamic simulation framework that accounts for the inertia of the ventricular muscle and the blood that is based on an immersed boundary (IB) method with a finite element description of the structural mechanics. The geometry of the models is based on data obtained non-invasively by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). CMR imaging data are also used to estimate the parameters of the passive and active constitutive models, which are determined so that the simulated end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes agree with the corresponding volumes determined from the CMR imaging studies.

Plumes are ubiquitous on a wide range of scales in both the natural and the man-made environments. Examples that immediately come to mind are the vapour plumes above industrial smoke stacks or the ash plumes forming particle-laden clouds above an erupting volcano. However, plumes also occur where they are less visually apparent, such as the rising stream of warmair above a domestic radiator, of oil from a subsea blowout or, at a larger scale, of air above the so-called urban heat island. In many instances, not only the plume itself is of interest but also its influence on the environment as a whole through the process of entrainment. Zeldovich (1937, The asymptotic laws of freely-ascending convective flows. Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz., 7, 1463\u20131465 (in Russian)), Batchelor (1954, Heat convection and buoyancy effects in fluids. Q. J. R. Meteor. Soc., 80, 339\u2013358) and Morton et al. (1956, Turbulent gravitational convection from maintained and instantaneous sources. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, 234, 1\u201323) laid the foundations for classical plume theory, a theoretical description that is elegant in its simplicity and yet encapsulates the complex turbulent engulfment of ambient fluid into the plume. Testament to the insight and approach developed in these early models of plumes is that the essential theory remains unchanged and is widely applied today. We describe the foundations of plume theory and link the theoretical developments with the measurements made in experiments necessary to close these models before discussing some recent developments in plume theory, including an approach which generalizes results obtained separately for the Boussinesq and the non-Boussinesq plume cases. The theory presented\u2014despite its simplicity\u2014has been very successful at describing and explaining the behaviour of plumes across the wide range of scales they are observed. We present solutions to the coupled set of ordinary differential equations (the plume conservation equations) that Morton et al. (1956) derived from the Navier\u2013Stokes equations which govern fluid motion. In order to describe and contrast the bulk behaviour of rising plumes from general area sources, we present closed-form solutions to the plume conservation equations that were achieved by solving for the variation with height of Morton's non-dimensional flux parameter \u0393\u2014this single flux parameter gives a unique representation of the behaviour of steady plumes and enables a characterization of the different types of plume. We discuss advantages of solutions in this form before describing extensions to plume theory and suggesting directions for new research.","doi":"10.1093/imamat/hxq056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8145907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/imamat/hxq056","publicationTitle":"IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics","displayPublicationTitle":"IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016796/8145907/08145909.pdf","startPage":"424","endPage":"448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classical plume theory: 1937\u20132010 and beyond","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"Classical plume theory: 1937\u20132010 and beyond","volume":"76","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8145909/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classical plume theory: 1937\u20132010 and beyond","sourcePdf":"hxq056.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031129S","chronDate":"June  2011","isNumber":"8145907","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016796","articleId":"8145909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8145947,"authors":[{"name":"Kamyar Malakuti","firstName":"Kamyar","lastName":"Malakuti"},{"name":"Russel E.

For this purpose, we, first, propose an adaptive DVFS algorithm for energy efficient mono-core decoding of H.264 videos. The proposed solution uses metadata (normalized by MPEG) providing information about the upcoming workload. These metadata are processed within an adaptive filter to build dynamically an accurate complexity model used to calculate the minimal processor frequencies for decoding video frames while guaranteeing real time constraints. Then, we generalize the proposed DVFS to slice-based multi-threaded parallel video decoders on multi-core platforms. Our performance evaluations showed that the proposed algorithm for mono-core decoding is able to converge to an accurate complexity model (4 percent) in less than 1 second. Moreover, it is simple to implement, induces very low overhead and achieves up to 46 percent energy saving as compared to the ondemand Linux DVFS governor. On the other hand, joint use of parallelism and DVFS allows 720p software video decoding with only 17 percent more energy consumption as compared to a hardware video decoder.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2017.2779812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8314284","startPage":"858","endPage":"872","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/8314284/08148962.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2017.2779812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint DVFS and Parallelism for Energy Efficient and Low Latency Software Video Decoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Streaming media","Hardware","Complexity theory","Software","Transform coding","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","decoding","image filtering","Linux","multiprocessing systems","multi-threading","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low latency software video decoding","energy efficiency","hardware video decoders","adaptive DVFS algorithm","metadata","upcoming workload","adaptive filter","accurate complexity model","minimal processor frequencies","video frames","multithreaded parallel video decoders","multicore platforms","ondemand Linux DVFS governor","hardware video decoder","software video","energy efficient monocore decoding","energy consumption","joint DVFS and parallelism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DVFS","multi-core","video decoding","green metadata","energy efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"Joint DVFS and Parallelism for Energy Efficient and Low Latency Software Video Decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8148962/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2018","volume":"29","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8148962/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17633557","publicationDate":"1 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"BPI France, R\u00e9gion Ile-de-France"},{"fundingName":"R\u00e9gion Bretagne and Rennes M\u00e9tropole"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint DVFS and Parallelism for Energy Efficient and Low Latency Software Video Decoding","sourcePdf":"tpds-benmoussa-2779812-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149388S","chronDate":"April 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"8314284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8314284","articleId":"8148962","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8148963,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8271882/8148963/chen-2769339-small.gif","p":["Yu Chen (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2010, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, in 2012 and 2016, respectively.","He held several internships with the Bluetooth and Optical SerDes Groups, Broadcom, Irvine, CA, USA, and with the Microcontroller Unit Group, Silicon Labs, Austin, TX, USA.

We introduce a novel design method which enables the design of high-order IIR filters using only two tap delays. An event-grouping technique is also introduced to prevent parasitic oscillations in the presence of tap delay mismatches. The 1.2-V, 65-nm CMOS prototype implements a sixth-order IIR filter, with a maximum input rate of 20 Msample/s and a stop-band rejection of more than 80 dB. Without using any power-down circuitry, the chip's power consumption tracks the input activity in a fully agile manner, and varies by more than $50\\times $ , from 0.04 to 2.32 mW. The filter achieves an figure of merit (FoM) which competes with that of discrete-time (DT) filters, while avoiding the use of a clock and an antialiasing filter. Compared to prior art in CT digital signal processings, the prototype achieves 45-dB improvement in stop-band rejection and 9$\\times $ smaller delay line area. For the first time, the filtered CT digital signal is converted to synchronous mode at the end of signal chain, allowing integration with DT digital systems.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4/8271882/8148963-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8148963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17524271","htmlLink":"/document/8148963/","displayDocTitle":"A Continuous-Time Digital IIR Filter With Signal-Derived Timing and Fully Agile Power Consumption","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-0964606 and CCF-1419949"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Continuous-Time Digital IIR Filter With Signal-Derived Timing and Fully Agile Power Consumption","sourcePdf":"jssc-chen-2769339-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070912S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"8271882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8271882","articleId":"8148963","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8148964,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Wei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8271882/8148964/yhuan-2768412-small.gif","p":["Yi-Wei Huang (S\u201914) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1988.

We note that such a \u2018semiradiative\u2019 jet decelerates faster than an adiabatic jet does. We also take into account the effect of strong inverse-Compton scattering on the cooling frequency in the synchrotron component and therefore on the light-curve decay index. We find that there are two kinds of light-curve break for the jet effect. The first is an \u2018adiabatic break\u2019, if the electrons become slow-cooling before the jet enters a spreading phase, and the second is a \u2018radiative break\u2019, which appears in the contrary case. We then show how a relativistic jet evolves dynamically and derive the overall temporal synchrotron emission in both cases, focusing on the change in the light-curve decay index around the break time. Finally, in view of our results, we rule out two cases for relativistic jets which do not account for the observed light-curve breaks in a few afterglows: (i) an adiabatic jet with strong Compton cooling (Y > 1) and with the cooling frequency \u03bd\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> c</inf>\n locating in the observed energy range; (ii) a radiative jet with a significant fraction of total energy occupied by electrons (\u03f5\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> e</inf>\n \u223c 1).","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8149395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2002","volume":"330","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"March 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Overall temporal synchrotron emissions from relativistic jets: adiabatic and radiative breaks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overall temporal synchrotron emissions from relativistic jets: adiabatic and radiative breaks","sourcePdf":"3304955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066481S","chronDate":"March  2002","isNumber":"8149375","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016813","articleId":"8149395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8149446,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Ritchie","firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Ritchie"},{"name":"Luc Berthouze","firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Berthouze"},{"name":"Istvan Z.

Current algorithms lack control of key network parameters, the ability to specify to what subgraphs a node belongs to, come at a considerable complexity cost or, critically and sample from a limited ensemble of networks. To enable controlled investigations of the impact and role of subgraphs, especially for epidemics, neuronal activity or complex contagion, it is essential that the generation process be versatile and the generated networks as diverse as possible. In this article, we present two new network generation algorithms that use subgraphs as building blocks to construct networks preserving a given degree sequence. Additionally, these algorithms provide control over clustering both at node and global level. In both cases, we show that, despite being constrained by a degree sequence and global clustering, generated networks have markedly different topologies as evidenced by both subgraph prevalence and distribution around nodes, and large-scale network structure metrics such as path length and betweenness measures. Simulations of standard epidemic and complex contagion models on those networks reveal that degree distribution and global clustering do not always accurately predict the outcome of dynamical processes taking place on them. We conclude by discussing the benefits and limitations of both methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8149446/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","volume":"5","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Generation and analysis of networks with a prescribed degree sequence and subgraph family: higher-order structure matters","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Generation and analysis of networks with a prescribed degree sequence and subgraph family: higher-order structure matters","sourcePdf":"cnw011.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035494S","chronDate":"March  2017","isNumber":"8149439","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016804","articleId":"8149446","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"}]
