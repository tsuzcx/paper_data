In such environments, steering vector estimation errors are inevitable, leading to a degradation of the beamformer performance. Here, we study two types of beamformers that are robust against steering vector estimation errors. The first type includes robust Capon beamformers, where the underlying principle is to add a steering vector uncertainty constraint and/or a norm constraint to the optimization problem to improve the beamformer's robustness. The second type is the amplitude and phase estimation method, which utilizes both temporal and spatial smoothing. Experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance of the considered robust beamformers in acoustic environments. The results show that the robust beamformers outperform the non-robust beamformers in terms of predicted speech quality and intelligibility for different steering vector and covariance matrix estimation errors.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WASPAA.2017.8170000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169982","startPage":"86","endPage":"90","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125199/8169982/08170000.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental study of robust beamforming techniques for acoustic applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170000/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170000/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental study of robust beamforming techniques for acoustic applications","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417275","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental study of robust beamforming techniques for acoustic applications","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"0181570360696.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07153S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125199","isNumber":"8169982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125199","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8169982","articleId":"8170000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8170001,"authors":[{"name":"Sam Karimian-Azari","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Karimian-Azari","id":"37085391917"},{"name":"Tiago H.

Beamformers, however, have limits to reduce noise specially in the presence of reverberation. In this paper, we incorporate modulation properties of speech into a pre-processing algorithm to improve beamformer performance under combined noise-plus-reverberation conditions. In the modulation domain, signals are decomposed into modulators and carriers. Here, we propose to filter and perform short-time spectral subtraction of the modulator as a pre-processing step prior to beamforming, which in turn, is designed to align time differences between carriers of the array signal and to minimize the residual noise of the pre-processed signals. Simulation results with several noise-only and noise-plus-reverberation conditions show that the modulation pre-processing has improved the minimum power distortionless response beamformer by up to 7.4dB in the signal-to-noise ratio and 0.6 points in perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) score.","doi":"10.1109/WASPAA.2017.8170001","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125199/8169982/08170001.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WASPAA.2017.8170001","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","startPage":"91","endPage":"95","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation spectrum based beamforming for speech enhancement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Modulation spectrum based beamforming for speech enhancement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170001/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170001/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417301","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation spectrum based beamforming for speech enhancement","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"0191570360845.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105789S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125199","isNumber":"8169982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125199","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8169982","articleId":"8170001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170004,"authors":[{"name":"Hendrik Barfuss","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich - Alexander University Erlangen - N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Hendrik","lastName":"Barfuss","id":"37085497274"},{"name":"Markus Bachmann","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich - Alexander University Erlangen - N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Bachmann","id":"37086290126"},{"name":"Michael Buerger","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich - Alexander University Erlangen - N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Buerger","id":"37704303300"},{"name":"Martin Schneider","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich - Alexander University Erlangen - N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Schneider","id":"37708898100"},{"name":"Walter Kellermann","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich - Alexander University Erlangen - N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Kellermann","id":"37274601000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1632-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1631-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1633-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"}],"articleNumber":"8170004","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Robustness","Microphones","Array signal processing","Azimuth","Finite impulse response filters","Convex functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","humanoid robots","microphone arrays","optimisation","polynomials","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal-dependent measures","original fixed beamformer design","real-time data-independent beamforming","two-dimensional polynomial beamformers","convex optimization problem","robot audition","two-dimensional polynomial beamformer design method","data-independent robust beamformer","head-related transfer functions","signal-independent measures","steering vectors","twelve-element microphone array","humanoid robot"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Robust superdirective beamforming","polynomial beamforming","white noise gain","robot audition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170004","doi":"10.1109/WASPAA.2017.8170004","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","abstract":"We propose a robust two-dimensional polynomial beamformer design method, formulated as a convex optimization problem, which allows for flexible steering of a previously proposed data-independent robust beamformer in both azimuth and elevation direction.

The self-bending property of the beam is achieved by matching the phase profile that is applied to the array elements to a self-bending wave field. This process is termed phase engineering. It has been unclear how the optimal amplitude profile can be determined as the amplitude distribution of a self-bending wave field is difficult to determine. Previous works employed educated guesses. In this paper, we apply convex optimization to perform amplitude engineering. In other words, we complement phase engineering by determining the purely real amplitude weights that minimize the norm of the amplitude weights for a given maximum beam amplitude in the dark zone around which the beam bends. We show that phase engineering by itself does not narrow down the solution space sufficiently so that the choice of control points in the dark zone has a significant impact on how well the desired self-bending property forms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17417293","htmlLink":"/document/8170006/","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Amplitude engineering for beamformers with self-bending directivity based on convex optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude engineering for beamformers with self-bending directivity based on convex optimization","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"0241570357385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080336S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125199","isNumber":"8169982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125199","xplore-issue":"8169982","articleId":"8170006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8170010,"authors":[{"name":"Soumitro Chakrabarty","affiliation":["International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits (IIS), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Soumitro","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37085583786"},{"name":"Emanuel A.

An important variant is instrument-dependent music transcription where methods can use calibration data for the instruments in use. However, despite the additional information, results rarely exceed an f-measure of 80%. As a potential explanation, the transcription problem can be shown to be badly conditioned and thus relies on appropriate regularization. A recently proposed method employs a mixture of simple, convex regularizers (to stabilize the parameter estimation process) and more complex terms (to encourage more meaningful structure). In this paper, we present two extensions to this method. First, we integrate a computational loudness model to better differentiate real from spurious note detections. Second, we employ (Bidirectional) Long Short Term Memory networks to re-weight the likelihood of detected note constellations. Despite their simplicity, our two extensions lead to a drop of about 35% in note error rate compared to the state-of-the-art.","doi":"10.1109/WASPAA.2017.8170012","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125199/8169982/08170012.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"150","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WASPAA.2017.8170012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An augmented lagrangian method for piano transcription using equal loudness thresholding and lstm-based decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170012/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"An augmented lagrangian method for piano transcription using equal loudness thresholding and lstm-based decoding","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17417336","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170012/","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An augmented lagrangian method for piano transcription using equal loudness thresholding and lstm-based decoding","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"0301570360725.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069393S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125199","isNumber":"8169982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125199","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8169982","articleId":"8170012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8170018,"authors":[{"name":"Wenqiang Pu","affiliation":["National Lab of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China","Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Wenqiang","lastName":"Pu","id":"37085791604"},{"name":"Jinjun Xiao","affiliation":["Starkey Hearing Technologies, Eden Prairie, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Jinjun","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37086282030"},{"name":"Tao Zhang","affiliation":["Starkey Hearing Technologies, Eden Prairie, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37710818200"},{"name":"Zhi-Quan Luo","affiliation":["Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhi-Quan","lastName":"Luo","id":"37086082864"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1632-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1631-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1633-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"}],"articleNumber":"8170018","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphones","Hearing aids","Interference","Optimization","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","convex programming","handicapped aids","interference suppression","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ICMV","LCMV","ADMM","SOCP","degrees of freedom","alternating direction method of multipliers method","multiple interferences suppression","interfering sources","total interference power","spatial responses","linearly-constrained beamforming","hearing aids","penalized inequality","linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer","low complexity iterative algorithm","second-order cone programming","min-max beamformer design","array DoF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microphone array signal processing","acoustic beamforming","degrees of freedom","binaural hearing aids"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A penalized inequality-constrained minimum variance beamformer with applications in hearing aids","doi":"10.1109/WASPAA.2017.8170018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169982","endPage":"179","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125199/8169982/08170018.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WASPAA.2017.8170018","startPage":"175","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170018","abstract":"A well known challenge in linearly-constrained beamforming is how to suppress multiple interferences when the degrees of freedom (DoF) provided by the array are fewer than the number of sources in the environment. In this paper, we propose a beamformer design to address this challenge. Specifically, we propose a min-max beam-former design that penalizes the spatial responses on all interferences' directions. The new design can efficiently mitigate the total interference power regardless of whether the number of interfering sources is less than the array DoF or not. We formulate this min-max beamformer design as a convex second-order cone programming (SOCP) and proposed a low complexity iterative algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method to solve it. In the simulation, we compare the proposed beamfomer with the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer and a recently proposed inequality-constrained minimum variance (ICMV) beamformer [1].

For binaural hearing devices with one microphone per device, the noise power spectral density (PSD) is commonly estimated using various assumptions about the acoustic scenario. Since these methods lack robustness if the underlying assumptions are not satisfied, alternatively the noise PSD can be estimated at the output of a blocking matrix, however requiring an estimate of the relative transfer function (RTF) or direction of arrival (DOA) of the desired speech source. For constructing the blocking matrix, in this paper we exploit RTF estimates using the covariance whitening method and DOA estimates obtained from a binaural DOA estimator using anechoic prototype acoustic transfer functions (ATFs). Simulation results in a realistic cafeteria scenario show that exploiting DOA estimates for binaural noise PSD estimation leads to an improved noise reduction performance, especially in the presence of directional interfering speakers.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WASPAA.2017.8170030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169982","startPage":"234","endPage":"238","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125199/8169982/08170030.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise power spectral density estimation for binaural noise reduction exploiting direction of arrival estimates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170030/","displayDocTitle":"Noise power spectral density estimation for binaural noise reduction exploiting direction of arrival estimates","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417320","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise power spectral density estimation for binaural noise reduction exploiting direction of arrival estimates","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"0481570360794.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084452S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125199","isNumber":"8169982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125199","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8169982","articleId":"8170030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8170032,"authors":[{"name":"Dovid Y.

We consider applying the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer in a dynamic scenario, where the desired speaker, the noise components or microphone array may move. The generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC) structure offers a convenient implementation of the MVDR, allowing to track the noise efficiently. Yet, noise reduction is degraded during speech tracking. We propose a QR Decomposition (QRD) based MVDR beamformer, which allows to track both speech and noise variations in dynamic scenarios without sacrificing noise reduction during speech segments. The proposed method utilizes the QRD algorithm for the implementation of a complete system required for the realization of an MVDR beamformer, which includes the identification of noisy speech or noise-only time-frequency bins, speech tracking and noise tracking. The proposed QRD based MVDR is efficiently implemented, and its overall computational complexity is O(M\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n), with M being the number of microphones.

The encoder is a multi-layered, bi-directional gated recurrent unit (GRU) and the decoder a multi-layered GRU with a classification layer connected to the last GRU of the decoder. The classification layer and the alignment model are fully connected layers with shared weights between timesteps. The proposed method is evaluated using data drawn from a commercial sound effects library, ProSound Effects. The resulting captions were rated through metrics utilized in machine translation and image captioning fields. Results from metrics show that the proposed method can predict words appearing in the original caption, but not always correctly ordered.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170058/","accessionNumber":"17417341","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170058/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automated audio captioning with recurrent neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated audio captioning with recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"0761570356837.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050118S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125199","isNumber":"8169982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125199","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8169982","articleId":"8170058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":8170114,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge Echeverr\u00eda","affiliation":["Universidad San Jorge, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Echeverr\u00eda","id":"37086296676"},{"name":"Francisca P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Universidad San Jorge, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Francisca","lastName":"P\u00e9rez","id":"37086303468"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Panach","affiliation":["Universidad San Jorge, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9 Ignacio","lastName":"Panach","id":"38267342700"},{"name":"Carlos Cetina","affiliation":["Universitat de Valencia, Institution Avenida de la Universidad s/n, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Cetina","id":"37298504900"},{"name":"\u00d3scar Pastor","affiliation":["Camino de Vera sin, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"\u00d3scar","lastName":"Pastor","id":"37272341500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4039-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4040-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8170114","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"abstract":"Textual description of requirements is a specification technique that is widely used in industry, where time is key for success. How requirements are specified textually greatly depends on human factors. In order to study how requirements processing is affected by the level of detail in textual descriptions, this paper compares enriched textual requirements specifications with non-enriched ones. To do this, we have conducted an experiment in industry with 19 engineers of CAF (Construcciones y Auxiliares de Ferrocarril), which is a supplier of railway solutions. The experiment is a crossover design that analyzes efficiency, effectiveness, and perceived difficulty starting from a written specification of requirements that subjects must process in order to build software models. The results show that effectiveness and efficiency for enriched requirements are better, while non-enriched requirements are slightly more difficult to deal with. Therefore, even though enriched requirements require more time to be specified, the results are more successfully when using them.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169617/8169971/08170114.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"286","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM)","doi":"10.1109/ESEM.2017.41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESEM.2017.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169971","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Influence of Requirements in Software Model Development in an Industrial Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Companies","Natural languages","Interviews","Software measurement","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","human factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software model development","industrial environment","textual description","specification technique","human factors","requirements processing","textual requirements specifications","software models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software Requirements","Model-Based Software Development","Controlled Experiment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"The Influence of Requirements in Software Model Development in an Industrial Environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170114/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417945","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","conferenceDate":"9-10 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Influence of Requirements in Software Model Development in an Industrial Environment","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"4039a277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080593S","chronDate":"9-10 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169617","isNumber":"8169971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169617","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8169971","articleId":"8170114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170123,"authors":[{"name":"Kwabena Ebo Bennin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kwabena Ebo","lastName":"Bennin","id":"37085707205"},{"name":"Jacky Keung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jacky","lastName":"Keung","id":"37545406300"},{"name":"Akito Monden","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Japan"],"firstName":"Akito","lastName":"Monden","id":"37325963000"},{"name":"Passakorn Phannachitta","affiliation":["College of Arts, Media and Technology, Chiang Mai University, Thailand"],"firstName":"Passakorn","lastName":"Phannachitta","id":"38233044600"},{"name":"Solomon Mensah","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Solomon","lastName":"Mensah","id":"37086015776"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4039-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4040-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8170123","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"abstract":"Context: Recent studies have shown that performance of defect prediction models can be affected when data sampling approaches are applied to imbalanced training data for building defect prediction models. However, the magnitude (degree and power) of the effect of these sampling methods on the classification and prioritization performances of defect prediction models is still unknown. Goal: To investigate the statistical and practical significance of using resampled data for constructing defect prediction models. Method: We examine the practical effects of six data sampling methods on performances of five defect prediction models. The prediction performances of the models trained on default datasets (no sampling method) are compared with that of the models trained on resampled datasets (application of sampling methods). To decide whether the performance changes are significant or not, robust statistical tests are performed and effect sizes computed. Twenty releases of ten open source projects extracted from the PROMISE repository are considered and evaluated using the AUC, pd, pf and G-mean performance measures. Results: There are statistical significant differences and practical effects on the classification performance (pd, pf and G-mean) between models trained on resampled datasets and those trained on the default datasets. However, sampling methods have no statistical and practical effects on defect prioritization performance (AUC) with small or no effect values obtained from the models trained on the resampled datasets. Conclusions: Existing sampling methods can properly set the threshold between buggy and clean samples, while they cannot improve the prediction of defect-proneness itself. Sampling methods are highly recommended for defect classification purposes when all faulty modules are to be considered for testing.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Sampling methods","Data models","Software","Computational modeling","Robustness","Software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","sampling methods","software fault tolerance","software metrics","software quality","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data sampling approaches","software defect prioritization","imbalanced training data","building defect prediction models","prioritization performances","statistical significance","practical significance","data sampling methods","prediction performances","no sampling method","resampled datasets","pf","statistical effects","defect prioritization performance","defect classification purposes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Imbalanced data","Defect prediction","Sampling methods","Statistical significance","Empirical software engineering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ESEM.2017.50","publicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169617/8169971/08170123.pdf","startPage":"364","endPage":"373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169971","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESEM.2017.50","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Significant Effects of Data Sampling Approaches on Software Defect Prioritization and Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Significant Effects of Data Sampling Approaches on Software Defect Prioritization and Classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170123/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170123/","accessionNumber":"17417911","conferenceDate":"9-10 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Nov. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Significant Effects of Data Sampling Approaches on Software Defect Prioritization and Classification","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"4039a364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087695S","chronDate":"9-10 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169617","isNumber":"8169971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169617","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8169971","articleId":"8170123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8170205,"authors":[{"name":"Baochun He","affiliation":["Research Laboratory for Medical Imaging and Digital Surgery, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8170205/he-2781278-small.gif","p":["Baochun He was born in Shanxi, China, in 1991.

Due to the great variability in appearance among different boundaries of the prostate and among subjects, the traditional ASM is weak in MR image prostate segmentation. To address these limitations, we investigated a novel ASM-based method by incorporating deep feature learning into our previous liver segmentation framework. First, an adaptive feature learning probability boosting tree (AFL-PBT) based on both simple handcrafted features and deep learned features was developed for prostate pre-segmentation and for further shape model initialization. The proposed AFL-PBT classifier also provided a boundary searching band, which made the ASM less sensitive to model initialization. Then, the convolutional neutral network (CNN) deep learning method was used to train a boundary model, which separated voxels into three types: near, inside, and outside the boundary. A three-level ASM based on the CNN boundary model was employed for the final segmentation refinement. On MICCAI PROMISE12 test data sets, the proposed method yielded a mean Dice score of 84% with a standard deviation of 4%. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed other ASM-based prostate MRI segmentation methods and achieved a level of accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2781278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2781278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08170205.pdf","startPage":"2005","endPage":"2015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170205/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Magnetic Resonance Image Prostate Segmentation Based on Adaptive Feature Learning Probability Boosting Tree Initialization and CNN-ASM Refinement","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17573782","htmlLink":"/document/8170205/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2016YFC0106500/2, SQ2017ZY040217/03, NSFC-Guangdong Union10.13039/501100001809 and U1401254"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC-Shenzhen Union","grantNumber":"U1613221"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Scientific and Technology Program","grantNumber":"2015B020214005"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Key Basic Science Program","grantNumber":"JCYJ20170413162213765"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Automatic Magnetic Resonance Image Prostate Segmentation Based on Adaptive Feature Learning Probability Boosting Tree Initialization and CNN-ASM Refinement","sourcePdf":"access-jia-2781278-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061792S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8170205","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8170207,"authors":[{"name":"Shuming Qiu","affiliation":["School of CyberSpace Security, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Elementary Educational College, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8170207/qiu-2780124-small.gif","p":["Shuming Qiu received the M.S. degree from Jiangxi Normal University in 2009.

Along with such ease, it is essential to preserve the privacy and to provide the security to the patients/users in TMIS. Often, authentication protocols are adopted to guarantee privacy and secure interaction between the patients/users and remote server. Recently, Chaudhry et al. pointed out that Islam et al.'s scheme based on smart card is prone to user impersonation and server impersonation attacks. Chaudhry et al. later presented an enhanced scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography to remedy the weaknesses of Islam et al.'s scheme. Unfortunately, we find some important limitations in both schemes. We remark that their scheme is prone to off-line password guessing attack, user/server impersonation attack, and man-in-middle attack. To overcome these limitations, we present an improved authentication scheme keeping apart the threats encountered in the design of Chaudhry et al.'s scheme. Moreover, the presented scheme can also resist all known attacks. We prove the security of the proposed scheme with the help of widespread Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic. A brief comparison with the previous works provides that the presented protocol is more efficient and more secure than other related schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170207/","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8170207/","accessionNumber":"17612359","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Mutual Authentication Scheme Based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography for Telecare Medical Information Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Plan","grantNumber":"2017YFB0801901"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Robust Mutual Authentication Scheme Based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography for Telecare Medical Information Systems","sourcePdf":"access-qiu-2780124-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152186S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8170207","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8170212,"authors":[{"name":"Qitu Hu","affiliation":["Inner Mongolia Academy of Social Sciences, Hohhot, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8170212/hu-2781263-small.gif","p":["Qitu Hu is currently an Associate Researcher with the Inner Mongolia Academy of Social Sciences, China.

In this paper, we propose a multi-access edge computing framework and the corresponding communication protocol which integrates licensed Sub-6 GHz band, IEEE 802.11p, and millimeter wave (mmWave) communications for the content distribution and processing in vehicular networks. The proposed protocol uses a cluster-based approach, where a fuzzy logic-based algorithm is employed to select efficient gateway nodes which bridge the licensed Sub-6 GHz communication and the mmWave communication in order to maximize the overall network throughput. IEEE 802.11p vehicle-to-vehicle communication is used to share information among vehicles in order to achieve efficient clustering. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol under various network conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol can achieve significant improvements in various scenarios compared with the existing approaches.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170212","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Edge computing","Protocols","Computer architecture","Wireless communication","Bandwidth","Mobile communication","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","fuzzy logic","millimetre wave communication","mobile radio","multi-access systems","protocols","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content distribution","Sub-6 GHz communication","vehicular multiaccess edge computing","mobile edge computing architecture","dense vehicle environment","multiaccess edge computing framework","millimeter wave communications","vehicular Internet of Things","IEEE 802.11p","communication protocol","millimeter wave communications","cluster-based approach","fuzzy logic-based algorithm","gateway node selection","overall network throughput minimization","frequency 6.0 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-access edge computing","vehicular networks","mmWave","Sub-6 GHz band","IEEE 802.11p","fuzzy logic"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08170212.pdf","startPage":"1995","endPage":"2004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2781263","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2781263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicular Multi-Access Edge Computing With Licensed Sub-6 GHz, IEEE 802.11p and mmWave","topic":"Mobile Edge Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170212/","displayDocTitle":"Vehicular Multi-Access Edge Computing With Licensed Sub-6 GHz, IEEE 802.11p and mmWave","isDynamicHtml":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17542712","htmlLink":"/document/8170212/","volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61331013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002797","fundingName":"Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Mongolian Language Research","grantNumber":"MW-YB-2016025"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002797","fundingName":"Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Mongolian Language Information Special Support","grantNumber":"MW-2017-MGYWXXH-001"},{"fundingName":"JST Strategic International Collaborative Research Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007884","fundingName":"Hoso Bunka Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"16K00121"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Vehicular Multi-Access Edge Computing With Licensed Sub-6 GHz, IEEE 802.11p and mmWave","sourcePdf":"access-wu-2781263-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119488S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Mobile Edge Computing"],"articleId":"8170212","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8170213,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Li","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8170213/li-2780991-small.gif","p":["Hang Li received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Jilin University, Changchun, China.

By outsourcing network functions from dedicated hardware to virtualization platform, NFV promises to significantly improve the scalability and flexibility of network management and orchestration. One of the main challenges for NFV deployment is to realize coordinated service function chaining on NFV-based infrastructures. This challenge is referred to as the coordinated NFV resource allocation (coordinated NFV-RA) problem which is proved to be NP-hard. In order to response timely to the service variation, many heuristic or meta-heuristic algorithms are proposed to reduce the computing complexity. However, it is very difficult to evaluate the approach degree between obtained sub-optimal solutions and the optima, since finding the optimal solution is a non-trivial task. In this paper, a novel modeling approach called homogeneous link mapping is proposed to find the optimal solutions of a typical threestage coordinated NFV-RA model with CPLEX. Then we further establish a service function chain (SFC) deployment database with optimal solutions and the results in the database can be used as a criterion to evaluate other SFC algorithms. In order to imitate different practical networks, the SFC deployments are conducted on three type network topologies. And we also analyze the SFC deploying performance on different topologies. At Last, we make the optimal modeling approach open source, and upload the database on http: //www.opensource5g.org/database.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780991","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08170213.pdf","startPage":"17595","endPage":"17605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructing Service Function Chain Test Database: An Optimal Modeling Approach for Coordinated Resource Allocation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170213/","displayDocTitle":"Constructing Service Function Chain Test Database: An Optimal Modeling Approach for Coordinated Resource Allocation","volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17712810","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170213/","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission Research","grantNumber":"Z16111000500000 and Z171100000317003"},{"fundingName":"China Ministry of Education-CMCC research","grantNumber":"MCM20160104"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Constructing Service Function Chain Test Database: An Optimal Modeling Approach for Coordinated Resource Allocation","sourcePdf":"access-li-2780991-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117267S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8170213","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8170223,"authors":[{"name":"Jinn-Tsong Tsai","affiliation":["National Pingtung University, Pingtung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8999828/8170223/tsai-2776158-small.gif","p":["Jinn-Tsong Tsai received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical and electro-mechanical engineering from the National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 1986 and 1988, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering science and technology from the National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, in 2004.","He is currently a Professor with the Department of Computer Science, National Pingtung University, Pingtung, Taiwan.

The SL-PSO is used not only to find the best membership function types, but also to optimize the premise and consequent parameters for ANFIS. The important process parameters for CMP-CF included the initial time, polishing time, polishing pad weight (down force), slurry chemicals, and rotation speed. The output targets were red pixels, green pixels, blue pixels, and the surface roughness. First, the performance of the SL-PSO was tested with 18 continuous global numerical optimization problems, including six unimodal functions, seven multimodal functions, and five complex rotated and shifted functions. Nonparametric Wilcoxon tests were also used in multiple-problem analysis for simultaneous comparison of various algorithms over a problem set. The computational experiments showed that the proposed SL-PSO approach outperforms PSO-based methods reported in the literature. Finally, the proposed SL-PSO method was used to optimize CMP-CF parameters. The experimental results showed that the ANFIS with SL-PSO outperforms the conventional ANFIS method and conventional back propagation neural network in terms of prediction accuracy. A practical industrial application in a CF manufacturer showed that the ANFIS with SL-PSO obtained superior results compared to the previous method and immediately enhanced production efficiency. Together, these experimental results indicate that the proposed ANFIS with SL-PSO is a reliable method for optimizing CMP-CF processes.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2017.2776158","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/8999828/08170223.pdf","startPage":"1193","endPage":"1207","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2017.2776158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8999828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color Filter Polishing Optimization Using ANFIS With Sliding-Level Particle Swarm Optimizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Color Filter Polishing Optimization Using ANFIS With Sliding-Level Particle Swarm Optimizer","volume":"50","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2020","accessionNumber":"19377940","publicationDate":"March 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8170223/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 105-2218-E-151-001, MOST 105-2221-E-153-005 and MOST 106-2221-E-153-005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color Filter Polishing Optimization Using ANFIS With Sliding-Level Particle Swarm Optimizer","sourcePdf":"tsmc-chou-2776158-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170878S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8999828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8999828","articleId":"8170223","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8170228,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Shirazi","affiliation":["Antenna, RF, and Microwave Integrated System Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Shirazi","orcid":"0000-0003-1613-4831","id":"37085361966"},{"name":"Junyi Huang","affiliation":["Antenna, RF, and Microwave Integrated System Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Junyi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086212908"},{"name":"Tianjiao Li","affiliation":["Antenna, RF, and Microwave Integrated System Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Tianjiao","lastName":"Li","id":"37085368416"},{"name":"Xun Gong","affiliation":["Antenna, RF, and Microwave Integrated System Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Gong","orcid":"0000-0001-7111-736X","id":"37280987600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"8170228","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7063},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170228","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Slot antennas","Antenna measurements","PIN photodiodes","Switches","Aperture antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aperture antennas","microwave antennas","p-i-n diodes","slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switchable-frequency slot-ring antenna element","reconfigurable array","L-band slot-ring antenna","p-i-n diode switches","C-band operating states","antenna element spacing","shared-aperture antenna","frequency bands","frequency-reconfigurable slot-ring antenna switching","C-band slot-ring antenna array","frequency 5.71 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna arrays","reconfigurable antennas","shared-aperture antennas","slot antennas","switchable-frequency antennas"]}],"abstract":"A frequency-reconfigurable slot-ring antenna switching between L- and C-bands is presented.

In the DDSR, the analog components are used to their maximum potential as each stage participates in amplification, blocker filtering, anti-aliasing, and quantization noise shaping simultaneously, resulting in a compact design. To overcome the increased design complexity, the implemented DDSRs rely on common practices in receiver and \u0394\u03a3 modulator design. In this paper, we will show that the common design practices for neither receivers nor \u0394\u03a3 modulators yield optimal performance for the DDSR, and propose a systematic design method for gmC based DDSRs. The method enables improved performance and a straight-forward design flow by combining the gain partitioning, noise considerations, and loop-filter design. The developed method is demonstrated by designing a gmC based DDSR using a 28nm FDSOI CMOS process. Simulations of the DDSR indicate state-of-the-art performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170240/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","volume":"65","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"17895192","dateOfInsertion":"03 July 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8170240/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Systematic Design Method for Direct Delta-Sigma Receivers","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Systematic Design Method for Direct Delta-Sigma Receivers","sourcePdf":"tcsi-englund-2777895-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108607S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8402068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8402068","articleId":"8170240","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8170242,"authors":[{"name":"A\u00efcha Bentaieb","affiliation":["Medical Image Analysis Lab, School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"A\u00efcha","lastName":"Bentaieb","orcid":"0000-0002-7899-3327","id":"37085787908"},{"name":"Ghassan Hamarneh","affiliation":["Medical Image Analysis Lab, School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Ghassan","lastName":"Hamarneh","orcid":"0000-0001-5040-7448","id":"37294023500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"8170242","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2162},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Image analysis","Cancer","Image segmentation","Analytical models","Gray-scale"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomedical optical imaging","cancer","feature extraction","image classification","image colour analysis","image segmentation","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adversarial stain transfer","color information","visual analysis","histopathology tissue slides","automatic histopathology image analysis algorithms","digitized histopathology images","color variation","stain-related tissue inconsistencies","automatic image analysis systems","color statistics","color matching","discriminative image analysis model","stain normalization component","set-specific staining properties","image-specific color transformations","task-specific network","tissue segmentation","normalized images","tissue components","tissue classification","tissue feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Histopathology","stain normalization","generative learning","adversarial training"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Histocytochemistry","Humans","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Machine Learning","Neoplasms","Staining and Labeling"]}],"abstract":"It is generally recognized that color information is central to the automatic and visual analysis of histopathology tissue slides. In practice, pathologists rely on color, which reflects the presence of specific tissue components, to establish a diagnosis. Similarly, automatic histopathology image analysis algorithms rely on color or intensity measures to extract tissue features. With the increasing access to digitized histopathology images, color variation and its implications have become a critical issue. These variations are the result of not only a variety of factors involved in the preparation of tissue slides but also in the digitization process itself. Consequently, different strategies have been proposed to alleviate stain-related tissue inconsistencies in automatic image analysis systems. Such techniques generally rely on collecting color statistics to perform color matching across images. In this work, we propose a different approach for stain normalization that we refer to as stain transfer. We design a discriminative image analysis model equipped with a stain normalization component that transfers stains across datasets. Our model comprises a generative network that learns data set-specific staining properties and image-specific color transformations as well as a task-specific network (e.g., classifier or segmentation network). The model is trained end-to-end using a multi-objective cost function. We evaluate the proposed approach in the context of automatic histopathology image analysis on three data sets and two different analysis tasks: tissue segmentation and classification. The proposed method achieves superior results in terms of accuracy and quality of normalized images compared to various baselines.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2017.2781228","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/8305569/08170242.pdf","startPage":"792","endPage":"802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2017.2781228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8305569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adversarial Stain Transfer for Histopathology Image Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170242/","displayDocTitle":"Adversarial Stain Transfer for Histopathology Image Analysis","volume":"37","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17599820","pubMedId":"29533895","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170242/","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007065","fundingName":"NVIDIA Corporation for GPU donation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adversarial Stain Transfer for Histopathology Image Analysis","sourcePdf":"tmi-bentaieb-2781228-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072159S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"8305569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8305569","articleId":"8170242","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8170244,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The new decoder, denoted as ultra-light decoder (ULD), can perform soft-decision decoding without an algebraic hard decision decoder, which is the core of conventional soft-decision decoders of block codes. Moreover, the unique structure of the ULD enables the design of a new approach to compute the minimum Euclidean distance at each decoding iteration. Therefore, the ULD offers significant complexity and delay reduction as compared with the conventional TPC decoders. Reducing the complexity and delay will enable using codes with high code rates to improve the system spectral efficiency or use powerful codes with low code rates to reduce the transmission power. The system bit-error rate is presented for binary and M-ary modulation schemes over additive white Gaussian noise channels, and the coding gain is given for Rayleigh fading channels. The obtained numerical results show that the ULD offers coding gain that is comparable to the conventional TPC decoders under various system and channel conditions but with significantly lower complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170244/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","volume":"22","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"17614429","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8170244/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-Light Decoder for Turbo Product Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-Light Decoder for Turbo Product Codes","sourcePdf":"lcomm-aldweik-2781223-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0694S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8309483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8309483","articleId":"8170244","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8170250,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Orlandi","affiliation":["UAq\u2009 EMC Laboratory, Department of Industrial and Information Engineering and Economics, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Orlandi","orcid":"0000-0001-5301-2820","id":"37269551000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9375"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-187X"}],"articleNumber":"8170250","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":409},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/emcs/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170250","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2017.2778001","endPage":"1013","startPage":"1010","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel7/15/8264903/08170250.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2017.2778001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8264903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Retraction: Electromagnetic Time Reversal Approach to Locate Multiple Soft Faults","abstract":"Retracted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","xploreNote":"Notice of Retraction: After careful consideration, this article has been retracted due to irregularities in the peer review process.","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170250/","volume":"60","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"17490198","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Retraction: Electromagnetic Time Reversal Approach to Locate Multiple Soft Faults","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Notice of Retraction: Electromagnetic Time Reversal Approach to Locate Multiple Soft Faults","sourcePdf":"temc-orlandi-2778001-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024542S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","isNumber":"8264903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","articleId":"8170250","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8170252,"authors":[{"name":"Giampaolo Buticchi","affiliation":["Power Electronics, Machines and Control Group, University of Nottingham Ningbo China, Ningbo, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8400452/8170252/butic-2781258-small.gif","p":["Giampaolo Buticchi (S\u201910\u2013M\u201913\u2013SM\u201917)\n received the Master's degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D degree in information technologies, both from\n the University of Parma, Parma, Italy, in 2009 and 2013, respectively.","In 2012, he was a Visiting Researcher with the University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K. During 2014\u20132017, he\n was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.

In this framework, the electrical power distribution system (EPDS) is of high importance. In order to improve the utilization of the generators and face the peak power demand without disconnecting the loads, different technologies of storage are employed. This paper proposes the use of a quadruple active bridge converter, already employed in other fields, to interface a fuel cell, a battery, and a supercapacitor bank to the dc bus of the EPDS. This objective can be achieved by employing multiple dc/dc converters, which allow an individual control of the energy sources and a good efficiency. Obtaining the same power control and efficiency with a multiport power converter constitutes a challenge that is worth taking to reduce cost, volume, and weight and increase the system reliability. A novel control based on proportional integral (PI) controllers in conjunction with a decoupling system and current feedforward allow shaping the power request to each port. This, however, leads to an asymmetrical loading of each port, which could decrease the efficiency. A laboratory prototype is used to confirm that this asymmetrical kind of operation, where each port processes a different amount of power, does not imply a marked reduction of efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8400452/08170252.pdf","startPage":"8174","endPage":"8186","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2781258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2781258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8400452","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Quadruple Active Bridge Converter for the Storage Integration on the More Electric Aircraft","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Aircraft","Aerospace electronics","Mathematical model","Fuel cells","Batteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","aircraft power systems","DC-DC power convertors","feedforward","power control","power convertors","power generation control","PWM power convertors","supercapacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadruple active bridge converter","storage integration","Electric Aircraft concepts","electric systems","aircrafts","electrical power distribution system","EPDS","peak power demand","dc bus","multiple dc/dc converters","power control","multiport power converter","system reliability","proportional integral controllers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC-DC power converters","energy storage","pulse width modulation converters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Quadruple Active Bridge Converter for the Storage Integration on the More Electric Aircraft","volume":"33","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8170252/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"17877401","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Unions Seventh Framework Program (FP/2007-2013)/ERC","grantNumber":"616344-HEART"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Quadruple Active Bridge Converter for the Storage Integration on the More Electric Aircraft","sourcePdf":"tpel-buticchi-2781258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070093S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8400452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8400452","articleId":"8170252","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8170254,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/8186262/8170254/zhang-2778598-small.gif","p":["Chuan Zhang (S\u201907\u2013M\u201913) received the B.E. degree in microelectronics and the M.E. degree in VLSI design from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the M.S.E.E. degree and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities (UMN), USA, in 2012.

In database-driven cognitive radio, PUs and SUs must provide their locations to enable dynamic channel allocation, which raises location privacy breach concern. Previous studies only focus on unilateral privacy preservation, i.e., only PUs' or SUs' privacy is preserved. In this paper, we propose to protect bilateral location privacy of PUs and SUs. The main challenge lies in how to coordinate PUs and SUs to maximize their utilities provided that their location privacy is protected. We first introduce a quantitative method to calculate both PUs' and SUs' location privacy, and then design a novel privacy preserving Utility Maximization protocol (UMax). UMax allows for both PUs and SUs to adjust their privacy preserving levels and optimize transmit power iteratively to achieve the maximum utilities. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our proposed protocol can efficiently increase the utilities of both PUs and SUs while preserving their location privacy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April 1 2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170266/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","volume":"17","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"19583450","publicationDate":"1 March-April 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8170266/","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2020","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bilateral Privacy-Preserving Utility Maximization Protocol in Database-Driven Cognitive Radio Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61731004"},{"fundingName":"ZJU-SUTD","grantNumber":"188170-11102/012"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20171264"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bilateral Privacy-Preserving Utility Maximization Protocol in Database-Driven Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tdsc-he-2781248-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.221712S","chronDate":"March-April 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"9034462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"9034462","articleId":"8170266","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8170272,"authors":[{"name":"Sai Sudheer Reddy Bonthu","affiliation":["Cincinnati Incorporated, Harrison, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/8440861/8170272/bonth-2781259-small.gif","p":["Sai Sudheer Reddy Bonthu (S\u201913\u2013M\u201917) received the\n B.Tech. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from GITAM University, Visakhapatnam, India, in 2012, the\n M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from The University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA, in May 2015, and the\n Master's degrees in electrical engineering and engineering management from The University of Akron.

Several design techniques including optimal slot/pole combination, stator slot and rotor magnet skewing, and shape optimization of rotor flux barriers have been studied intensively to reduce the torque pulsations in the internal rotor reluctance motors. However, internal rotor reluctance motors involve power train complexity and space constraints in the traction application. On the other hand, outer rotor motors can be designed optimally to eliminate these drawbacks and in addition, produce higher power density. In such outer rotor reluctance motor designs, torque ripple plays crucial role as the in-wheel motor is under duress of consistent rotational forces. Furthermore, optimization of outer rotor in-wheel motors needs to be thoroughly investigated to reduce the torque ripple and to generate higher torque density. In this paper, a rotor shape optimization based on design of notches and rotor flux barrier is presented. Detailed optimization process in adjunct to analytical and simulation results comparison is presented. Finally, optimal designs are fabricated and tests are conducted on the 3.7-kW prototypes to validate the proposed design-optimization theory.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Torque Ripple Reduction Technique for Outer Rotor Permanent Magnet Synchronous Reluctance Motors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2017.2781259","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel7/60/8440861/08170272.pdf","startPage":"1184","endPage":"1192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2017.2781259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8440861","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170272/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Torque Ripple Reduction Technique for Outer Rotor Permanent Magnet Synchronous Reluctance Motors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8170272/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18043061","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps)","grantNumber":"1518968 and TEC-00479-2017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Torque Ripple Reduction Technique for Outer Rotor Permanent Magnet Synchronous Reluctance Motors","sourcePdf":"tec-choi-2781259-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101262S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"8440861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8440861","articleId":"8170272","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":8170283,"authors":[{"name":"Rifaqat Hussain","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, King Fahd University for Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Rifaqat","lastName":"Hussain","orcid":"0000-0003-4665-0095","id":"38282017500"},{"name":"Mohammad S.

In this paper, we address the problem of not only detecting the anomalous events but also of attributing the anomaly to the flows causing it. To this end, we develop a new statistical decision theoretic framework for temporally correlated traffic in networks via Markov chain modeling. We first formulate the optimal anomaly detection problem via the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) for our composite model. This results in a combinatorial optimization problem which is prohibitively expensive. We then develop two low-complexity anomaly detection algorithms. The first is based on the cross entropy (CE) method, which detects anomalies as well as attributes anomalies to flows. The second algorithm performs anomaly detection via GLRT on the aggregated flows transformation - a compact low-dimensional representation of the raw traffic flows. The two algorithms complement each other and allow the network operator to first activate the flow aggregation algorithm in order to quickly detect anomalies in the system. Once an anomaly has been detected, the operator can further investigate which specific flows are anomalous by running the CE-based algorithm. We perform extensive performance evaluations and experiment our algorithms on synthetic and semi-synthetic data, as well as on real Internet traffic data obtained from the MAWI archive, and finally make recommendations regarding their usability.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2017.2765719","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/8291715/08170290.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2017.2765719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8291715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection and Attribution in Networks With Temporally Correlated Traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170290/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection and Attribution in Networks With Temporally Correlated Traffic","volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17578197","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170290/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"Singapore National Research Foundation","grantNumber":"NRF2014NCR-NCR001-034"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection and Attribution in Networks With Temporally Correlated Traffic","sourcePdf":"tnet-divakaran-2765719-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104454S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"8291715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8291715","articleId":"8170290","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8170291,"authors":[{"name":"Sung In Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Daegu University, Gyeongsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/8386723/8170291/cho-2781371-small.gif","p":["Sung In Cho (S\u201910\u2013M\u201917) received the B.S. degree in\n electronic engineering from Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and\n computer engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea, in 2015.

The proposed method consists of the following four procedures: element-weight determination, geodesic path-based kernel (GPK) generation, single-pass smoothing using the GPK, and post-processing of the GPK smoothing. In the first procedure, weights for neighboring pixels are calculated by diffusivity analysis. In the second procedure, a geodesic path is selected using a geodesic distance that is calculated by a diffusion continuity analysis. In the third procedure, GPK-based smoothing is applied to a given noisy image to extract the noise-free pixel value. Finally, a distant AD that uses the double diffusion length is applied to the resultant image by the GPK filtering to enhance the quality of noise suppression in smooth regions. In addition to the main procedures, schemes for the robust outlier reduction and complexity reduction are introduced. The simulation results showed that the proposed method improved the denoising quality by increasing the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) by up to 4.094 dB and 0.057, respectively, compared to the AD-based benchmark methods. Compared to block-matching and 3-D filtering, the proposed method showed comparable quality of noise reduction with similar PSNR and SSIM values, which it accomplished with much less computation time.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2017.2781371","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/8386723/08170291.pdf","startPage":"1738","endPage":"1750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2017.2781371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8386723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geodesic Path-Based Diffusion Acceleration for Image Denoising","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170291/","displayDocTitle":"Geodesic Path-Based Diffusion Acceleration for Image Denoising","volume":"20","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17840190","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170291/","dateOfInsertion":"15 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geodesic Path-Based Diffusion Acceleration for Image Denoising","sourcePdf":"tmm-kang-2781371-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0942S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"8386723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8386723","articleId":"8170291","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8170296,"authors":[{"name":"Yuke Li","affiliation":["School of Computer and Control Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8375923/8170296/li-2781251-small.gif","p":["Yuke Li (S\u201916) received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2014.

The mission-critical smart grid communications require secure and reliable connections between the utilities and the devices with high quality of service (QoS). This is difficult to achieve for unlicensed LPWAN technologies due to the crowded license free band. Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), as a licensed LPWAN technology, is developed based on the existing long-term evolution specifications and facilities. Thus, it is able to provide cellular-level QoS, and henceforth can be viewed as a promising candidate for smart grid communications. In this paper, we introduce NB-IoT to the smart grid and compare it with the existing representative communication technologies in the context of smart grid communications in terms of data rate, latency, range, etc. The overall requirements of communications in the smart grid from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives are comprehensively investigated and each of them is carefully examined for NB-IoT. We further explore the representative applications in the smart grid and analyze the corresponding feasibility of NB-IoT. Moreover, the performance of NB-IoT in typical scenarios of the smart grid communication environments, such as urban and rural areas, is carefully evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2781251","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things

A microwave photonic bandpass filter (MP-BPF) is used to transmit the VPN signal without electrical conversion. The DBA is implemented by adjusting a free spectral range of the MP-BPF with corresponding subcarrier allocation. A RF clipping-tone (CT) is used to stabilize the optical channel suffered from phase induced-intensity noise and Rayleigh back-scattering noise. The DBA is experimentally verified at different two DBA scenarios in 20-km single-fiber loopback link in terms of channel error vector magnitude, spectral efficiency after adaptive modulation. Due to the CT-based channel stabilization, achievable spectral efficiency could be improved, and the feasibility of the proposed system is successfully demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2780198","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/8233353/08170302.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2780198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave Photonic Filter Based All-Optical Virtual Private Network Supporting Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation in OFDMA-PON System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170302/","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Photonic Filter Based All-Optical Virtual Private Network Supporting Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation in OFDMA-PON System","volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17481862","isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"7900208","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170302/","impactStatement":"A novel all-optical virtual private network (VPN) in multi-carrier access based passive optical network (PON) is proposed with the experimental demonstration.

Whereas well-studied greedy and iterative threshold-based CS recursions take the form of an adaptive filter followed by a proximal operator, this is no different in spirit from the role of block iterative equalizers, where structure is roughly exploited by the signal constellation slicer. By capitalizing on the intrinsic sparsity of signal modulations, we approach the concept of interblock interference (IBI) more proficiently in light of CS concepts, where the optimal feedback of detected symbols is devised adaptively. This should be contrasted with standard forms of IBI estimation/cancellation commonly seen in block DFEs, where detection is restricted to a contiguous set of entries within the transmitted vector. A significant consequence of the latter is that, while block transceivers commonly employ some form of redundancy that accounts for IBI, a CS algorithm applied to the same transmitted vector may require no redundancy whatsoever, and is capable of retrieving both target symbol and IBI altogether. The CS-based iterative DFE acts as a more efficient re-estimation procedure, proposed under recursive-least-squares based adaptations. Besides maximizing system throughput, the new algorithms exhibit significantly higher performance when compared to existing methods that focus solely on minimized redundancy. Simulations in several scenarios illustrate the merits of the unified approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8259460/08170307.pdf","startPage":"1007","endPage":"1022","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2781648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2781648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8259460","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compressed Sensing Approach to Block-Iterative Equalizers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Redundancy","Decision feedback equalizers","Signal processing algorithms","Transceivers","Compressed sensing","Interference","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","compressed sensing","interference suppression","iterative methods","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block-iterative equalizers","data sparsity","greedy threshold","iterative threshold","adaptive filter","proximal operator","signal constellation slicer","signal modulations","interblock interference","optimal feedback","IBI estimation/cancellation","block transceivers","recursive-least-squares based adaptations","compressed sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","fast algorithms","block DFE","RLS","redundancy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170307/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15, 15 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Compressed Sensing Approach to Block-Iterative Equalizers","volume":"66","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8170307/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Feb.15, 2018","accessionNumber":"17535317","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compressed Sensing Approach to Block-Iterative Equalizers","sourcePdf":"tsp-merched-2781648-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093894S","chronDate":"Feb.15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8259460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8259460","articleId":"8170307","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8170308,"authors":[{"name":"Junwei Han","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China","School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/8246756/8170308/han-2781424-small.gif","p":["Junwei Han is currently a Full Professor with Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China.

During the past few years, object co-segmentation has received great attention in the computer vision community. However, the existing approaches are usually designed with misleading assumptions, unscalable priors, or subjective computational models, which do not have sufficient robustness for dealing with complex and unconstrained real-world image contents. This paper proposes a novel two-stage co-segmentation framework, mainly for addressing the robustness issue. In the proposed framework, we first introduce the concept of union background and use it to improve the robustness for suppressing the image backgrounds contained by the given image groups. Then, we also weaken the requirement for the strong prior knowledge by using the background prior instead. This can improve the robustness when scaling up for the unconstrained image contents. Based on the weak background prior, we propose a novel MR-SGS model, i.e., manifold ranking with the self-learned graph structure, which can infer suitable graph structures in a data-driven manner rather than building the fixed graph structure relying on the subjective design. Such capacity is critical for further improving the robustness in inferring the foreground/background probability of each image pixel. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with other state-of-the-art approaches can demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed work.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8246756/08170308.pdf","startPage":"1639","endPage":"1651","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2781424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2781424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8246756","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Object Co-Segmentation Using Background Prior","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Image segmentation","Feature extraction","Image color analysis","Training","Computational modeling","Object segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","graph theory","image resolution","image segmentation","inference mechanisms","learning (artificial intelligence)","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subjective design","image pixel","Robust Object Co-Segmentation","computer vision community","subjective computational models","robustness issue","strong prior knowledge","unconstrained image contents","MR-SGS model","self-learned graph structure","unconstrained real-world image contents","two-stage co-segmentation framework","union background concept","image background suppression","image groups","weak background prior","foreground-background probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Object co-segmentation","background prior","self-learned graph","manifold ranking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Robust Object Co-Segmentation Using Background Prior","volume":"27","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8170308/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17485816","pubMedId":"29324417","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473231"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Object Co-Segmentation Using Background Prior","sourcePdf":"tip-han-2781424-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120612S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8246756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"8246756","articleId":"8170308","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8170316,"authors":[{"name":"Danish Rafique","affiliation":["ADVA Optical Networking, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Danish Rafique received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees all in\n electrical engineering.

In existing microgrid configurations, the PV units are controlled using droop control technique, which ensures load sharing among the distributed generation (DG) inverters. However, the intermittency in power generation of PV-based DG poses many challenges to the standalone operation of a microgrid, the ineffective volt-ampere (VA) utilization being one among them. This paper proposes an adaptive droop control, which enables the maximum utilization of the VA rating of the interfacing inverter in a PV/battery hybrid system. With the proposed technique, as the generation goes down, the DG inverter is controlled to support the reactive power demand of the load, thereby utilizing the rating of the inverter switches effectively. The applicability of the proposed adaptive control method is analyzed using detailed simulation and real-time hardware-in-loop studies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Batteries","Microgrids","Reactive power","Voltage control","Power generation","Power system management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","distributed power generation","invertors","photovoltaic power systems","power generation control","reactive power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive power management strategy","photovoltaic generation unit","standalone microgrid","microgrid configurations","PV units","distributed generation inverters","power generation","standalone operation","adaptive droop control","PV/battery hybrid system","DG inverter","reactive power demand","adaptive control method","volt-ampere utilization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","droop control","intermittent power generation","islanding","microgrid"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIA.2017.2781643","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/8319543/08170322.pdf","startPage":"1784","endPage":"1792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8319543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2017.2781643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Power Management Strategy for Effective Volt\u2013Ampere Utilization of a Photovoltaic Generation Unit in Standalone Microgrids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Power Management Strategy for Effective Volt\u2013Ampere Utilization of a Photovoltaic Generation Unit in Standalone Microgrids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170322/","volume":"54","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8170322/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17633310","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Power Management Strategy for Effective Volt\u2013Ampere Utilization of a Photovoltaic Generation Unit in Standalone Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tia-khadkikar-2781643-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107188S","chronDate":"March-April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"8319543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8319543","articleId":"8170322","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8170326,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Shen","affiliation":["Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center on Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing, China","Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7274860/9113128/8170326/shen-2781232-small.gif","p":["Jian Shen received the ME and PhD degrees in computer science from Chosun University, South Korea, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

Since CSPs are not fully trusted, it is essential to protect the integrity and confidentiality of users' data. Plenty of researchers have devoted considerable attention to solve this issue in the last decade such as various PDP and POR schemes. In this paper, we propose an algebraic signature-based data integrity auditing scheme that ensures the cloud data integrity and confidentiality with batch auditing. Moreover, one advantage of the scheme is that it can also support data dynamics by using only one cloud server. The security analysis shows that our construction can achieve the desired security properties. We also provide the simulation results of the dynamic operations on different numbers of data blocks and sub-blocks, which show that our scheme is efficient for real-world applications.","doi":"10.1109/TSUSC.2017.2781232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274860/9113128/08170326.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSUSC.2017.2781232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9113128","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algebraic Signatures-Based Data Integrity Auditing for Efficient Data Dynamics in Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170326/","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic Signatures-Based Data Integrity Auditing for Efficient Data Dynamics in Cloud Computing","volume":"5","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8170326/","publicationDate":"1 April-June 2020","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2020","accessionNumber":"19673169","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501333, 61672295, 61672290, 61772280 and U1405254"},{"fundingName":"Key Laboratory of Information Security","grantNumber":"2017-MS-10"},{"fundingName":"2015 Project of six personnel in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"R2015L06"},{"fundingName":"CICAEET fund"},{"fundingName":"PAPD fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic Signatures-Based Data Integrity Auditing for Efficient Data Dynamics in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tsusc-shen-2781232-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151659S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"7274860","isNumber":"9113128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7274860","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"9113128","articleId":"8170326","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8170328,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8309484/8170328/lu-2779857-small.gif","p":["Xiao Lu received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, and the M.Eng. degree in computer engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

However, wireless-powered communications rely on active RF signals to communicate and result in high power consumption. On the other hand, ambient backscatter technology that passively reflects existing RF signal sources in the air to communicate has the potential to facilitate an implementation with ultra-low power consumption. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid device-to-device (D2D) communication paradigm by integrating ambient backscattering with wireless-powered communications. The hybrid D2D communications are self-sustainable, as no dedicated external power supply is required. However, since the radio signals for energy harvesting and for backscattering come from the ambient, the performance of the hybrid D2D communications depends largely on environment factors, e.g., distribution, spatial density, and transmission load of ambient energy sources. Therefore, we design two mode selection protocols for the hybrid D2D transmitter, allowing a more flexible adaptation to the environment. We then introduce analytical models to characterize the impacts of the considered environment factors on the hybrid D2D communication performance. Together with extensive simulations, our analysis shows that the communication performance benefits from larger repulsion, transmission load, and density of ambient energy sources. Furthermore, we investigate how different mode selection mechanisms affect the communication performance.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2779857","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8309484/08170328.pdf","startPage":"1528","endPage":"1544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8309484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2779857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless-Powered Device-to-Device Communications With Ambient Backscattering: Performance Modeling and Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170328","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/8309484/8170328-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Wireless-Powered Device-to-Device Communications With Ambient Backscattering: Performance Modeling and Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170328/","publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17617697","htmlLink":"/document/8170328/","volume":"17","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea Grant through the Korean Government","grantNumber":"2014R1A5A1011478"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingName":"Singapore MOE Tier 2","grantNumber":"MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC4/15 and NRF2015-NRF-ISF001-2277"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-1717454, CNS-1731424, CNS-1702850, CNS-1646607, ECCS-1547201, CMMI-1434789, CNS-1443917 and ECCS-1405121"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Wireless-Powered Device-to-Device Communications With Ambient Backscattering: Performance Modeling and Analysis","sourcePdf":"twc-kim-2779857-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142251S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8309484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"8309484","articleId":"8170328","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8170329,"authors":[{"name":"Oluwakayode Onireti","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8357823/8170329/onire-2775520-small.gif","p":["Oluwakayode Onireti (S\u201911\u2013M\u201913) received the B.Eng.\n (Hons.) degree in electrical engineering from the University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria, in 2005, and the M.Sc.\n (Hons.) degree in mobile and satellite communications, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from the\n University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K., in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

By using a distance-dependent line-of-sight (LOS) probability function, the location of LOS and nonLOS users are modeled as two independent nonhomogeneous Poisson point processes, with each having a different pathloss exponent. The analysis takes account of per-user fractional power control (FPC), which couples the transmission of users based on location-dependent channel inversion. We consider the following scenarios in our analysis:1) pathloss-based FPC (PL-FPC) which is performed using the measured pathloss and 2) distance-based FPC (D-FPC) which is performed using the measured distance. Using the developed framework, we derive expressions for the area spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. Results suggest that in terms of SINR coverage, D-FPC outperforms PL-FPC scheme at high SINR where the future networks are expected to operate. It achieves equal or better area spectral efficiency and energy efficiency compared with the PL-FPC scheme. Contrary to the conventional ultra-high frequency cellular networks, in both FPC schemes, the SINR coverage decreases as the cell density becomes greater than a threshold, while the area spectral efficiency experiences a slow growth region.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2775520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8357823/08170329.pdf","startPage":"3982","endPage":"3997","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2775520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8357823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coverage, Capacity, and Energy Efficiency Analysis in the Uplink of mmWave Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170329","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/25/8357823/8170329-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170329/","displayDocTitle":"Coverage, Capacity, and Energy Efficiency Analysis in the Uplink of mmWave Cellular Networks","volume":"67","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"17752971","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170329/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council U.K. Global Challenges Research Fund Allocation","grantNumber":"EP/P028764/1"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1730650, 1718956 and 1559483"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Coverage, Capacity, and Energy Efficiency Analysis in the Uplink of mmWave Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-onireti-2775520-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.185186S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8357823","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8357823","articleId":"8170329","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8170330,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos I.

In particular, the secondary transmitter operates in a spatial multiplexing transmission mode, while a zero-forcing detector is employed at the secondary receiver. Additionally, the secondary system is interfered by multiple randomly distributed single-antenna primary users (PUs). To enhance the performance of secondary transmission, optimal power allocation is performed at the secondary transmitter with a constraint on the interference temperature (IT) specified by the PUs. The outage probability of the secondary receiver is explicitly derived in an exact closed-form expression. Also, some special cases of practical interest, including colocated PUs and massive MIMO, are discussed. Further, to mitigate instantaneous excessive interference onto PUs caused by the time-average IT, an iterative antenna reduction algorithm is developed for the secondary transmitter and, accordingly, the average number of transmit antennas is analytically computed. Extensive numerical and simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of our analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2781466","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8338166/08170330.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2781466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338166","startPage":"3349","endPage":"3360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation and Active Interference Mitigation for Spatial Multiplexed MIMO Cognitive Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation and Active Interference Mitigation for Spatial Multiplexed MIMO Cognitive Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170330/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699018","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8170330/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"161gzd03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Allocation and Active Interference Mitigation for Spatial Multiplexed MIMO Cognitive Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-miridakis-2781466-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119014S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8170330","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8170332,"authors":[{"name":"Jingjing Cui","affiliation":["Institute of Mobile Communications, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8309484/8170332/cui-2779504-small.gif","p":["Jingjing Cui (S\u201914) received the B.S. degrees in communication engineering from Tibet University, Lhasa, China, in 2012.

Random beamforming is invoked for reducing the feedback overhead of the considered system. A non-convex optimization problem for maximizing the sum rate is formulated, which is proved to be NP-hard. The branch and bound approach is invoked to obtain the $\\epsilon$ -optimal power allocation policy, which is proved to converge to a global optimal solution. To elaborate further, a low-complexity suboptimal approach is developed for striking a good computational complexity-optimality tradeoff, where the matching theory and successive convex approximation techniques are invoked for tackling the user scheduling and power allocation problems, respectively. Simulation results reveal that: 1) the proposed low complexity solution achieves a near-optimal performance and 2) the proposed mm-Wave NOMA system is capable of outperforming conventional mm-Wave orthogonal multiple access systems in terms of sum rate and the number of served users.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2779504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8309484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2779504","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8309484/08170332.pdf","startPage":"1502","endPage":"1517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal User Scheduling and Power Allocation for Millimeter Wave NOMA Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimal User Scheduling and Power Allocation for Millimeter Wave NOMA Systems","volume":"17","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170332/","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17617707","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170332/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61731017"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"111-2-14"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/L025272/1"},{"fundingName":"H2020-MSCA-RISE-2015","grantNumber":"690750"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal User Scheduling and Power Allocation for Millimeter Wave NOMA Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-liu-2779504-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.182366S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8309484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"8309484","articleId":"8170332","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8170354,"authors":[{"name":"Marcel Admiraal","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"Admiraal","id":"37086293251"},{"name":"Samuel Wilson","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Wilson","id":"37086290129"},{"name":"Ravi Vaidyanathan","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Ravi","lastName":"Vaidyanathan","id":"37275720900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6064-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6065-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8170354","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":516},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170354","abstract":"Wearable motion tracking systems are becoming increasingly popular in human-machine interfaces. For inertial measurement, it is vital to efficiently fuse inertial, gyroscopic, and magnetometer data for spatial orientation. We introduce a new algorithm for this fusion based on using gradient descent to correct for the integral error in calculating the orientation quaternion of a rotating body. The algorithm is an improved formulation of the well-known estimation of orientation using a gradient descent algorithm. The new formulation ensures that the gradient descent algorithm uses the steepest descent, resulting in a five order of magnitude increase in the precision of the calculated orientation quaternion. We have also converted the algorithm to use fixed point integers instead of floating point numbers to more than double the speed of the calculations on the types of processors used with Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and Magnetic, Angular Rate and Gravity sensors (MARGs). This enables the corrections to not only be faster than the original formulations, but also remain valid for a larger range of inputs. The improved efficiency and accuracy show significant potential for increasing the scope of inertial measurement in applications where low power or greater precision is necessary such as very small wearable or implantable systems.","doi":"10.1109/MFI.2017.8170354","startPage":"403","endPage":"410","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8124739/8170342/08170354.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MFI.2017.8170354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved formulation of the IMU and MARG orientation gradient descent algorithm for motion tracking in human-machine interfaces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quaternions","Angular velocity","Rotation measurement","Tracking","Magnetometers","Gravity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","estimation theory","gradient methods","gyroscopes","human computer interaction","inertial navigation","Kalman filters","magnetometers","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steepest descent","calculated orientation quaternion","improved efficiency","human-machine interfaces","wearable motion tracking systems","spatial orientation","inertial measurement units","magnetometer data","IMU","MARG orientation gradient descent algorithm","gyroscopic data","inertial data","magnetic angular rate and gravity sensors","implantable systems","wearable systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Improved formulation of the IMU and MARG orientation gradient descent algorithm for motion tracking in human-machine interfaces","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170354/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","conferenceDate":"16-18 Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417230","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved formulation of the IMU and MARG orientation gradient descent algorithm for motion tracking in human-machine interfaces","confLoc":"Daegu, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"F1B4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068765S","chronDate":"16-18 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8124739","isNumber":"8170342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8124739","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8170342","articleId":"8170354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8170360,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Masoum","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Twente, Enschede, AE, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Masoum","id":"38265350200"},{"name":"Nirvana Meratnia","affiliation":["Universiteit Twente, Enschede, Overijssel, NL"],"firstName":"Nirvana","lastName":"Meratnia"},{"name":"Paul J.

In this paper, we introduce a distributed compressive sensing approach, which utilizes spatial correlation among sensor nodes to group them into coalitions. The coalition formation method is represented by a block diagonal measurement matrix whose each diagonal entity corresponds to one of the coalitions. Then, a spatial-temporal correlation-based compressive sensing approach is used inside each coalition to schedule sensor nodes and encode their readings. Distributed data encoding over coalitions increases robustness and scalability of the approach. Simulation results verify that the proposed solution outperforms other compressive sensing approaches significantly in terms of data accuracy and energy efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8124739/8170342/08170360.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"447","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","doi":"10.1109/MFI.2017.8170360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MFI.2017.8170360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing based data collection in wireless sensor networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Correlation","Energy measurement","Base stations","Energy consumption","Sensors","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robustness","block diagonal measurement matrix","energy efficiency","data accuracy","scalability","distributed data","spatial-temporal correlation","coalition formation method","sensor nodes","spatial correlation","distributed compressive sensing approach","energy-efficient data","signal processing","wireless sensor networks","compressive sensing based data collection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing based data collection in wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170360/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417194","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","conferenceDate":"16-18 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing based data collection in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Daegu, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"F2A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067084S","chronDate":"16-18 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8124739","isNumber":"8170342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8124739","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170342","articleId":"8170360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170407,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Aimed at improving SWaP-constrained robotic state estimation, we present Multi-Hypothesis DeepEfference (MHDE) - an unsupervised, deep convolutional-deconvolutional sensor fusion network that learns to intelligently combine noisy heterogeneous sensor data to predict several probable hypotheses for the dense, pixel-level correspondence between a source image and an unseen target image. This new multi-hypothesis formulation of our previous architecture, DeepEfference [1], has been augmented to handle dynamic heteroscedastic sensor and motion noise and computes hypothesis image mappings and predictions at 150-400 Hz depending on the number of hypotheses being generated. MHDE fuses noisy, heterogeneous sensory inputs using two parallel architectural pathways and n (1, 2, 4, or 8 in this work) multi-hypothesis generation subpathways to generate n pixel-level predictions and correspondences between source and target images. We evaluated MHDE on the KITTI Odometry dataset [2] and benchmarked it against DeepEfference [1] and DeepMatching [3] by mean pixel error and runtime. MHDE with 8 hypotheses outperformed DeepEfference in root mean squared (RMSE) pixel error by 103% in the maximum heteroscedastic noise condition and by 18% in the noise-free condition. MHDE with 8 hypotheses was over 5, 000% faster than DeepMatching with only a 3% increase in RMSE.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170407/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417170","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A deep neural network approach to fusing vision and heteroscedastic motion estimates for low-SWaP robotic applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A deep neural network approach to fusing vision and heteroscedastic motion estimates for low-SWaP robotic applications","confLoc":"Daegu, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"T1C1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095606S","chronDate":"16-18 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8124739","isNumber":"8170342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8124739","xplore-issue":"8170342","articleId":"8170407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170416,"authors":[{"name":"Wenhao Luo","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Wenhao","lastName":"Luo","id":"37085748889"},{"name":"Changjoo Nam","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Changjoo","lastName":"Nam","id":"37086294341"},{"name":"Katia Sycara","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Katia","lastName":"Sycara","id":"37268476900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6064-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6065-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8170416","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"abstract":"We consider the problem of online robotic sampling in environmental monitoring tasks where the goal is to collect k best samples from n sequentially occurring measurements.

The general linear model (GLM), which is a standard method for fMRI imaging, has been applied for fNIRS imaging analysis. However, when the subject moves, the fNIRS signal can contain artifacts during the measurement. These artifacts are called motion artifacts. However, the GLM has a drawback of failure because of motion artifacts. Recently, wavelet and hemodynamic response function based algorithms are popular detrending methods of motion artifact correction for fNIRS signals. However, these methods cannot show impressive performance in harsh environments such as overground walking tasks. This paper suggests a new motion artifact correction method that uses an entropy based unbalanced optode decision rule and a wavelet regression based back propagation neural network.

However, there are limitations such as spatial constraints, occlusions in images, sensor unreliability, and the inconvenience of users. In order to solve these problems we suggest a sensor fusion method for human action recognition exploiting RGB images from a single fixed camera and a single wrist mounted inertial sensor. These two different domain information can complement each other to fill the deficiencies that exist in both image based and inertial sensor based human action recognition methods. We propose two convolutional neural network (CNN) based feature extraction networks for image and inertial sensor data and a recurrent neural network (RNN) based classification network with long short term memory (LSTM) units. Training of deep neural networks and testing are done with synchronized images and sensor data collected from five individuals. The proposed method results in better performance compared to single sensor-based methods with an accuracy of 86.9% in cross-validation. We also verify that the proposed algorithm robustly classifies the target action when there are failures in detecting body joints from images.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8124739/8170342/08170441.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-modal human action recognition using deep neural networks fusing image and inertial sensor data","doi":"10.1109/MFI.2017.8170441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MFI.2017.8170441","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multi-modal human action recognition using deep neural networks fusing image and inertial sensor data","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417172","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170441/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-modal human action recognition using deep neural networks fusing image and inertial sensor data","confLoc":"Daegu, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"T4BP1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063809S","chronDate":"16-18 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8124739","isNumber":"8170342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8124739","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8170342","articleId":"8170441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170480,"authors":[{"name":"Monidipa Das","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/8170468/8170480/das-2760202-small.gif","p":["Monidipa Das (S\u201914) received the M.E. degree in computer\n science and engineering from the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, India, in 2013.

The situation becomes more serious during multitemporal analysis when data at various a-periodic timestamps are missing. In this work, we have proposed a deep-learning-based framework (Deep-STEP_FE) for reconstructing the missing data to facilitate analysis with remote sensing time series. The idea is to utilize the available data from both earlier and subsequent timestamps, while maintaining the causality constraint in spatiotemporal analysis. The framework is based on an ensemble of multiple forecasting modules, built upon the observed data in the time-series sequence. The coupling between the forecasting modules is accomplished with the help of dummy data, initially predicted using the earlier part of the sequence. Then, the dummy data are progressively improved in an iterative manner so that it can best conform to the next part of the sequence. Each of the forecasting modules in the ensemble is based on Deep-STEP, a variant of the deep stacking network learning approach. The work has been validated using a case study on predicting the missing images in normalized difference vegetation index time series, derived from Landsat-7 TM-5 satellite imagery over two spatial zones in India. Comparative performance analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed forecasting ensemble.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170480/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17397912","volume":"10","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Deep-Learning-Based Forecasting Ensemble to Predict Missing Data for Remote Sensing Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deep-Learning-Based Forecasting Ensemble to Predict Missing Data for Remote Sensing Analysis","sourcePdf":"jstars-das-2760202-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062997S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"8170468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8170468","articleId":"8170480","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8170563,"authors":[{"name":"Liqi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Liqi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085665901"},{"name":"Kai Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Tan","id":"37085382271"},{"name":"Xiaoqing Song","affiliation":["ABB USCRC, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoqing","lastName":"Song","id":"37085435897"},{"name":"Alex Q.

Neural networks (NN) were successful used for solving complicated issues due to their capacity of generalization and learning from examples. In this paper some aspects of image compression using artificial neural networks are discussed. The network is used in the feedback loop of the visual servoing system, which aims to control a wheeled mobile robot equipped with a robotic manipulator. Hence, grayscale images are used. The goal is to find a low-complexity feed-forward neural network (FFNN) model for image compression, with good compression rate, but with small errors between original image and the reconstructed one. The model is validated using the invariant moments of the image. Different FFNN architectures, with different data sets and training conditions, are analyzed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170627/","accessionNumber":"17417532","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170627/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Aspects of image compression using neural networks for visual servoing in robot control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aspects of image compression using neural networks for visual servoing in robot control","confLoc":"Galati, Romania","sourcePdf":"ISEEE2017paper106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045308S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125502","isNumber":"8170622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125502","xplore-issue":"8170622","articleId":"8170627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8170657,"authors":[{"name":"Cristina Nichiforov","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Nichiforov","id":"37086254231"},{"name":"Iulia Stamatescu","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Iulia","lastName":"Stamatescu","id":"37085403466"},{"name":"Ioana F\u0103g\u0103r\u0103\u015fan","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Ioana","lastName":"F\u0103g\u0103r\u0103\u015fan","id":"37547863900"},{"name":"Grigore Stamatescu","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Grigore","lastName":"Stamatescu","id":"37396572700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2059-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2058-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2060-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8170657","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":805},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170657","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Mathematical model","Energy consumption","Data models","Monitoring","Time series analysis","Forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive moving average processes","decision making","decision support systems","energy consumption","load forecasting","neural nets","power engineering computing","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption forecast","autoregressive integrated moving average model","ARIMA","nonlinear autoregressive neural network model","energy consumption forecasting","electricity consumption","decision support systems","decision making process","energy system","energy consumption time series prediction problems","predictive modelling problem","NAR","complex linear patterns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["forecasting","energy consumption","artificial neural networks","arima","time series"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISEEE.2017.8170657","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125502/8170622/08170657.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 5th International Symposium on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ISEEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 5th International Symposium on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ISEEE)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEEE.2017.8170657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy consumption forecasting using ARIMA and neural network models","abstract":"Energy forecast is essential for a good planning of the electricity consumption as well as for the implementation of decision support systems which can lead the decision making process of energy system.

As a main contribution, this work proposes an intelligent algorithm derived from PSO. This algorithm has two main characteristics. The first one consists in the use of an improved version of PSO, namely Hybrid Topology Particle Swarm Optimization (HTPSO). The second characteristic is related to the kind of solved problems. The algorithm is devoted to the optimal control problems, even those who handle bilocal constraints concerning the state variables. In order to prove its efficiency, the HTPSO algorithm was tested on many optimal control problems.

In real conditions, constraints related to signal's transmitting/receiving (such as the transducers configuration or the experimental setup) can affect the informational content of the signal. Thus, the received signals need content reconstruction before the parameters estimation (generally based on matched filtering). In the current study, we are interested to improve such waves TOF estimation between two transducers (a transmitter and a receiver) that are not perfectly aligned, due either to the initial experimental setup or to the vibrations in operational conditions. The misalignments of transmitter-receiver transducers introduce interferences since the propagation environment will have several propagation dispersive paths in terms of the received signals. This multipath propagation environment will conduct to interferences and, then, to the partial samples loss. In order to recover the missing samples, the proposed signal reconstruction method uses firstly a time axis (warping) transformation of the signal. The aim of time axis transformation is to turn any non-linear frequency modulation into a stationary signal in the warped domain. In this transformed domain, the CS concept is used to recover the missing spectral components. Then, an unwrapping function enables to express the recovered signal into the original time domain. We prove that the matched filter-based acoustic wave TOF estimation from the reconstructed signal is more accurate than using the original received signal.","doi":"10.1109/ISEEE.2017.8170703","publicationTitle":"2017 5th International Symposium on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ISEEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 5th International Symposium on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ISEEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125502/8170622/08170703.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEEE.2017.8170703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170622","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time of flight estimation in multi-path dispersive configuration using compressive sensing reconstruction in the warped domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time of flight estimation in multi-path dispersive configuration using compressive sensing reconstruction in the warped domain","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170703/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417514","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170703/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time of flight estimation in multi-path dispersive configuration using compressive sensing reconstruction in the warped domain","confLoc":"Galati, Romania","sourcePdf":"ISEEE2017paper92.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04764S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125502","isNumber":"8170622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125502","xplore-issue":"8170622","articleId":"8170703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170720,"authors":[{"name":"\u00c7a\u011fr\u0131 G\u00f6ken","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey","ASELSAN Inc., Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u00c7a\u011fr\u0131","lastName":"G\u00f6ken","id":"37587049600"},{"name":"Onur Dizdar","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey","ASELSAN Inc., Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"Dizdar","id":"38266703700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0595-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"8170720","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error statistics","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge windowing","nonlinear power amplifier effects","windowing technique","window lengths","edge subcarriers","OFDM signals","block error rate performance","conventional windowing","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals","cyclic prefix","nonlinear power amplifier PA effects","out-of-band emission characteristics","OOB emission characteristics","average error vector magnitude","EVM","coded block error rate","intersymbol interference","intercarrier interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","5G","windowing","power amplifier models"]}],"abstract":"Edge windowing is a windowing technique for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals based on the idea of using shorter cyclic prefix (CP) and longer window lengths at the edge subcarriers while keeping the symbol length fixed.

Relaying has been introduced as a solution to enable communication between users who suffer from poor channel conditions. Distributed relay networks are a special case where spatial diversity is obtained by using a relay consisting of many geographically dispersed nodes. Due to bandwidth constraints, distributed relay networks perform quantization at the relay nodes, and hence they are referred to as quantized distributed relay networks. In such systems, users transmit data simultaneously through the uplink to the relay nodes of the relay. Each node independently quantizes the observed signal to a few bits and broadcasts these bits through the band-limited downlink channel to the users. In this paper, we consider a multi-way quantized distributed relay network where the relay facilitates the communication between many users. For decoding purposes, we develop algorithms that can be employed by the users to estimate their uplink channels as well as the uplink channels observed by all other users when nodes perform simple sign quantization. A near maximum likelihood (nearML) channel estimator is derived. In addition, other sub-optimal estimators that are more computationally efficient than the nearML technique are also presented. Via simulation, we compare the performance of the proposed channel estimators.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170735.pdf","endPage":"347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation for multi-way quantized distributed wireless relaying","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170735","startPage":"342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation for multi-way quantized distributed wireless relaying","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170735/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17417395","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170735/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation for multi-way quantized distributed wireless relaying","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p342ibrahim.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073015S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8170739,"authors":[{"name":"O.

A key factor to implement the MU-MIMO system is the CSI feedback mechanism. However, it might be exploited by malicious attackers to threaten the transmission security of benign clients. To better explore the attacks through false CSI feedback in MU-MIMO systems, this paper proposes a mathematically formulated strategy of eavesdropping attack, called polynomial attack. Based on the basic polynomial attack strategy, we investigate two kinds of advanced polynomial attacks: the passive polynomial attack and the active polynomial attack. They are discriminated by the different abilities in approaching to the eavesdropped victims. Besides proving the attack effects theoretically, we also develop defensive methods against the two attacks. Especially against the active attack, we propose a novel MU-MIMO scheme called AntiPoly, under which each client holds a pair of constant keys. One is the feedback key used for interacting with the AP in the CSI training period, and the other one is the transmission key used for decoding signals in the transmission period. With intensive experiments performed on actual measured CSI, the attack effects of polynomial attacks are illustrated, and our developed defensive methods are validated.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170740.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"45","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170740","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On eavesdropping attacks and countermeasures for MU-MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Array signal processing","Antennas","Receivers","Computer security","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eavesdropping attacks","MU-MIMO system","CSI feedback mechanism","malicious attackers","false CSI feedback","basic polynomial attack strategy","advanced polynomial attacks","passive polynomial attack","active polynomial attack","attack effects","active attack","novel MU-MIMO scheme","MU-MIMO beamforming","multiple antennas","multiple receivers","transmission security","AntiPoly"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170740/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"On eavesdropping attacks and countermeasures for MU-MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170740/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417377","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On eavesdropping attacks and countermeasures for MU-MIMO systems","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p40wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087101S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170743,"authors":[{"name":"Adrien Le Naour","affiliation":["Thales Communications & Security, France"],"firstName":"Adrien","lastName":"Le Naour","id":"37086295999"},{"name":"Elie Janin","affiliation":["Thales Communications & Security, France"],"firstName":"Elie","lastName":"Janin","id":"37086299128"},{"name":"Charly Poulliat","affiliation":["University of Toulouse, ENSEEIHT/IRIT, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Charly","lastName":"Poulliat","id":"37269105300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0595-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"8170743","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170743","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Iterative decoding","Complexity theory","Receivers","Convolutional codes","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel coding","computational complexity","concatenated codes","continuous phase modulation","convolutional codes","decoding","error statistics","iterative decoding","modulation coding","parity check codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coded continuous phase modulations","narrowband waveforms","noniterative solutions","robust data rates","short codeword lengths","serially concatenated convolutional code","continuous phase modulation","CC-CPM schemes","channel coding strategies","serially concatenated CPM scheme","optimized LDPC scheme","iterative detection","optimal performance","P-CPM","precoded CPM schemes","iterative decoding","bit error rate simulations","versatile modern channel codes","turbo codes","reliable alternative NBWF scheme","LDPC accumulate repeat jagged accumulate","additive white Gaussian noise","optimized low-density parity check code","pragmatic CPM"]}],"abstract":"NarrowBand Waveforms (NBWF) are often used in VHF or UHF tactical communications. For these kinds of waveforms, low latency and robust data rates result in short codeword lengths that are challenging in terms of channel coding. Usually, serially concatenated convolutional code and continuous phase modulation (CC-CPM) schemes are considered in the context of NBWF. When evaluating the achievable rates, CC-CPM schemes show a 1 to 4 dB maximum margin. In this paper, we investigate on two new sparse graph-based channel coding strategies, trying to reduce this degradation for the achievable rate. Some implementation issues with short codeword lengths are also addressed. To this end, we first consider a serially concatenated CPM scheme where the outer code is an optimized Low-Density Parity-Check code (LDPC) based on some recently introduced methods for this kind of applications. The optimized LDPC scheme exhibits a good bit error rate when binary CPMs are used. This new design comes with lower computational complexity and greater flexibility. Second, in order to avoid the cubersome of iterative detection and decoding, we investigate on recently introduced precoded CPM that can achieve near optimal performance, referred to us as Pragmatic CPM (P-CPM). For this kind of precoded CPM schemes, we will show that associated EXIT chart curves have the flat property. It means that, to achieve good performance, P-CPM can be used with standard capacity approaching codes like LDPC Accumulate Repeat Jagged Accumulate (ARJA) or Turbo Codes without the need for iterative decoding. Bit error rate simulations confirm that P-CPM is a reliable alternative NBWF scheme compatible with versatile modern channel codes. As P-CPM is non-iterative, implementation is made easier. In additive white Gaussian noise, both schemes are found practical.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170743","startPage":"489","endPage":"494","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170743.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New perspectives for coded continuous phase modulations for narrowband waveforms: Iterative versus non-iterative solutions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170743/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"New perspectives for coded continuous phase modulations for narrowband waveforms: Iterative versus non-iterative solutions","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17417347","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170743/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New perspectives for coded continuous phase modulations for narrowband waveforms: Iterative versus non-iterative solutions","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p489lenaour.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078018S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8170745,"authors":[{"name":"Yuyu Ma","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Distributed Computing and Service (BUPT), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuyu","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086287788"},{"name":"Hui Gao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Distributed Computing and Service (BUPT), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Gao","id":"37403296700"},{"name":"Tiejun Lv","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Distributed Computing and Service (BUPT), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tiejun","lastName":"Lv","id":"37267189000"},{"name":"Yueming Lu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Distributed Computing and Service (BUPT), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yueming","lastName":"Lu","id":"37292927900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0595-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"8170745","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":456},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Interference","Clustering algorithms","Correlation","Downlink","Resource management","Fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","fading channels","radiofrequency interference","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conventional user scheduling","SDA framework","signal strength difference","minimal inter-cluster interference leakage","downlink NOMA system","downlink nonorthogonal multiple access system","K single antenna user equipments","signal difference","alignment framework","fair user","spectral efficient user","flexible performance-complexity tradeoff","signal space alignment","system overhead","downlink zero-forcing beamforming vector","user clustering schemes","N-antenna base station","LSF gains","complementary UEs","large-scale fading","LSF","sorted UE set"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose novel user clustering schemes for downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, where an N-antenna base station (BS) selects and serves 2N users from K single antenna user equipments (UEs) (K \u2265 2N and K is even). In particular, we propose a signal difference and alignment (SDA) framework to achieve fair and spectral efficient user clustering for NOMA with flexible performance-complexity tradeoff. To be more specific, the BS sorts UEs according to their large-scale fading (LSF) gains and selects N primary UEs with the highest LSF gains to guide the downlink zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) vector. Then the BS selects N complementary UEs from the second half of the sorted UE set based on the principle of signal space alignment (SSA). Unlike conventional user scheduling, SDA framework uses the ordered set to create signal strength difference for NOMA while employing opportunistic SSA method to select complementary UEs with minimal inter-cluster interference leakage. Moreover, the SDA framework can enable distributed implementation with graceful performance at lower system overhead. Numerical results verify that the proposed schemes improve the performance in downlink NOMA system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel user clustering schemes for downlink NOMA system","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170745","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170745.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Novel user clustering schemes for downlink NOMA system","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170745/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417410","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel user clustering schemes for downlink NOMA system","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p191ma.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081222S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170746,"authors":[{"name":"Romain Chayot","affiliation":["T\u00e9SA/IRIT/University of Toulouse"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Chayot","id":"37086172283"},{"name":"Nathalie Thomas","affiliation":["ENSEEIHT/IRIT/University of Toulouse"],"firstName":"Nathalie","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37687019400"},{"name":"Charly Poulliat","affiliation":["ENSEEIHT/IRIT/University of Toulouse"],"firstName":"Charly","lastName":"Poulliat","id":"37269105300"},{"name":"Marie-Laure Boucheret","affiliation":["ENSEEIHT/IRIT/University of Toulouse"],"firstName":"Marie-Laure","lastName":"Boucheret","id":"38491572500"},{"name":"Nicolas Van Wambeke","affiliation":["Thales Alenia Space"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Van Wambeke","id":"37660461100"},{"name":"Guy Lesthievent","affiliation":["Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales"],"firstName":"Guy","lastName":"Lesthievent","id":"37298214900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0595-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"8170746","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Channel estimation","Frequency-domain analysis","Delays","Detectors","Satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","continuous phase modulation","equalisers","error statistics","least squares approximations","satellite links","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalization","CPM","satellite link","generalized polyphase representation","frequency-selective channels","improved LS estimation","aeronautical communications","least squares channel estimation","Continuous Phase Modulation signals","bit error rate","BER"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a generalized polyphase representation for Continuous Phase Modulation (CPM) signals suited to the detection over frequency-selective channels.

This work examines a statistical ensemble (mean-valued) of average beampattern behavior for canonical and non-canonical volumetrically bound distributed (random) antenna arrays. Cubical, cylindrical, and spherical topologies of isotropic elements are analyzed to show beamforming and scanning from zenith to meridian for canonical topologies. In addition, small amounts of work have previously been investigated and therefore this work helps to enlighten with illustrations of the beampattern phenomena of a select few non-conically bound distributed and volumetric structures. To validate the distributed array pattern behavior, the manifold is composed of one million isotropic radiators densely populated amongst geometrical bounds to examine characteristic pattern behavior. This provides faithful convergence of numerical beampatterns to their expected (mean) patterns. Last of all, results show an increasing complexity of pattern behavior for use in many spatial advancements in distributed beamforming.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","startPage":"817","endPage":"822","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170756.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of beamforming patterns from volumetrically distributed phased arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170756/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of beamforming patterns from volumetrically distributed phased arrays","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417380","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of beamforming patterns from volumetrically distributed phased arrays","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p817overturf.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059831S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8170757,"authors":[{"name":"Steven McElwee","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computing Engineering, Nova Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, FL"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"McElwee","id":"37085819217"},{"name":"Jeffrey Heaton","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computing Engineering, Nova Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, FL"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Heaton","id":"37085780505"},{"name":"James Fraley","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computing Engineering, Nova Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, FL"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Fraley","id":"37085774769"},{"name":"James Cannady","affiliation":["Georgia Tech Research Institute, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Cannady","id":"37281953700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0595-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"8170757","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1190},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170757","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Prototypes","Neural networks","Pipelines","User interfaces","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intrusion detection alerts","network intrusion detection systems","security alerts","cyber defense security analysts","Federated Analysis Security Triage Tool prototype","TensorFlow deep neural network classifier","cyber defense analysts","security alert reviews","Department of Defense cyber defense security analysts","analyst queries","analyst response","computer network cyberattack detection","deep learning","machine learning","Elasticsearch","Kibana","FASTT","threat intelligence reporting","STIX/TAXII format","Indications of Compromise","US Government"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intrusion defense","security analysis","deep learning","neural network"]}],"abstract":"Network intrusion detection systems are widely deployed to detect cyberattacks against computer networks. These systems generate large numbers of security alerts that require manual review by security analysts to determine the appropriate courses of action required. The review of these security alerts is time consuming and can cause fatigue for security analysts, especially during long work shifts. This paper reviews a case study of the application of machine learning to the initial triage of security alerts to help reduce the manual burden placed on Department of Defense (DOD) cyber defense security analysts. This study implemented a Federated Analysis Security Triage Tool prototype. The FASTT prototype attempted to highlight, summarize and categorize tens of thousands of daily alerts/events. The prototype integrated a number of tools including TensorFlow deep neural network classifier, Elasticsearch and Kibana to provide an alternative approach for cyber defense analysts. FASTT provides a quick way to perform security alert reviews, speed up analyst queries/response, and to semi-automate threat intelligence reporting. The results of this study were evaluated for accuracy and usability. Results demonstrated that the accuracy of a deep neural network classifier was very high, as it was able to determine the heuristics that the cyber defense security analysts used in their review. Demonstrations and interviews with the security analysts showed that the prototype was able to quickly categorize security alerts into meaningful categories, provide fast query of the alerts, and save time in generating reports. Lastly, FASTT was able to pull the necessary information to generate Indications of Compromise (IOC) in a STIX/TAXII format that could be shared across DOD and US Government.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170757","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170757.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep learning for prioritizing and responding to intrusion detection alerts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning for prioritizing and responding to intrusion detection alerts","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170757/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417406","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170757/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning for prioritizing and responding to intrusion detection alerts","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p1mcelwee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.164727S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8170759,"authors":[{"name":"Madhuprana Goswami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Wichita State University, Wichita, USA"],"firstName":"Madhuprana","lastName":"Goswami","id":"37086092577"},{"name":"Hyuck M.

Then, this paper derives a desirable user-specific BF expression. And the numerical results indicate that the user-specific SINRs can be achieved satisfactorily with the proposed method. However, in practice, the satellite channel may not meet the channel favorable propagation condition due to the known key hole effect.

Current practice is for an onboard ship router to select a particular SATCOM link for each outgoing traffic flow based on a mission-specific routing policy. In this paper we propose an alternative solution by viewing the multi-SATCOM link utilization task as a traffic engineering and load balancing problem - in particular, as a Multi-Commodity Flow (MCF) optimization problem. We propose using the Flow Deviation Method (FDM) as a network-wide optimal load-balancing solution that maximizes total throughput and minimizes traffic flow delay and jitter. Our approach is equally valid for both UDP and TCP flows. Network-wide global optimization is carried out via a central controller in a Software Defined Networking (SDN) framework. For TCP flows we propose a novel solution that combines the best attributes of Multi-Path TCP, SDN and FDM. Compared to single-path TCP or MPTCP-SDN without FDM-based traffic optimizer, our proposed combined scheme is more efficient in bandwidth utilization, delay/jitter minimization and also robust against jamming and intermittent link failure.

However, the mobile data offloading in edge computing wireless networks imposes many new quality of service (QoS) guarantee problems which still remain opening research areas. To overcome these challenges, in this paper we propose the statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning schemes using the effective capacity theory for two types of mobile data offloading: WiFi offloading and D2D offloading, where we formulate the WiFi offloading and D2D offloading as the single-hop and two-hop wireless-link statistical QoS provisioning problems, respectively. We also derive the optimal probability of using each type of offloading which maximizes the average effective capacity for all mobile users under the following two scenarios: (1) all mobile users have the same probability of requesting the popular multimedia data contents and have the same probability to become a relay in D2D offloading; and (2) each mobile user has the distinct probability of requesting the popular multimedia data contents and the distinct probability to become a relay in D2D offloading. Finally, we evaluate and validate our proposed statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning schemes over multimedia data offloading architecture through numerical analyses.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170781","endPage":"417","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170781.pdf","startPage":"412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical quality of service provisioning over edge computing mobile wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170781/","displayDocTitle":"Statistical quality of service provisioning over edge computing mobile wireless networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417427","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170781/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical quality of service provisioning over edge computing mobile wireless networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p412zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072867S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170787,"authors":[{"name":"Raghunandan M.

We apply our methodology to 4G LTE downlink by considering each control channel as a subsystem. We also develop open-source software enabling research and education using software-defined radios. We present experimental results with open-source LTE systems and shows how the different subsystems behave under targeted interference. The analysis for the LTE downlink shows that the synchronization signals (PSS/SSS) are very resilient to interference, whereas the downlink pilots or Cell-Specific Reference signals (CRS) are the most susceptible to a synchronized protocol-aware interferer. We also analyze the severity of control channel attacks for different LTE configurations.

In a recent technological development, the signal processing for payload antenna beamforming is moved to the ground. The resultant scheme, called Ground-Based Beam Forming or GBBF (i) provides for a significant simplification to the satellite payload design, (ii) allows for improved system performance, and (iii) results in better system flexibility. A critical requirement in the GBBF system is a real-time calibration of payload antenna array. In one scheme for GBBF calibration, several transceiver systems, called Calibration Earth Stations or CESs, are placed at strategic locations within the satellite antenna coverage. CES location determination is an important system design problem for GBBF system development, as an improper choice of locations of CESs can either result in more number of CESs than necessary (thereby increasing the system cost and the CES site maintenance concerns) and/or it can deteriorate the performance of GBBF calibration. This paper describes a solution to this problem. Two criteria that the chosen CES locations should attain are described. Determination of the requisite number of CESs and their locations is cast as a problem of multi-dimensional nonlinear optimization of the selected criteria. A solution based on the stochastic annealing method is developed and its results are presented. This approach has been successfully applied in the GBBF system development for a European GEO satellite system.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170795","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170795.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170795","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","startPage":"331","endPage":"336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of locations of calibration earth stations for ground based beam forming in satellite systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Determination of locations of calibration earth stations for ground based beam forming in satellite systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170795/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170795/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417470","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of locations of calibration earth stations for ground based beam forming in satellite systems","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p331vasavada.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126142S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8170803,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00d6zdemir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, North Caralina State University, Raleigh, NC"],"firstName":"\u00d6zg\u00fcr","lastName":"\u00d6zdemir","id":"37266325100"},{"name":"Ridha Hamila","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Ridha","lastName":"Hamila","id":"37282475100"},{"name":"Naofal Al-Dhahir","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX"],"firstName":"Naofal","lastName":"Al-Dhahir","id":"37269044000"},{"name":"Ismail G\u00fcven\u00e7","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, North Caralina State University, Raleigh, NC"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"G\u00fcven\u00e7","id":"37085348460"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0595-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"8170803","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170803","abstract":"Conventional correlation-based frame synchronization techniques can suffer significant performance degradation over multi-path frequency-selective channels. As a remedy, in this paper we consider joint frame synchronization and channel estimation.

On the other hand, since the combined channel is a sparse vector, sparse channel estimation methods can be applied. We propose a joint frame synchronization and channel estimation method using the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm which exploits the sparsity of the combined channel vector. Subsequently, the channel estimate is used to design the equalizer. Our simulation results and experimental outcomes using software defined radios show that the proposed approach improves the overall system performance in terms of the mean square error (MSE) between the transmitted and the equalized symbols compared to the conventional method.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","startPage":"647","endPage":"652","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170803.pdf","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparsity-aware joint frame synchronization and channel estimation: Algorithm and USRP implementation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Synchronization","Training","Matching pursuit algorithms","Delays","Receivers","Equalizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","iterative methods","mean square error methods","software radio","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance degradation","combined channel","frame synchronization techniques","combined channel vector","orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","sparse channel estimation methods","joint frame synchronization","multipath frequency-selective channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Equalization","frame synchronization","MSE","OMP","SDR","sparse channel estimation","USRP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Sparsity-aware joint frame synchronization and channel estimation: Algorithm and USRP implementation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170803/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170803/","accessionNumber":"17417411","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparsity-aware joint frame synchronization and channel estimation: Algorithm and USRP implementation","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p647ozdemir.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056385S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8170807,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Shi","affiliation":["Intelligent Automation, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Shi","id":"37086013161"},{"name":"Yalin E.

As the preliminary step, the adversary starts with an exploratory attack based on deep learning (DL) and builds a functionally equivalent classifier by polling the online target classifier with input data and observing the returned labels. Using this inferred classifier, the adversary can select samples according to their DL scores and feed them to the original classifier. In an evasion attack, the adversary feeds the target classifier with test data after selecting samples with DL scores that are close to the decision boundary to increase the chance that these samples are misclassified. In a causative attack, the adversary feeds the target classifier with training data after changing the labels of samples with DL scores that are far away from the decision boundary to reduce the reliability of the training process. Results obtained for text and image classification show that the proposed evasion and causative attacks can significantly increase the error during test and training phases, respectively. A defense strategy is presented to change a small number of labels of the original classifier to prevent its reliable inference by the adversary and its effective use in evasion and causative attacks. These findings identify new vulnerabilities of machine learning and demonstrate that a proactive defense mechanism can reduce the impact of the underlying attacks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170807.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170807","startPage":"243","endPage":"248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evasion and causative attacks with adversarial deep learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170807/","displayDocTitle":"Evasion and causative attacks with adversarial deep learning","htmlLink":"/document/8170807/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17417346","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evasion and causative attacks with adversarial deep learning","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p243shi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086083S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8170817,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Schneible","affiliation":["Technica Corporation, Dulles, VA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Schneible","id":"38193730900"},{"name":"Alex Lu","affiliation":["Technica Corporation, Dulles, VA"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086316863"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0595-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"8170817","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1616},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Servers","Computational modeling","Anomaly detection","Image edge detection","Machine learning","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local analytics","deep learning neural networks","autoencoder model","edge device","autoencoders","distributed devices","edge computing","compute capability","centralized servers","anomaly detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Autoencoder","Deep Learning","Edge Computing","Federated Learning"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unusual signals in a set of observations. This is a vital task in a variety of fields including cybersecurity and the battlefield. In many scenarios, observations are gathered from a set of distributed mobile or small form factor devices. Traditionally, the observations are sent to centralized servers where large-scale systems perform analytics on the data gathered from all devices. However, the compute capability of these small form factor devices is ever increasing with annual improvements to hardware. A new model, known as edge computing, takes advantage of this compute capability and performs local analytics on the distributed devices. This paper presents an approach to anomaly detection that uses autoencoders, specialized deep learning neural networks, deployed on each edge device, to perform analytics and identify anomalous observations in a distributed fashion. Simultaneously, the autoencoders learn from the new observations in order to identify new trends. A centralized server aggregates the updated models and distributes them back to the edge devices when a connection is available. This architecture reduces the bandwidth and connectivity requirements between the edge devices and the central server as only the autoencoder model and anomalous observations must be sent to the central servers, rather than all observation data.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170817","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170817.pdf","startPage":"678","endPage":"682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection on the edge","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170817/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection on the edge","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417441","htmlLink":"/document/8170817/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection on the edge","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p678schneible.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042972S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170819,"authors":[{"name":"Sohraab Soltani","affiliation":["Intelligent Automation, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sohraab","lastName":"Soltani","id":"37684320500"},{"name":"Yalin E.

The backpressure algorithm is known to provide throughput optimal solutions to joint routing and scheduling for dynamic packet traffic. This solution applies to cognitive radio networks with spectrum dynamics changing over time and space, and supports joint routing and spectrum access without any need for end-to-end path maintenance. The backpressure algorithm is extended to multicast traffic with network coding deployed over virtual queues that represent different flows per session and destination. This extension is supported with different methods to decode packets at destinations. In the absence of a common control channel, distributed coordination with local information exchange is used to support neighborhood discovery, spectrum sensing and channel estimation that are integrated with joint routing, channel access and network coding. Cognitive network functionalities are implemented with GNU Radio and Python modules for different network layers, and used with USRP N210 radios. Practical radio implementation issues are addressed in a distributed wireless network setting, where USRP N210 radios communicate with each other through RFnest, a high fidelity wireless network emulation tool. RFnest provides realistic physical channel environment by digitally controlling path loss, fading, delay, topology and mobility effects. Extensive emulation test results are provided to assess throughput, backlog and energy consumption and verify the SDR implementation of joint network coding and backpressure algorithm under realistic channel and radio hardware effects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170819/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17417459","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170819/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Joint network coding and backpressure algorithm for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint network coding and backpressure algorithm for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p858soltani.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074888S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8170823,"authors":[{"name":"Warren Smith","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory"],"firstName":"Warren","lastName":"Smith","id":"37086118716"},{"name":"Greg Kuperman","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory"],"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Kuperman","id":"38273657700"},{"name":"Michael Chan","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Chan","id":"37086330796"},{"name":"Eric Morgan","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Morgan","id":"37088741072"},{"name":"Huy Nguyen","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory"],"firstName":"Huy","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37733893100"},{"name":"Nabil Schear","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Schear","id":"37671458700"},{"name":"Bich Vu","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory"],"firstName":"Bich","lastName":"Vu","id":"37088739464"},{"name":"Andrew Weinert","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Weinert","id":"38547608800"},{"name":"Matthew Weyant","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Weyant","id":"37088735295"},{"name":"Daniel Whisman","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Whisman","id":"37086171974"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0595-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"8170823","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":545},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud computing in tactical environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170823","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computer architecture","Streaming media","Quality of service","Bandwidth","Personnel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data analysis","military computing","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-level design","cloud computing","tactical environments","ground personnel","tactical edge","representative applications","software stack","scarce resource use optimization","hardware stack","data analytics"]}],"abstract":"Ground personnel at the tactical edge often lack data and analytics that would increase their effectiveness.

While existing CRNs routing solution, generally, overlook the interference caused by the Hidden Interfering Primary User (HIPU), STAR defines a HIPU-free transmission zone, that enables successful transmission and selects a stable route that is free from interference along the path to the destination. STAR uses prediction based model to estimate the link stability and the link propagation delay. To quantitatively select the best stable links along the route, STAR implements an objective function, cognitive stable link (CSL), that captures node mobility, interference by the HIPU, link propagation delay, and the distance towards the destination. We evaluate STAR, while comparing its throughput, latency, and packet loss ratio to three other protocols, namely PCTC, J-SRCA and AODV. Evaluation on MATLAB shows that STAR achieves higher throughput while reducing the end-to-end latency and the packet loss in the network.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","startPage":"569","endPage":"574","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170832.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"STAR: STAble routing for hidden interfering primary user problems in mobile cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170832/","displayDocTitle":"STAR: STAble routing for hidden interfering primary user problems in mobile cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417423","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"STAR: STAble routing for hidden interfering primary user problems in mobile cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p569parvin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084129S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170840,"authors":[{"name":"Mahi Abdelbar","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wireless @ VT, Virginia Tech"],"firstName":"Mahi","lastName":"Abdelbar","id":"37085450200"},{"name":"R.

Meanwhile, new applications and services for mobile devices, including the recent Enhanced 911 (E911), require accurate indoor location information up to the room/suite level. In this work, a new system for improving indoor localization of mobile users is presented by exploiting trajectory tracking techniques using neural networks (NNs). The motion trajectories of indoor mobile users are tracked using conventional positioning algorithms, then a NN is applied to identify the current room location of a mobile user based on the tracked motion trajectory. Simulation results show that the trajectory-based NN is able to provide indoor location information at the room level with much higher accuracy in different scenarios, with an enhancement of up to 49% in correct room identification, as compared to positioning techniques based only on a single-point location estimate. In addition, miss-classification of the NN system will result in selecting one of the immediate neighboring rooms instead with at least 30% probability.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170840","startPage":"519","endPage":"524","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170840.pdf","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indoor localization through trajectory tracking using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Trajectory","Buildings","Mobile communication","Tracking","Layout","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","indoor navigation","indoor radio","mobile computing","mobile radio","neural nets","position control","probability","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile devices","E911","indoor localization","trajectory tracking techniques","neural networks","motion trajectories","indoor mobile users","conventional positioning algorithms","tracked motion trajectory","correct room identification","single-point location estimate","NN system","cellular positioning techniques","highly accurate location information","indoor environments","indoor location information","Enhanced 911","wireless positioning techniques"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Indoor localization through trajectory tracking using neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170840/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417473","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor localization through trajectory tracking using neural networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p519abdelbar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087157S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170844,"authors":[{"name":"Suman Bhunia","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, USA"],"firstName":"Suman","lastName":"Bhunia","id":"37533809800"},{"name":"Shamik Sengupta","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, USA"],"firstName":"Shamik","lastName":"Sengupta","id":"37288180900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0595-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"8170844","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Interference","Frequency modulation","Bandwidth","Resource management","Hardware","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","radio transceivers","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interface agility","duplex dynamic spectrum access radio","secondary user","opportunistic manner","primary user","conventional dynamic spectrum allocation methods","acquiring spectrum","fixed width channels","multiple virtual interfaces","duplex communication","cognitive radio","software defined radio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Virtual interface","DSA","GNURadio","USRP"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170844","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170844","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","abstract":"Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) based Cognitive Radio (CR) allows a secondary user (SU) to use spectrum in an opportunistic manner when the primary user (PU) of that spectrum is not transmitting.

With a prototype built with off-the-shelf software defined radio, we indicate that a node can achieve duplex communication with multiple neighbors utilizing a single transceiver.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","startPage":"762","endPage":"767","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170844.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of interface agility for duplex dynamic spectrum access radio using USRP","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170844/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of interface agility for duplex dynamic spectrum access radio using USRP","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417365","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of interface agility for duplex dynamic spectrum access radio using USRP","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p762bhunia.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048551S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170848,"authors":[{"name":"Robert T.

Therefore, increasing the spectrum to be used for a single service is not a viable strategy. As an alternative, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) could be a candidate technology to increase the throughput in radio channels with fixed bandwidth. In this paper we focus on the application of spatial MIMO to UHF military satellite communications. We present UHF MIMO measurement results in a mobile satellite-to-car channel, where the car is equipped with non-directional antennas. The results quantify the capacity gains to be expected in case of a Rician satellite channel. We compare the measured channel capacities with a stationary setup as well as theoretical predictions evaluated by simulations. Due to the line-of-sight channel, a clear dependence of the channel capacity on the antenna array geometry can be observed. From the results we conclude that the maximum MIMO channel capacity can be achieved in both, stationary as well as mobile UHF scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170848.pdf","startPage":"447","endPage":"452","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The multiple-satellite MIMO channel of narrow band vehicular communications at UHF","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna measurements","Satellites","UHF measurements","Antenna arrays","Channel capacity","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","directive antennas","military communication","MIMO communication","mobile radio","mobile satellite communication","UHF antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-satellite MIMO channel","narrow band vehicular communications","UHF frequencies","narrowband channels","multiple-input-multiple-output","radio channels","fixed bandwidth","spatial MIMO","UHF military satellite communications","UHF MIMO measurement results","satellite-to-car channel","nondirectional antennas","capacity gains","Rician satellite channel","measured channel capacities","line-of-sight channel","maximum MIMO channel capacity","mobile UHF scenarios","data intensive services"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"The multiple-satellite MIMO channel of narrow band vehicular communications at UHF","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170848/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417481","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The multiple-satellite MIMO channel of narrow band vehicular communications at UHF","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p447schwarz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065508S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170850,"authors":[{"name":"Jingchao Bao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA"],"firstName":"Jingchao","lastName":"Bao","id":"37085780689"},{"name":"Derek Sprinz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA"],"firstName":"Derek","lastName":"Sprinz","id":"37086281146"},{"name":"Husheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA"],"firstName":"Husheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37086259498"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0595-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"8170850","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":418},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Propellers","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitters","Modulation","Loss measurement","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft communication","autonomous aerial vehicles","rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter wave communication","unmanned aerial vehicles","hostile environment","safety concern","UAV communications","high throughput capability","MMwave communications","widely recognized channel model","blockage effect","fast but periodic blockage","rotor UAV","MMwave communication","drone propeller","throughput loss mitigation","heartbeat channel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170850","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170850","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","abstract":"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in military due to the hostile environment and safety concern.

While likelihood-based and feature-based techniques are effective, making classification decisions directly on the raw IQ samples allows for reduced system complexity and removes the need for expertly crafted transformations and feature extractions. In practice, RF environments are typically very dense, and a receiver must first detect and isolate each signal of interest before classification can be performed. The errors introduced by this detection and isolation process will affect the accuracy of convolutional neural networks making automatic modulation classification decisions using only raw IQ samples. To quantify this impact, a representative convolutional neural network designed to distinguish between 8 modulation classes (2FSK, 4FSK, 8FSK, BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM), over a generalized parameter set, is analyzed. The classification accuracy of this neural network is investigated as a function of errors in carrier frequency estimation and errors in sample rate estimation. The importance of defining upper limits on frequency and sample rate estimation errors in a detector is highlighted, and the negative effects of over-estimating or under-estimating these limits is explored.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417422","htmlLink":"/document/8170853/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Signal detection effects on deep neural networks utilizing raw IQ for modulation classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal detection effects on deep neural networks utilizing raw IQ for modulation classification","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p121hauser.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045349S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170855,"authors":[{"name":"Danda B.

However, RF spectrum sensing and sharing along with reconfigurable capabilities of SUs bring severe security vulnerabilities in the network. In this paper, we analyze physical-layer security (secrecy rates) of SUs in CRN in the presence of eavesdroppers, jammers and PU emulators (PUEs) where SUs compete not only with jammers and eavesdroppers who are trying to reduce SU's secrecy rates but also against PUEs who are trying to compel the SUs from their current channel by imitating the behavior of PUs. In addition, a legitimate SU competes with other SUs with a sharing attitude for dynamic spectrum access to gain a high secrecy rate, however, the malicious users (i.e., attackers) attempt to abuse the channels egotistically. The main contribution of this work is the design of a game theoretic approach to maximize utilities (that is proportional to secrecy rates) of SUs in the presence of eavesdroppers, jammers and PUEs. Furthermore, SUs use signal energy and cyclostationary feature detection along with location verification technique to detect PUEs. As the proposed approach is generic and considers different attackers, it can be particularized to a situation with eavesdroppers only, jammers only or PUEs only while evaluating physical-layer security of SUs in CRN. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using results obtained from simulations. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms other existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170855","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170855.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170855","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","startPage":"659","endPage":"665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating physical-layer security for secondary users in cognitive radio systems with attackers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170855","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating physical-layer security for secondary users in cognitive radio systems with attackers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170855/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170855/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417472","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating physical-layer security for secondary users in cognitive radio systems with attackers","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p659rawat.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112914S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8170856,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Di Renzo","affiliation":["CNRS, University Paris-Sud, Gif-sur-Yvette (Paris), France"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Di Renzo","id":"37391990500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0595-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"8170856","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":549},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Modulation","Radio frequency","Wireless communication","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","Internet of Things","MIMO communication","modulation","protocols","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable antennas","air interface","future communication networks","energy efficiency","IoT applications","RecAnt-SM","simple RecAnt designs","spatial modulation","multiple-input-multiple-output systems","protocol stack","MIMO-aided radio access technologies","low-complexity systems"]}],"abstract":"The emerging market of the Internet of Things (IoT) requires new energy-efficient and low-complexity Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO-) aided radio access technologies.

RecAnt-SM constitutes a promising new air interface in the context of MIMO-aided transmission, which can be beneficially invoked for the design of medium-throughput, low-complexity and energy-efficient communication systems by relying on a limited number of RF chains and the flexibility of simple RecAnt designs.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170856","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170856.pdf","startPage":"495","endPage":"500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial modulation based on reconfigurable antennas \u2014 A new air interface for the IoT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Spatial modulation based on reconfigurable antennas \u2014 A new air interface for the IoT","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170856/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17417396","htmlLink":"/document/8170856/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial modulation based on reconfigurable antennas \u2014 A new air interface for the IoT","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p495direnzo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065441S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8170858,"authors":[{"name":"Xueping Liang","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Tennessee State University, Nashville, TN","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xueping","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085990188"},{"name":"Juan Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086324800"},{"name":"Sachin Shetty","affiliation":["Virginia Modeling Analysis and Simulation Center, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA"],"firstName":"Sachin","lastName":"Shetty","id":"37306356900"},{"name":"Danyi Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Danyi","lastName":"Li","id":"37086324229"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0595-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"8170858","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3285},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170858","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Drones","Control systems","Servers","Distributed databases","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data integration","data integrity","Internet of Things","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traditional cloud server","hashed data records","blockchain network","blockchain receipt","data record","security guarantee","drone data collection","public blockchain","data integrity","drone data assurance","resilience","crucial security issues","IoT scenarios","drone communication","blockchain technology","data transmission","data collection","cloud-based IoT applications","process capability","cloud auditing","distributed system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reliability","Secure communication","Date Assurance","Blockchain","Drone","Auditing","Resilience","Integrity"]}],"abstract":"Data assurance and resilience are crucial security issues in cloud-based IoT applications. With the widespread adoption of drones in IoT scenarios such as warfare, agriculture and delivery, effective solutions to protect data integrity and communications between drones and the control system have been in urgent demand to prevent potential vulnerabilities that may cause heavy losses. To secure drone communication during data collection and transmission, as well as preserve the integrity of collected data, we propose a distributed solution by utilizing blockchain technology along with the traditional cloud server. Instead of registering the drone itself to the blockchain, we anchor the hashed data records collected from drones to the blockchain network and generate a blockchain receipt for each data record stored in the cloud, reducing the burden of moving drones with the limit of battery and process capability while gaining enhanced security guarantee of the data. This paper presents the idea of securing drone data collection and communication in combination with a public blockchain for provisioning data integrity and cloud auditing. The evaluation shows that our system is a reliable and distributed system for drone data assurance and resilience with acceptable overhead and scalability for a large number of drones.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170858","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170858.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards data assurance and resilience in IoT using blockchain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Towards data assurance and resilience in IoT using blockchain","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170858/","accessionNumber":"17417456","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards data assurance and resilience in IoT using blockchain","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p261liang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042877S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8170862,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Yazdani","affiliation":["University of Central Florida"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Yazdani","id":"38247168800"},{"name":"Azadeh Vosoughi","affiliation":["University of Central Florida"],"firstName":"Azadeh","lastName":"Vosoughi","id":"37284729900"},{"name":"Nazanin Rahnavard","affiliation":["University of Central Florida"],"firstName":"Nazanin","lastName":"Rahnavard","id":"37283985300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0595-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"8170862","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Multiple signal classification","Covariance matrices","Array signal processing","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","compressed sensing","computational complexity","direction-of-arrival estimation","mean square error methods","minimisation","signal classification","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","ESPAR antenna","compressive sensing","DoA estimation problem","overcomplete dictionary","sampling grid","reactance domain multiple signal classification spatial spectrum","RD-MUSIC algorithms","electronically steerable parasitic array radiator antenna","reweighted greedy block coordinate descent algorithm","mixed-norm \u21132,1 minimization problem","RW-\u21132,1-SVD","RW-GBCD","reweighted \u21132,1-SVD algorithm","root mean square error","RMSE","beampatterns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","direction-of-arrival (DoA)","electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (ESPAR)","reweighted greedy block coordinate descent (RW-GBCD)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation using electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (ESPAR) antenna based on compressive sensing.

In particular airport surface environments are one of the areas in which rapid development of communication systems is taking place. Several years ago the Federal Aviation Administration, EUROCONTROL, and the International Civil Aviation Organization proposed a communication system based on WiMAX technology for airport surface areas: AeroMACS. The AeroMACS communication system is designed for civil aircraft but could also be applied to military airports as well. In this paper we investigate a new communication system for the unique airport surface environment. Our system has physical layer specifications similar to the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) approach used in AeroMACS, but is instead based on the filterbank multicarrier (FBMC) technique. Via computer simulations, using channel models based on measured data collected by NASA Glenn Research Center, we illustrate the FBMC advantages over AeroMACS. Our results show that using zero-forcing or least-square (LS) channel estimation techniques, FBMC and AeroMACS have similar performance, but FBMC affords a significant gain in throughput. Although FBMC has slightly worse bit error ratio (BER) performance than AeroMACS at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) the throughput advantage of the proposed FBMC design is approximately 23 percent.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced airport surface multi-carrier communication systems: Filterbank advantages over AeroMACS OFDM","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170871","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125230/8170714/08170871.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170714","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced airport surface multi-carrier communication systems: Filterbank advantages over AeroMACS OFDM","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170871/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417391","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced airport surface multi-carrier communication systems: Filterbank advantages over AeroMACS OFDM","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p209jamal.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042901S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125230","isNumber":"8170714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125230","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8170714","articleId":"8170871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170875,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaopeng Yan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaopeng","lastName":"Yan","id":"37086309816"},{"name":"Jianhua Ge","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Ge","id":"37273602800"},{"name":"Yangyang Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yangyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086033965"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8170875","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":357},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","NOMA","Fading channels","Power system reliability","Probability","Mobile communication","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","fading channels","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","multi-access systems","Nakagami channels","probability","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NOMA","orthogonal multiple access","spectral efficiency","nonorthogonal multiple access","multiple-antenna 5G relaying networks","fifth generation multiple access","exact outage probability","ergodic sum rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["non-orthogonal multiple access","multiple-input multiple-output","Nakagami-m fading","outage probability","ergodic sum rate"]}],"abstract":"Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), which is an effective solution to improve spectral efficiency, has been considered as an emerging candidate for the fifth generation (5G) multiple access.

Close agreement is achieved between the results obtained in this study and previously reported results, thereby validating the generalization of the proposed channel model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cluster-based geometrical dynamic stochastic model for MIMO scattering channels","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170876","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170876.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Cluster-based geometrical dynamic stochastic model for MIMO scattering channels","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170876/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416705","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster-based geometrical dynamic stochastic model for MIMO scattering channels","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570364740.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071839S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170880,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37066313200"},{"name":"Chenhao Qi","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chenhao","lastName":"Qi","id":"37707041000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8170880","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Fading channels","Correlation","Satellites","Doppler effect","Analytical models","Shadow mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","electromagnetic wave polarisation","MIMO communication","mobile satellite communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land mobile satellite communications","dual-polarized MIMO channel","MIMO LMS system","single-output LMS system","polarization correlation","temporal correlation","channel factors","dual-polarized MIMO LMS channel","noise figure 20.0 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Land mobile satellite (LMS)","multi-input multi-output (MIMO)","dual polarization","channel model"]}],"abstract":"The channel factors during signal propagation from the satellite to moving user terminal (UT) is comprehensively analyzed.

To take full advantage of MPA's feature of parallelism, this letter proposes a hardware implementation strategy of max-log MPA decoder used in SCMA systems with soft baseband, which is based on general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU). By splitting the decoding process into independent and concurrent threads, the proposed strategy can significantly reduce the process latency of max-log MPA decoder.

However, its design flexibility is limited by the fact that the number of transmitters has to be a power of two, given that the number of bits mapped by the transmit antenna index at each time slot is required to be an integer. In the paper, to break the limitation on the required number of transmitters, a new bit mapping scheme for OSM based VLC with an arbitrary number of transmitters is proposed. When the number of transmitters is not a power of two, the symbols at the transmitters are mapped by different numbers of bits. By employing the pulse amplitude modulation, constellations with different modulation orders are exploited for radiated symbols so as to guarantee that the total number of bits transmitted at each timeslot remains the same. Moreover, the channel state information at the transmitters is taken into consideration in order to obtain better performance. Furthermore, a new channel adaptive bit mapping scheme is proposed. Numerical results on bit error rate performance are provided and substantiate that the proposed scheme can achieve better performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical spatial modulation based visible light communications with an arbitrary number of transmitters","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170885","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170885.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Optical spatial modulation based visible light communications with an arbitrary number of transmitters","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170885/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416812","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical spatial modulation based visible light communications with an arbitrary number of transmitters","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570374021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066993S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170886,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Yuan Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University, Hefei, China","Key Lab of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology, Ministry of Education, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jin-Yuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37716383900"},{"name":"Jun-Bo Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jun-Bo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37677215800"},{"name":"Jian-Xia Zhu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jian-Xia","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086301866"},{"name":"Cheng Liu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086303064"},{"name":"Ming Chen","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280976800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8170886","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Atmospheric modeling","Fading channels","Optical noise","Gaussian noise","System performance","Optical attenuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric turbulence","error statistics","fading channels","Gaussian noise","optical communication","optical links","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["serial decode-and-forward relay-aided FSO communication system","relay-aided free-space optical communications","end-to-end bit error rate","composite channel fading","noise variance","Gaussian noise","relay-aided transmission technique","long-distance transmissions","end-to-end BER","input-dependent noise"]}],"abstract":"For long-distance transmissions, relay-aided transmission technique is a promising solution to improve the performance for the free-space optical (FSO) communications.

In particular, we prove that the spectrally and energy efficient OFDM (SEE-OFDM, also known as layered ACO-OFDM) achieves the asymptotic capacity of the discrete-time Gaussian optical intensity channel under average power constraint to within 0.07 bits at high SNR.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170888","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170888.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information rates of unipolar OFDM schemes in Gaussian optical intensity channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170888/","displayDocTitle":"Information rates of unipolar OFDM schemes in Gaussian optical intensity channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416847","htmlLink":"/document/8170888/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information rates of unipolar OFDM schemes in Gaussian optical intensity channel","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570374697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081563S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170889,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenwei Xie","affiliation":["Key Wireless Laboratory of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenwei","lastName":"Xie","id":"37086264719"},{"name":"Qi Zhu","affiliation":["Key Wireless Laboratory of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37535153600"},{"name":"Su Zhao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Su","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38241143000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8170889","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Cognitive radio","Throughput","Convex functions","Energy harvesting","Relay networks (telecommunications)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","convex programming","iterative methods","relay networks (telecommunication)","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation algorithm","energy cooperation","two-way cognitive radio relay network","joint optimization algorithm","maximization problem","convex optimization problem","power allocation problem","energy transmission problem","iteration water-filling algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["energy harvesting (EH)","energy cooperation","cognitive radio","resource allocation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170889","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170889","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","abstract":"We consider a two-way cognitive radio relay network where two secondary users (SUs) can simultaneously transfer energy and information to a relay.

In this paper, two concepts named eavesdropping rate and eavesdropping outage probability are defined to evaluate the eavesdropping performance of legitimate monitor. Against the energy-ratio-based detection exploited by suspicious users, a hybrid eavesdropping approach is proposed. The hybrid eavesdropping approach includes the passive eavesdropping and the active eavesdropping, and switches between them depending on the requirements of eavesdropping performance. Furthermore, two active eavesdropping schemes are given. One is to maximize the eavesdropping rate under pilot spoofing attack power constraint, the other is to minimize the pilot spoofing attack power of monitor by satisfying the eavesdropping rate requirements.

The interference components in potential observations are theoretically analyzed and approximately estimated by exploiting the statistical model of the clipped DCO-OFDM signal. Then, the modified CS scheme eliminates the estimated interference from the potential observations, which can minimize the contamination influence of channel noise on CS recovery algorithm. In addition, a strategy jointly considering the compressed ratio and the decision noise is presented to generate the measurement matrix, which can sample the reliable data tones as final observations. With this scheme, the clipping noise in time domain can be effectively corrected and the bit error rate (BER) performance of the system is significantly improved.

The pilot allocation optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate of the system while guaranteeing the fairness among users. A heuristic algorithm, i.e. Min Leakage algorithm, is proposed to solve the optimization problem with rather low complexity. Considering that the Min Leakage algorithm can only provide a suboptimal performance, to further improve the sum rate of the system and the fairness among users, User-Exchange algorithm Based on Greedy pilot allocation (UEBG) is proposed. Simulations are done to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, and results show that the proposed scheme can not only achieve a good sum rate performance, but also guarantee the fairness among users. In addition, it is shown that the proposed UEBG algorithm achieves almost the same performance with the exhaustive algorithm, but with quite low computational complexity compared to the exhaustive algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient and fair pilot allocation for multi-cell massive MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170900","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170900.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and fair pilot allocation for multi-cell massive MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170900/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416771","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and fair pilot allocation for multi-cell massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570375487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066542S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170902,"authors":[{"name":"Yaoyao Sun","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yaoyao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086290461"},{"name":"Zhengquan Li","affiliation":["State key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhengquan","lastName":"Li","id":"37086185034"},{"name":"Chi Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086228909"},{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085365026"},{"name":"Feng Yan","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Yan","id":"37086004786"},{"name":"Lianfeng Shen","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lianfeng","lastName":"Shen","id":"37287404700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8170902","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handheld computers","MIMO","Detectors","Channel estimation","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computational complexity","least mean squares methods","matrix algebra","message passing","MIMO communication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SSOR iteration","large-scale MIMO systems","antennae","terminals","prohibitive computational complexity","conventional linear detection","minimum mean square error signal detection","random matrix","matrix inversion","low-complexity MMSE detection scheme","channel estimation scheme","channel hardening-exploiting message passing receiver","MSSD algorithm","multiple-input multiple-output systems","spectral efficiency","symmetric successive over relaxation method","channel gain matrix","CHEMP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Large-scale MIMO systems","MMSE","symmetric successive over relaxation (SSOR)","channel hardening"]}],"abstract":"The scaling up of antennae and terminals in large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems helps increase the spectral efficiency at the penalty of prohibitive computational complexity. In conventional linear detection such as the minimum mean square error (MMSE) signal detection, the high complexity is mainly caused by solving the inversion of random matrix, especially in large-scale MIMO systems. In order to reduce the complexity of the matrix inversion, we proposed a low-complexity MMSE detection scheme based on symmetric successive over relaxation (SSOR) method, referred to as MSSD method. The proposed method exploits the channel hardening phenomenon, which means the off-diagonal terms of the H\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</sup>\nH matrix become increasingly weaker compared to the diagonal terms as the size of the channel gain matrix H increases. In addition, we point out that the channel estimation scheme used in channel hardening-exploiting message passing receiver (CHEMP) is very suitable for the MSSD algorithm.

CP is introduced into OFDM systems to prevent interference caused by the multipath fading, as long as it is no shorter than the channel delay spread. The basic principle of the proposed approach is to destroy this CP validity condition by constructing a path of the target signal with a delay larger than the CP length. Specifically, the jammer captures the ongoing OFDM signal and then forwards it with an intended delay. The aggregation of the target and jamming signals is thus equivalent to a faded target signal suffering a multipath channel of an overlong delay spread that cannot be absorbed by the CP. Both inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) are induced. The OFDM transmission can therefore be disrupted due to the loss of subcarrier orthogonality. Moreover, as the jamming signal is actually a delayed version of the target signal, the jamming attack is hard to be detected. Compared with the existing OFDM jamming methods, the proposed scheme can be easily implemented without synchronization to the target signal or detailed frame structure of the target system.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170905","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170905.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient and unrecognizable OFDM jamming by failing the cyclic prefix functionality","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and unrecognizable OFDM jamming by failing the cyclic prefix functionality","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170905/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416677","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170905/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and unrecognizable OFDM jamming by failing the cyclic prefix functionality","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570375663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042033S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170906,"authors":[{"name":"Dongliang Su","affiliation":["Department of Communication Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Dongliang","lastName":"Su","id":"37086315644"},{"name":"Yi Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37292011800"},{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085864753"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8170906","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","MIMO","Linear antenna arrays","Programming","Symmetric matrices","Covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","mathematical programming","MIMO communication","minimax techniques","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["omnidirectional beamforming","massive MIMO","public channels","massive multiinput multioutput scenario","max-min optimization problem","semidefinite programming based technique","transmit power constraints","semidefinite relaxation technique","reliable omnidirectional transmission","beamformer","equal average transmit-power","uniform rectangular array","signal transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Omnidirectional transmission","common signal transmission","massive MIMO","semidifinite programming","rank reduction"]}],"abstract":"In public channels, common signals need to be transmitted omnidirectionally to achieve cell-wide coverage.

The calibration model is built and two calibration matrices are designed to precode the uplink and downlink transmission, respectively. Complexity analysis shows that the proposed scheme is with low computational complexity, which is linear in the number of antennas at the base station and mobile station. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can restore the channel reciprocity and provide the performance of bit error rate and cumulative distribution functions of downlink capacity close to the ideal case without IQ imbalance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A time-domain calibration scheme of channel reciprocity for TDD MIMO-OFDM system with IQ imbalance","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170913","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170913.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A time-domain calibration scheme of channel reciprocity for TDD MIMO-OFDM system with IQ imbalance","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170913/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416916","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A time-domain calibration scheme of channel reciprocity for TDD MIMO-OFDM system with IQ imbalance","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570376009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045139S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170914,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Hu","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086301351"},{"name":"Jun Tong","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Tong","id":"37085574901"},{"name":"Jiangtao Xi","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Jiangtao","lastName":"Xi","id":"37273716500"},{"name":"Qinghua Guo","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Qinghua","lastName":"Guo","id":"37273105900"},{"name":"Yanguang Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Yanguang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085657298"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8170914","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":286},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","NIST","Switches","Antenna arrays","MIMO","Training","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","compressed sensing","matrix algebra","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SE","CS","compressive sensing","switch-based hybrid massive MIMO structure","matrix completion","millimeter wave communications","power consumption","hardware complexity","mmWave MIMO systems","robust channel estimation","CS estimators","MC","near-optimal spectral efficiency","hybrid structure","low-complexity channel estimator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","matrix completion","millimeter wave","large-scale MIMO"]}],"abstract":"Recently, a switch-based hybrid massive MIMO structure that aims to reduce the hardware complexity and power consumption has been proposed as a potential candidate for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications.

To meet these requirements, the contention based grant-free sparse code multiple access (SCMA) transmission which can support a large number of devices and reduce the cost of signaling overhead caused by massive connection is proposed. It allows user equipment (UE) to transmit in the preconfigured radio resources shared by multiple UEs, which is called contention transmission unit (CTU). Since several UEs can be mapped to the same CTU in the transmission, collision may occur. In the conventional set-up, the UE is allocated to a CTU by the fixed mapping rule, which brings the problem of unfairness among the UEs and the probability that UE may collide again in retransmission. In this paper, we propose a new mapping rule, which utilizes the Acknowledgement (ACK) feedback to indicate the radio resource allocation. The theoretical deduction confirms the superiority of the proposed method. The simulation results show that collision probability is reduced by around 20%.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170921","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170921.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ACK feedback based UE-to-CTU mapping rule for SCMA uplink grant-free transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170921/","displayDocTitle":"ACK feedback based UE-to-CTU mapping rule for SCMA uplink grant-free transmission","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170921/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416932","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ACK feedback based UE-to-CTU mapping rule for SCMA uplink grant-free transmission","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570376452.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062087S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170922,"authors":[{"name":"Peihan Qi","affiliation":["Integrated Service Networks Lab Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Peihan","lastName":"Qi","id":"38247189600"},{"name":"Zan Li","affiliation":["Integrated Service Networks Lab Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zan","lastName":"Li","id":"37279082100"},{"name":"Wenchi Cheng","affiliation":["Integrated Service Networks Lab Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wenchi","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37676640100"},{"name":"Jiangbo Si","affiliation":["Integrated Service Networks Lab Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jiangbo","lastName":"Si","id":"37402423800"},{"name":"Qihui Wu","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qihui","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086335607"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8170922","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Correlation","Signal processing algorithms","Noise measurement","Sparse matrices","Wideband","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","compressed sensing","matrix algebra","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Residual correlation matrix detection","blind sub-Nyquist spectrum sensing","cognitive radio networks","compressed sensing theory","conventional wideband spectrum sensing","existing SNSS methods","iteration process","practical CR scenarios","blind SNSS algorithm","multicoset sub-Nyquist sampling framework","signal recovery stage","residual correlation matrix detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sub-Nyquist spectrum sensing","multicoset sampling","blind spectrum sensing","eigenvalue","support recovery"]}],"abstract":"Benefiting from compressed sensing theory, sub-Nyquist spectrum sensing (SNSS) has been considered as a promising way to deal with the implementation limitations of conventional wideband spectrum sensing in cognitive radio (CR) networks.

A theoretical analysis for further explaining where the performance gain comes from is in order. In this paper, we try to provide such an analysis for concatenated polar codes from the distance spectrum point of view, and explore their performances with the use of successive cancellation list decoding (SCLD) and ordered statistics decoding (OSD), respectively. Numerical results show that, compared with OSD, SCLD cannot fully take the advantage of optimized weight distribution for short polar codes with CRC polynomials. We also investigate a hybrid serial concatenation scheme using both CRC and PC codes, which seems to outperform the cases when using only CRC or only PC codes as the outer code. Furthermore, we introduce an improved design for CRC-polar coding scheme by optimizing CRC bit positions and the information bits involved in the CRC functions. Simulation results show that our design leads to an improved weight distribution and thus achieves better error correcting performance.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170924","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170924.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distance spectrum and optimized design of concatenated polar codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distance spectrum and optimized design of concatenated polar codes","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416958","htmlLink":"/document/8170924/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distance spectrum and optimized design of concatenated polar codes","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570376494.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057029S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8170928,"authors":[{"name":"Jinshun Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jinshun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085637897"},{"name":"Shancheng Zhao","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shancheng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38241136100"},{"name":"Xiao Ma","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37279526900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8170928","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication systems","Optical receivers","Iterative decoding","Modulation","Adaptive optics","Optical pulses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric turbulence","error statistics","iterative decoding","Markov processes","modulation coding","optical links","optical receivers","pulse position modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BMST-PPM system","BER performance curve","free-space optical links","iterative receiver","pulse position modulation","free-space optical communication systems","high power efficiency","coding scheme","Block Markov superposition transmission","predictable performance","atmospheric turbulence channels","equivalent system","bit-error-rate","low error rate region","BMST-PPM scheme","noniterative receiver","Shannon limit","iterative sliding-window detection-decoding"]}],"abstract":"Pulse position modulation (PPM) is widely employed in free-space optical (FSO) communication systems owing to its high power efficiency. Recently, a coding scheme called Block Markov superposition transmission (BMST) is proposed with a predictable performance lower bound and the ability to approach the Shannon limit. In this paper, we present the BMST coded PPM scheme with iterative receiver to improve the reliability over atmospheric turbulence channels. Based on analyzing an equivalent system, a lower bound on the bit-error-rate (BER) of the proposed scheme is presented. Extensive simulations are performed which show that: under a wide range of turbulence conditions, 1) the BER of the BMST-PPM system matches well with the corresponding lower bound in the low error rate region, implying the near-optimality of the iterative sliding-window detection/decoding algorithm; 2) the BMST-PPM scheme with iterative receiver outperforms that with non-iterative receiver; and 3) the BMST-PPM system approaches the Shannon limit in the waterfall region of the BER performance curve.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170928","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170928.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BMST coded PPM over free-space optical links with iterative receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"BMST coded PPM over free-space optical links with iterative receiver","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170928/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416940","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170928/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BMST coded PPM over free-space optical links with iterative receiver","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570376623.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071308S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170934,"authors":[{"name":"Andong Zhou","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Lab of Wireless Communication Technologies, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Andong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086272683"},{"name":"Jie Huang","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Lab of Wireless Communication Technologies, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086069882"},{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["State Key Lab. of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.R China","Shandong Provincial Key Lab of Wireless Communication Technologies, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Sun","id":"37407530900"},{"name":"Qiuming Zhu","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qiuming","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38238160600"},{"name":"Cheng-Xiang Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Sensors, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Cheng-Xiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292500000"},{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["Shanghai Research Center for Wireless Communications (WiCO), Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37069172900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8170934","dbTime":"34 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":715},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Antenna measurements","Computational modeling","Delays","Wireless communication","Diffraction","Horn antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","expectation-maximisation algorithm","indoor communication","indoor radio","millimetre wave propagation","MIMO communication","radiowave propagation","ray tracing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing modeling","indoor environment","millimeter wave communication","fifth generation communication systems","indoor office environment","ray tracing method","uniform theory","computer simulation","environment model","normalized power angular spectrum","channel measurement data","space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization estimation algorithm","simulated properties","channel measurements","mmWave channels","radio wave propagation","electromagnetic parameters","channel properties","frequency 60.0 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["60 GHz","mmWave","channel measurements","ray tracing","SAGE"]}],"abstract":"Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has become a promising key technology of the fifth generation (5G) communication systems, and gained extensive interests.

The accuracy of ray tracing based simulation is guaranteed by a very detailed three-dimensional (3-D) environment model and proper material electromagnetic parameters. The simulation results including power delay profile (PDP) and normalized power angular spectrum (PAS) are compared with the channel measurement data which is processed by the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) estimation algorithm. Good agreements between simulated and measured properties of dominant paths are achieved in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios.

To reduce this pressure, we exploited a feedback-based method to determine the allocation of users in a multi-layer heterogeneous network. Traditional Proportional Fairness(PF) achieves a balance between system throughput and fairness. However, fairness among users should be reconsidered because applications become more diversified and have different requirements for the network. Therefore, we proposed an improved resource allocation scheme through the introduction of utility function, which can allocate resource according to the application type so as to improve fairness.

Further more, we observe that the neural network trained on the partial nonlinearity of the channel can demodulate the output signals of the channel with complete nonlinearity, which can be used to reduce the training complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network for demodulating the output signals of nonlinear systems with memory","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170944","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170944.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Neural network for demodulating the output signals of nonlinear systems with memory","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170944/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416884","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network for demodulating the output signals of nonlinear systems with memory","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570379497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069937S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170949,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless-Optical Communications, Chinese Academy of Sciences University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086085157"},{"name":"Jinkang Zhu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless-Optical Communications, Chinese Academy of Sciences University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Jinkang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37279939800"},{"name":"Sihai Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless-Optical Communications, Chinese Academy of Sciences University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Sihai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37596298100"},{"name":"Wuyang Zhou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless-Optical Communications, Chinese Academy of Sciences University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Wuyang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37435288500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8170949","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Decoding","Correlation","Channel coding","Wireless sensor networks","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","encoding","Gaussian distribution","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequential Slepian-Wolf coding","uplink transmission","machine type communications","Slepian-Wolf distributed source coding","data sources","multivariate Gaussian distribution","communication resources","massive MTC devices","base station decodes","encoded data","decoders","average decoding delay","Slepian-Wolf coding cluster","average delay","network model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170949","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170949.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tradeoff between efficiency and delay of distributed source coding for uplink transmissions in machine type communications","abstract":"In this paper, we study the tradeoff of efficiency and delay of Slepian-Wolf distributed source coding (DSC). In the considered network, Machine-Type Communications (MTC) devices transmit correlated data to one base station, the data sources follow a multi-variate Gaussian distribution. To reduce the consumption of communication resources by massive MTC devices, Slepian-Wolf coding is adopted to eliminate the redundancy in uplink transmission. Each device encodes separately and the base station decodes all the data with the aid of encoded data from other devices. The scheme that messages of MTC devices are sequentially encoded is considered. Since the decoders have to decode the messages in the same order as they are encoded, the average decoding delay will increase. We analyze the relationship between delay and the number of devices in one Slepian-Wolf coding cluster. To reduce the average delay, a network model where MTC devices are separated into grids is built, devices in the same grids will form a cluster and encode their messages with sequential Slepian-Wolf coding. An evaluation indicator combining efficiency and delay is defined and then analyzed in numerical simulations under different settings of griding granularity and correlation degree.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170949/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416936","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Tradeoff between efficiency and delay of distributed source coding for uplink transmissions in machine type communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tradeoff between efficiency and delay of distributed source coding for uplink transmissions in machine type communications","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570381340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054983S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8170952,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Xia","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences Department of EElS, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.

In view of this problem, under the two-dimensional (2-D) ISAR signal model, a novel ISAR 2-D imaging algorithm under low SNR based on improved compressive sensing is proposed in this paper. The low rank property of ISAR echo is utilized to reduce the adverse effects of noise to the conventional sparse-based algorithm and enhance the robustness of ISAR sparse imaging algorithm. The performance of proposed method is demonstrated by simulation and real experimental data.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170952.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ISAR 2-D imaging under low SNR based on improved compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Signal to noise ratio","Scattering","Radar imaging","Image resolution","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","image resolution","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse signal recovery algorithm","2-D imaging algorithm","SNR","sparse imaging algorithm","inverse synthetic aperture radar","imaging resolution","ISAR echo","low rank property","improved compressive sensing","ISAR signal model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inverse synthetic aperture radar","compressive sensing","low rank matrix denoising","two-dimensional sparse imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"ISAR 2-D imaging under low SNR based on improved compressive sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170952/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416775","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ISAR 2-D imaging under low SNR based on improved compressive sensing","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570383254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048788S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170954,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojian Liu","affiliation":["Huawei Technology CO.

In addition, the competition among populations of MTs in different service areas is to share the limited amount of bandwidth and computation resources in the accessible service providers (SPs). We analyse the stability property of the evolutionary game model and obtain the evolutionary equilibrium (EE). EE is acquired by replicator dynamics approach.

Our aim is to minimize the total transmit power for users while maximizing the number of supported users by adopting the new linear programming deflation (NLPD) algorithm. Here, the removal strategy of the NLPD algorithm is compared with the deflation based joint user removal and power allocation (DPA) algorithm and the effect of the number of relay's antennas is also analyzed for this system. Monte-Carlo simulation results indicate that with thorough removal strategy, the NLPD algorithm can support more users than that of the DPA algorithm with almost equal average transmit powers allocated for each user-pair. In addition, although both of the algorithms can accommodate all user-pairs when the number of antennas is sufficiently large, while the computational complexity of the NLPD algorithm is at least one order of magnitude lower than that of the DPA algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170962","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170962.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint power and admission control for multi-pair massive MIMO AF relaying system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170962/","displayDocTitle":"Joint power and admission control for multi-pair massive MIMO AF relaying system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416843","htmlLink":"/document/8170962/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint power and admission control for multi-pair massive MIMO AF relaying system","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570384991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083042S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170964,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086313345"},{"name":"Renhui Xu","affiliation":["PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Renhui","lastName":"Xu","id":"37587352100"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085787077"},{"name":"Laixian Peng","affiliation":["PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Laixian","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085383204"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8170964","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Optimization","Approximation algorithms","Time-domain analysis","Interference","Wireless communication","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access","optimum window function","spectral sidelobes suppression","windowing scheme","optimization problem","in-band-out-of-subband power radiation","IBOSB","GSSO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","IBOSB radiation","sidelobe suppression","windowing"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA) inherently suffers from large spectral sidelobes, which will lead to interference between users and can not be ignored.

Large-scale MIMO has been identified as a key technology for the upcoming fifth generation (5G) wireless communication systems. Message passing detection (MPD) algorithm which exploits channel hardening theory can achieve very good performance in Large-scale MIMO system. However, the complexity of the MPD algorithm grows with the number of users and the order of modulation, presenting an implementation challenge for a high-order massive MIMO system. Our proposed scheme successfully reduces computational complexity by reducing the number of symbol probability points using in iteration part.

In contrast to the most of Gibbs-sampling-based detectors in the previous arts, which assuming the numbers of transmitting and receiving antennas are similar, in this paper we assume the number of receiving antennas is much more than transmitting antennas. Numerical analysis shows the sampled symbols in the proposed algorithm will quickly converge into a small subset of the constellation, therefore the candidate quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellation could be pruned in each iteration with negligible performance loss (for instance, a 64-QAM constellation could be pruned to a 3\u00d73 subconstellation with no performance loss after two times of traversal sampling). Simulation results and complexity analysis show the proposed detector achieves a better performance than the classical minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithm with about 36.8% computation complexity saved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A layered iterative sampling algorithm for near-optimal detection in uplink massive MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170978","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170978.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A layered iterative sampling algorithm for near-optimal detection in uplink massive MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8170978/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416788","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A layered iterative sampling algorithm for near-optimal detection in uplink massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570387151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064118S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170979,"authors":[{"name":"Luyao Ni","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.

In this paper, we propose a Minorization-Maximization (MM) based hybrid precoding scheme in NOMA-mMIMO system. Firstly, we introduce a user clustering scheme which allocates two suitable users in a group. Then, a power allocation scheme is designed to achieve the power difference required by NOMA for successive interference cancellation (SIC) to distinguish user data within a cluster. The performance of the MM based hybrid precoding is thus significantly enhanced with NOMA and mMIMO. Numerical results validate our proposed scheme with better performance on average sum rate and user fairness than the conventional zero forcing (ZF) hybrid precoding mMIMO system. It is observed that the more antennas equipped on the base station (BS), the higher average sum rate the system achieves.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170982","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170982.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An minorization-maximization based hybrid precoding in NOMA-mMIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An minorization-maximization based hybrid precoding in NOMA-mMIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170982/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416754","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170982/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An minorization-maximization based hybrid precoding in NOMA-mMIMO","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570388323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06069S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170983,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaohui Yang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaohui","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085667482"},{"name":"Ming Chen","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280976800"},{"name":"Yijin Pan","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yijin","lastName":"Pan","id":"37085365595"},{"name":"Hao Xu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085665706"},{"name":"Jianfeng Shi","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianfeng","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085730476"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8170983","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay effects","Machine-to-machine communications","Multiuser detection","Partial transmit sequences","Multiaccess communication","Uplink","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","delays","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximal logarithmic likelihood problem","asynchronous multiuser detection","joint channel gains","transmission symbols detection","asynchronous detection","code division multiple access","asynchronous uplink machine-to-machine systems","adaptive step-size method","CDMA","time delays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asynchronous detection","code division multiple access (CDMA)","machine-to-machine (M2M) systems"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study multiuser detection for asynchronous uplink machine-to-machine systems with code division multiple access.

In contrast to the current secrecy designs, which generally exploit the spatial Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) (e.g. MIMO and cooperative relay approaches) or the temporal DoF (e.g. waveform-based schemes), we propose in this paper a novel binary signature design for the secure transmission of downlink code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems by exploring the DoF in the code domain. In particular, we exploit the characteristics of CDMA communications and the diversity of multipath Rayleigh fading channels. We propose to elaborately design the spreading code to minimize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the eavesdropper while ensuring the legitimate users' quality of service (QoS)/SINR. The proposed algorithms can provide a near optimal performance compared with the exhausting searching approach, but with a much lower computational complexity.

This paper further excavates the sparse structure information of the 3D massive MIMO system and suppresses noise from the perspective of adaptive filter to further improve the performance of channel estimation. The basic idea of this approach is to transform 3D massive MIMO sparse channel estimation problem into CS sparse signal reconstruction problem and then employ adaptive filtering algorithm in CS reconstruction problem. The scheme of adaptive filtering based 3D massive MIMO sparse channel estimation (AFSCE) has many advantages over other typical CS algorithms, such as its probability of exact reconstruction against measurement numbers, etc., which are verified by simulation results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170989","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170989.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive filtering based 3D massive MIMO sparse channel estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive filtering based 3D massive MIMO sparse channel estimation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170989/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416826","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170989/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive filtering based 3D massive MIMO sparse channel estimation","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570388555.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089277S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8170991,"authors":[{"name":"Yipeng Du","affiliation":["School of Computer & Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yipeng","lastName":"Du","id":"37086274341"},{"name":"Shuangshuang Han","affiliation":["School of Computer & Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuangshuang","lastName":"Han","id":"37085735196"},{"name":"Jian Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer & Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Liu","id":"37089076034"},{"name":"Yinghua Zhang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Automation, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yinghua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086636081"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8170991","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Modulation","Receiving antennas","Computational complexity","Maximum likelihood estimation","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","modulation","receiving antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exponentially increasing complexity","receiving antennas","Relaxed-Bound K-Best","reduced computational complexity","traditional sphere detection algorithm","differential unitary space-time modulation","scale multiple input multiple output","spectral energy efficiency","massive MIMO system","efficient modulation choice","MIMO transmissions","channel state information","traditional DUSTM implementation","Maximum Likelihood Detection","K"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170991","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170991","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170991.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relaxed-bound K-best sphere detection for differential unitary space-time modulation","abstract":"Large scale multiple input multiple output (MIMO), commonly referred to as massive MIMO, is one of the most important physical layer disruptions in network evolution that would lead to significant increase in spectral and energy efficiency envisioned for 5G networks. However, the computational complexity of massive MIMO system becomes the key problem for its practical implementation. As known, Differential Unitary Space-Time Modulation (DUSTM) has been proposed as an efficient modulation choice for such MIMO transmissions where channel state information (CSI) is not required at the receiver. However, traditional DUSTM implementation relies mainly on Maximum Likelihood Detection (MLD) achieving optimal performance, which is not easily compatible with massive MIMO systems due to its exponentially increasing complexity with increasing number of transmitting and receiving antennas. Therefore, in this paper, in order to overcome the aforementioned disadvantages, we propose a new detection algorithm named Relaxed-Bound K-Best Sphere Detection (RBKSD). Compared to the traditional K-Best Sphere Detection (KSD) algorithm, the main idea of our algorithm is to relax the bound K of the conventional KSD to be K + \u0393, thereby achieving quasi-optimal performance with significantly reduced computational complexity. Simulation results confirm that the proposed RBKSD algorithm shows superior performance and reduced complexity compared to other notable schemes such as MLD, traditional sphere detection algorithm and the KSD.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170991/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170991/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416930","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Relaxed-bound K-best sphere detection for differential unitary space-time modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relaxed-bound K-best sphere detection for differential unitary space-time modulation","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570388594.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062623S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":8170994,"authors":[{"name":"Zhixu Cheng","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Zhixu","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37086318709"},{"name":"Tiecheng Song","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Tiecheng","lastName":"Song","id":"37391687100"},{"name":"Jing Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086286635"},{"name":"Jing Hu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Hu","id":"37403957800"},{"name":"Yazhou Hu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Yazhou","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086316287"},{"name":"Lianfeng Shen","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Lianfeng","lastName":"Shen","id":"37287404700"},{"name":"Xi Li","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Li","id":"37086211119"},{"name":"Jun Wu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086260464"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8170994","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Self-organizing feature maps","Training","Cascading style sheets","Neurons","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","radio networks","radio spectrum management","self-organising feature maps","telecommunication computing","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic SSDF attack","cognitive radio network","secondary users","spectrum sensing data","malicious users","typical artificial neural networks","self-organizing map neural network","SOM network","SUs","average suspicion degree","traditional SOM algorithm","ASD","self-organizing map-based scheme","MU","ANN","dynamic threshold algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative spectrum sensing","Spectrum sensing data falsification","Self-organizing map","Average suspicion degree"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8170994","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170994","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","abstract":"In cognitive radio network (CRN), secondary users (SUs) suffer from the spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack launched by malicious users (MUs).

This paper investigates a wireless legitimate surveillance system, where a full-duplex multi-antenna legitimate monitor aims to eavesdrop on a dubious communication link between a suspicious pair via proactive jamming. It is assumed that the legitimate monitor can successfully eavesdrop the suspicious information only when its achievable data rate is no smaller than that of the suspicious receiver. To maximize the eavesdropping non-outage probability, optimal joint design of the jamming power, receive and transmit beamformers at the legitimate monitor is presented. Moreover, two low-complexity suboptimal beamforming schemes are proposed and the corresponding analytical results are obtained. Our outcomes demonstrate that by exploiting multiple antennas at the legitimate monitor, the eavesdropping non-outage probability exhibits a significant improvement compared to the single antenna case. In addition, the proposed suboptimal transmit zero-forcing scheme yields similar performance as the optimal scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08170995.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamformer design and performance analysis of multi-antenna wireless legitimate surveillance systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8170995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8170995/","displayDocTitle":"Beamformer design and performance analysis of multi-antenna wireless legitimate surveillance systems","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416955","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamformer design and performance analysis of multi-antenna wireless legitimate surveillance systems","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570388688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095922S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8170995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8170996,"authors":[{"name":"Ruisi He","affiliation":["State Key laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruisi","lastName":"He","id":"37709056400"},{"name":"Bo Ai","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Ai"},{"name":"Gordon L.

The Gauss-Markov mobility model is able to adjust the degree of mobility randomness. A closed-form time-variant time correlation function and the Doppler power spectrum are derived. Based on the numerical analysis, it is found that for a fixed M2M scattering environment, the motion does not introduce non-stationarity, however, the dynamic motion (i.e., the changes of velocity and moving direction) leads to non-stationarity, which is reflected by the time-variant time correlation function and Doppler spectrum.

Therefore, people begin to seek possible combination of these two promising areas. In this paper, with the aid of chemical reaction networks (CRNs), a design methodology of realizing the key block of fast convolution unit (FCU) in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed. In order to address the difficulty when \u201ccompiling\u201d a complex traditional circuit into CRNs, this paper devotes itself in offering a systematic method to construct the n-parallel FCUs, where a 3-parallel FCU case is employed as a running example. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and complexity comparison have proved the validity of this method and ensured its convenience, robustness, and efficiency. Though preliminary, the proposed method can be readily employed to design other arithmetic blocks of CNNs. Thanks to the high parallelism of CRNs, it is believed that this method offers another perspective to address the complexity of CNN implementation, especially when the system scale is large.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170998","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless

prevalently known that Markov chains have been successfully applied to many fields such as digital communications, queuing theory, and finance. However, when the system becomes massive and complex, the computational load will become too heavy to be handled by conventional approaches. To address this issue, molecular computation, which is inherently parallel, has been considered in this paper to synthesize Markov chain. Here, a succinct and systematic approach based on reversible unimolecular reactions is proposed for any time-homogeneous Markov chain, no matter it is discrete or continuous. For the chemical reaction networks (CRNs), molecular concentrations at time t reflect the probability distribution of the continuous-time Markov chain at time t. The final concentrations indicate the steady state of the Markov chain. Numerical results based on deterministic mass action kinetics have demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of this method. It is worth noting that an already mathematically-proven conclusion, which states that nearly an arbitrary set of uni- or bimolecular reactions can be implemented by DNA strand displacement reactions, ensures the meaningfulness of our work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171000/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17416983","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171000/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Synthesizing Markov chain with reversible unimolecular reactions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesizing Markov chain with reversible unimolecular reactions","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570388821.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117356S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8171002,"authors":[{"name":"Shusen Jing","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Lab of Efficient Architectures for Digital-communication and Signal-processing (LEADS)"],"firstName":"Shusen","lastName":"Jing","id":"37086197595"},{"name":"Junmei Yang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Lab of Efficient Architectures for Digital-communication and Signal-processing (LEADS)"],"firstName":"Junmei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085542629"},{"name":"Anlan Yu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Lab of Efficient Architectures for Digital-communication and Signal-processing (LEADS)"],"firstName":"Anlan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086063262"},{"name":"Xiaohu You","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"You","id":"37276505600"},{"name":"Chuan Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Lab of Efficient Architectures for Digital-communication and Signal-processing (LEADS)"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085417787"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171002","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":307},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph-merged detection and decoding of polar-coded MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171002","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Iterative decoding","Maximum likelihood decoding","Hardware","Complexity theory","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","graph theory","MIMO communication","signal detection","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless communication systems","belief prorogation detection methods","error performance","BP methods","polar code","3GPP eMBB control channel","high reliability","throughput","graph merged detection","polar-coded MIMO systems","factor graphs","polar decoding","GMDD method","conventional separated detection","spectral efficiency","data rate","multiple-input multiple-output technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO detection","polar codes","belief propagation","graph merged detection and decoding (GMDD)","factor graph"]}],"abstract":"By adopting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique, the spectral efficiency and data rate of wireless communication systems can be highly improved.

In this paper, a graph merged detection and decoding (GMDD) method for polar-coded MIMO systems is proposed.

By giving users non-orthogonal codebook with few non-zero entries, the SCMA approach can highly improve the spectral efficiency, compared with traditional orthogonal ones such as CDMA, with tolerable detection complexity. Therefore, it has been considered as an option for 5G air-interface technique. Also essential in 5G, polar code has already been adopted by 5G eMBB control channel, for its capacity-achieving capability. In this work, a joint detection and decoding (JDD) method of polar-coded SCMA system is proposed for the first time, which can highly improve the performance of the polar-SCMA systems. By merging two factor graphs together, the intrinsic messages can be exchanged iteratively to help the likelihood messages converge. Numerical results have shown that, compared to separated detection and decoding (SDD), JDD can achieve remarkable performance gain little complexity overhead.

Caching at the network edge can reduce the duplicated transmissions of the contents and improve users' quality of service (QoS), however, the dense deployment of cache-enabled small base stations (SBSs) and relays poses a challenge on energy consumption. Several emerging technologies have been focused on energy savings, such as energy harvesting and dynamic sleep mode operation of base stations (BSs). How to utilize these technologies to optimize energy consumption in cache-enabled HetNet is a hot research topic. Therefore, in this paper, a two-tier caching framework incorporating energy harvesting and sleep mechanism is proposed and joint optimization of energy-efficient sleeping and caching in the energy-harvesting based HetNet is studied. The optimization problem is formulated, aiming at maximizing energy savings in the system, which combines content placement with sleep-active scheduling for self-powered SBSs. To solve the problem, a dynamic energy-harvesting based caching algorithm with sleep-active scheduling mechanism called DECAS is proposed. Simulation results show that by using renewable energy and sleep mechanism, the proposed caching algorithm achieves significant performance gains on energy consumption and maintains high hit ratio, compared with the caching algorithms without joint optimization of energy-harvesting and sleep mechanism.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171011","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171011.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint caching and sleep-active scheduling for energy-harvesting based small cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171011/","displayDocTitle":"Joint caching and sleep-active scheduling for energy-harvesting based small cells","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416878","htmlLink":"/document/8171011/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint caching and sleep-active scheduling for energy-harvesting based small cells","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570388972.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060224S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171012,"authors":[{"name":"Anlan Yu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Lab of Efficient Architectures for Digital-communication and Signal-processing (LEADS)"],"firstName":"Anlan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086063262"},{"name":"Shusen Jing","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Lab of Efficient Architectures for Digital-communication and Signal-processing (LEADS)"],"firstName":"Shusen","lastName":"Jing","id":"37086197595"},{"name":"Yeong-Luh Ueng","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Lab of Efficient Architectures for Digital-communication and Signal-processing (LEADS)"],"firstName":"Yeong-Luh","lastName":"Ueng","id":"37393144500"},{"name":"Xiaohu You","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"You","id":"37276505600"},{"name":"Chuan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085417787"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171012","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171012","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","MIMO","Complexity theory","Hardware","Signal to noise ratio","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","error statistics","iterative decoding","MIMO communication","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO systems","relaxation MIMO detection","LDPC decoding process","SOR detection iteration","LDPC decoding iteration","IDD iteration","error performance","nonIDD method","iterative SOR detection","low-density parity-check","massive multiple-input","wireless communication systems","gain 5.0 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC codes","massive MIMO","successive over relaxation detection","iterative detection and decoding"]}],"abstract":"Low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) scheme is getting increasingly popular and sophisticated in today's wireless communication systems, since it can highly improve the spectral efficiency, data rates, and error performance.

In UWA multipath channel, the positions of UWA channel taps usually obey the Bernoulli distribution, while the coefficients of UWA channel taps obey the complex-valued Gaussian distribution. Such knowledge of distribution is considered as a prior for UWA channel estimation based on the Bayesian framework. The positions of UWA channel taps are first determined.

In poor noise environment, conventional parameter estimation methods based on cross-correlation processing of adjacent profiles give sizable aligned error. Because envelopes of range profiles produced by the traditional Fourier transform are much more tanglesome in this case. As the echo signal sampled in fast time can be approximated as the combination of multiple Chirp signals with a same Chirp rate, a symmetric accumulated cross-correlation method based on FrFT range compression (Fr-SACCM) is proposed in this paper. It maps the spectrum of the Chirp signal into a single-peaked envelope to reduce the range alignment error, and puts forward a symmetric accumulated manner to offset the accumulated phase error. Meanwhile, the proposed method conducts an optimized iterative searching scheme for the FrFT matched-order and reduces the computational complexity substantially. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has much better performance. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171026","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171026.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A symmetric accumulated cross-correlation method of parameter estimation based on fractional fourier transform for ISAR motion compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A symmetric accumulated cross-correlation method of parameter estimation based on fractional fourier transform for ISAR motion compensation","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171026/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416879","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171026/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A symmetric accumulated cross-correlation method of parameter estimation based on fractional fourier transform for ISAR motion compensation","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570389396.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054955S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171027,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Hu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086279318"},{"name":"Zemin Wu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Zemin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37633097200"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406066500"},{"name":"Chang Tian","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Chang","lastName":"Tian","id":"37630294100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171027","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayes methods","Inference algorithms","Approximation algorithms","Noise measurement","Sparse matrices","Pollution measurement","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","Bayes methods","expectation-maximisation algorithm","Gaussian distribution","Gaussian processes","gradient methods","image reconstruction","image representation","inference mechanisms","iterative methods","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal posterior","fast recovery","nonnegative sparse signals","heterogeneous noise","Bayesian inference perspective","sparsity","rectified Gaussian scale mixture","approximate approach","inference process","marginal posterior","computational cost reduction","conjugate gradient based scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sparse recovery","non-negative signals","sparse Bayesian learning","rectified Gaussian distribution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171027","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171027.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast recovery of non-negative sparse signals under heterogeneous noise","abstract":"In this paper we consider recovering non-negative sparse signals under heterogeneous noise from a Bayesian inference perspective.

To further satisfy the requirement of latency-intensive applications in the future, fog computing is proposed to take full advantages of close-by nodes with available resources, thus decreasing the transmission time during computation offloading. This paper jointly considers nearby nodes and network edge base station in fog computing to provide a mutually complementary service, making the computation resources fully utilized. Furthermore, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been introduced as a transmission technology to support high spectrum efficiency and low latency. Consequently, a new technology challenge regarding latency minimization can be facilitated as a computational offloading using NOMA. By further leveraging the concept of social networks, we therefore propose a social trust based NOMA cooperative computation offloading algorithm (SNOMA-COA) to minimize the completion time of system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves the goal to effectively reduce system latency by offloading computation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171029.pdf","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171029","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting NOMA into socially enabled computation offloading","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171029/","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting NOMA into socially enabled computation offloading","htmlLink":"/document/8171029/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17416763","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting NOMA into socially enabled computation offloading","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570389467.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088182S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8171030,"authors":[{"name":"Jiali Mao","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications & Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Jiali","lastName":"Mao","id":"37086290319"},{"name":"Ruochen Huang","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications & Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Ruochen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085878868"},{"name":"Xin Wei","affiliation":["National Engineering Research Center of Communications and Networking (NUPT), China","College of Telecommunications & Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085344011"},{"name":"Qiuxia Bao","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications & Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Qiuxia","lastName":"Bao","id":"37086138791"},{"name":"Zhenjiang Dong","affiliation":["ZTE Corporation, Cloud & IT Institute, China","School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Zhenjiang","lastName":"Dong","id":"37086256730"},{"name":"Yi Qian","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electronics Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Qian","id":"37276182400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171030","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171030","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IPTV","neural nets","quality of experience","quality of service","set-top boxes","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-term memory network","LSTM network","QoE modeling","conventional neural network","Internet Protocol Television","IPTV user QoE prediction algorithm","user quality","k-nearest neighbor","support vector machine","feature selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IPTV","LSTM Network","QoE","prediction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171030","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171030.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IPTV user QoE prediction based on the LSTM network","abstract":"With the rapid development of Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), operators are more interested in user Quality of Experience (QoE).

Despite the fact that the amount of convolutions in CNNs is proportional to that of layers, people tend to pursue more remarkable performance by exploiting a deep convolution neural network (DCNN), leading to large area occupation. With the deeper process involved in large-scale integrated circuits, circuit reliability has also aroused great concerns. In this paper, we propose an efficient convolution architecture for CNN, by employing stochastic computing. For the first step, fast convolution algorithms such as Cook-Toom algorithm, which can lower the complexity by reducing multiplications is proposed. Though stochastic computing (SC) shows advantages in area-efficient implementations, its straightforward application to fast convolution is not well-suited due to the severe precision loss. Existing two-line SC can reduce the precision loss, but fails to deal with the output saturation. Therefore, a new three-part SC representation is proposed to get rid of this dilemma. Simulation results have validated the advantages of proposed architecture in both complexity and precision. Although preliminary, it is expected that this design can be the first step of combining neural network and stochastic computing, which are both analog, belief-based, and fault-tolerant. It is believed that stochastic computing is possibly a more natural implementation form of neural network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171031/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416673","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient fast convolution architecture based on stochastic computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient fast convolution architecture based on stochastic computing","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570389536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060305S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8171032,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Xu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.

However, the deployment of Ad-hoc mobile cloud is hindered by the limitation of mobile devices, such as storage capacities and relatively short battery lives. To overcome such problem, this paper proposes a task assignment algorithm based on particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing (PSO-SA) in Ad-hoc mobile cloud. The main contribution of our work is considering the fairness of resource utilization of all devices and total energy consumption of all devices under the constraint of time delay. We also combine particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing to avoid falling into local optimal solution and guarantee the convergence speed. PSO-SA is used to make the decision for task assignment to achieve two main objectives which include minimizing total energy consumption and balancing the fairness of resource utilization of all devices. Through the simulation, it is shown that compared with other population-based optimization algorithms PSO-SA has less energy consumption and the result of PSO-SA can be close to the optimal solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416742","htmlLink":"/document/8171038/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A task assignment algorithm based on particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing in Ad-hoc mobile cloud","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A task assignment algorithm based on particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing in Ad-hoc mobile cloud","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570389740.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121074S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171040,"authors":[{"name":"Yaping Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Lab of Efficient Architectures for Digital-communication and Signal-processing (LEADS)"],"firstName":"Yaping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086321322"},{"name":"Lulu Ge","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Lab of Efficient Architectures for Digital-communication and Signal-processing (LEADS)"],"firstName":"Lulu","lastName":"Ge","id":"37085741704"},{"name":"Xiaohu You","affiliation":["Lab of Efficient Architectures for Digital-communication and Signal-processing (LEADS)"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"You","id":"37276505600"},{"name":"Chuan Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Lab of Efficient Architectures for Digital-communication and Signal-processing (LEADS)"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085417787"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171040","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":380},"abstract":"In this paper, belief propagation (BP) detection based on max-sum (MS) algorithm for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is therefore proposed to reduce computational complexity of general belief propagation. Owing to employing the approximation strategy, complexity reduction of MS is at the expense of detection performance loss. Based on MS algorithm, two effective approaches are proposed to compensate the performance loss resulting from MS detection. By introducing a normalized factor or an offset factor, performance and complexity can strike a balance to some extent for large-scale MIMO systems. Simulation results show that, for asymmetric antenna configuration, MS detection suffers negligible performance loss while keeping lower hardware complexity compared to original BP detection. Furthermore, in comparison with MS algorithm, the two modified algorithms can achieve noticeable performance improvement with minor overhead hardware complexity for symmetrical antenna configurations, which is applicable to independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) and correlated channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171040.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Belief propagation detection based on max-sum algorithm for massive MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Approximation algorithms","Complexity theory","Probability","Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis","Belief propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","approximation theory","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale MIMO systems","MS detection","negligible performance loss","lower hardware complexity","original BP detection","MS algorithm","modified algorithms","belief propagation detection","max-sum algorithm","massive MIMO systems","massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","computational complexity","general belief propagation","approximation strategy","offset factor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["belief propagation (BP)","massive MIMO","max-sum (MS)","offset and normalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Belief propagation detection based on max-sum algorithm for massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8171040/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416743","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Belief propagation detection based on max-sum algorithm for massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570389757.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061333S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171041,"authors":[{"name":"Fasheng Zhou","affiliation":["Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fasheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086296838"},{"name":"Gaoyong Luo","affiliation":["Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Gaoyong","lastName":"Luo","id":"37086302669"},{"name":"Lisheng Fan","affiliation":["Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lisheng","lastName":"Fan","id":"37086297005"},{"name":"Jie Tang","affiliation":["South University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Tang","id":"37086010196"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171041","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Array signal processing","Correlation","5G mobile communication","Antennas","Wireless communication","Fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","correlation methods","interference suppression","recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backhaul links","macro cell","interference mitigation","temporal channel correlation","training symbols","zero-forcing beamforming scheme","intra-cell interference","coordinated beamforming scheme","heterogeneous network","band-limited backhaul constraint","coordinated systems","RE-ZFBF scheme","dedicated spectrum","recursive estimation","inter-cell interference","user equipments"]}],"abstract":"Due to dense small cells deployment in a heterogeneous network, the backhaul links among the small cells and macro cell are band-limited when they share the same spectrum with the user equipments.

In this paper, a novel beamforming scheme is proposed to improve secrecy rate in an untrusted relay network, where the untrusted relay helps to improve the network coverage area but may act as a potential eavesdroper. A destination-assisted-jamming (DAJ) is used to protect the confidential information against untrusted relays and eavesdroppers. By optimizing beamforming, we align the confidential signal to the equivalent valid signal space and force it to be orthogonal to the cooperative jamming signal space.

Conventional fully digital precoding which needs one radio frequency (RF) chain per antenna is impractical in large-scale mmWave systems because of the high hardware complexity, power consumption and cost. In this paper, we propose a scheme with hybrid precoding at the base station (BS) and analog combining at each user under the limitation of RF chains. The analog precoding matrix and analog combining vectors match with the transmit and receive array response vectors of each user's strongest path, respectively. Then a low-dimensional baseband zero-forcing (ZF) precoding is preformed based on the equivalent channel seen from baseband to eliminate inter-user interference. This scheme requires only two scalar symbol feedback instead of explicit channel information for each user during one coherent period. We derive closed-form expression representing spectral efficiency of the proposed scheme and the conventional fully digital ZF precoding for comparison. It is concluded that under certain conditions, the proposed scheme can reach the performance of fully digital ZF precoding, which is considered as a virtually optimal linear precoding scheme in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

The optimal power control, user scheduling, and resource allocation scheme to maximize the overall network throughput of downlink NOMA systems is investigated in this paper. A practical imperfect channel state information (CSI) model is adopted in our investigation where only the distances of the involved links are known at the base station. In such a scenario, the closed-form optimal power control strategy is first derived for a NOMA user pair. Perfect CSI model is also investigated for comparison.

Then logarithmic utility function is adopted to maximize the utility gain of system throughput and the closed-form expression of optimal bandwidth allocation is derived. Simulation results show that our proposal can effectively improve the network throughput as compared against the orthogonal multiple access.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171063","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171063.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power control, user scheduling and resource Allocation for Downlink NOMA Systems with Imperfect Channel State Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171063/","displayDocTitle":"Power control, user scheduling and resource Allocation for Downlink NOMA Systems with Imperfect Channel State Information","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416952","htmlLink":"/document/8171063/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control, user scheduling and resource Allocation for Downlink NOMA Systems with Imperfect Channel State Information","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570389905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134673S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171065,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Lab on Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, P.

When there are a massive number of users in the system, it is impractical or inefficient to serve all users with a single multicast beamformer and within a single channel. We therefore study the joint multicast beamforming and user scheduling problem, with the objective of minimizing the total transmitting power across multiple channels by jointly assigning each user to appropriate channel and designing multicast beamformer for each channel. The problem of interest is first formulated as a mixed binary quadratically constrained quadratic program, and then reformulated as a highly structured nonsmooth optimization problem. We propose a sequential approximation scheme for the nonsmooth formulation to yield a series of parallel smooth convex subproblems, and devise a dual fast gradient projection method for the subproblem. The overall algorithm is an efficient matrix-free algorithm, which is based solely on matrix-vector multiplications and comparison operations and costs O(MK) arithmetic operations per iteration with M being the number of antennas and K being the number of users, and therefore is well suited for massive MIMO systems with a large number of users. The proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a critical point to the nonsmooth formulation problem. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed co-design scheme over conventional fixed scheduling and random scheduling.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171069","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171069.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonsmooth optimization for joint multicast beamforming and user scheduling in massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171069/","displayDocTitle":"Nonsmooth optimization for joint multicast beamforming and user scheduling in massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416827","htmlLink":"/document/8171069/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonsmooth optimization for joint multicast beamforming and user scheduling in massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570389932.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05341S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171073,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086011252"},{"name":"Dongming Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Dongming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279547400"},{"name":"Xinjiang Xia","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xinjiang","lastName":"Xia","id":"37086294107"},{"name":"Xiaohu You","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"You","id":"37276505600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171073","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":430},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","MIMO","Precoding","Phase noise","Channel estimation","Baseband","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","covariance matrices","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","phase noise","precoding","radiofrequency interference","signal processing","time division multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","radio frequency chains","oscillator phase noise","massive MIMO systems","time division duplexing operation","efficient uplink channel estimation scheme","hybrid architecture","sparse massive MIMO channels","CCM aided RF precoder","downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","hybrid precoding scheme","different phase noise","downlink performance","hybrid analog-digital processing","Monte Carlo simulations","MC simulations","channel estimation scheme"]}],"abstract":"Recent works have identified hybrid analog-digital processing as a cost-effective alternative to conventional full-digital processing in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems owing to the deployment of far less number of radio frequency (RF) chains.

We derive the theoretical results and corresponding approximate expressions of the achievable SE in single cell systems and multicell systems. Based on approximated results, analysis demonstrates that the achievable SE is decided by the transmit power, the number of antennas, the proportion of full-resolution ADCs and quantization precision of the low-resolution ADCs. Especially, we propose the power allocation algorithms based on the lower bound and upper bound of approximate achievable SE for multicell systems with Riean fading channel and MRC detector. Simulation results show that the total achievable SE improves by increasing the number of BS antennas, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the quantization precision. Moreover, by comparing the total achievable SE for the proposed power allocation algorithms and the equal power allocation algorithm, results showcase that proposed power allocation algorithms remarkably improve the total achievable SE, which verifies the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171074","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on

cellular networks, research works on enhancing cell edge performance receive considerable attention. Based on interlaced clustering, we propose a heuristic sparse beamforming strategy to improve the cell edge throughput effectively in distributed antenna systems (DASs). In our scheme, each cluster pattern (CP) is divided into several adaptive cells, where all the remote antenna units (RAUs) are connected to a central processor via finite-capacity backhaul links. Relying on the adaptive cells, we then provide a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm for the high-burden sparse beamforming design. Simulations based on practical cell parameters show that the proposed adaptive cell based sparse beamforming can achieve significant performance gain on edge user rate and further improved the sum rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17416693","htmlLink":"/document/8171075/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Sparse beamforming for interlaced clustering in distributed antenna systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse beamforming for interlaced clustering in distributed antenna systems","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570389961.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06548S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8171076,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Bo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering & Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Bo","id":"37086294755"},{"name":"Hancheng Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering & Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Hancheng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37289425200"},{"name":"Yujiao Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering & Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Yujiao","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086329136"},{"name":"Jianwen Meng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering & Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Jianwen","lastName":"Meng","id":"37086328436"},{"name":"Wenzhe Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering & Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Wenzhe","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086328610"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171076","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":657},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Machine learning","Fading channels","Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Computational complexity","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","computational complexity","fading channels","image reconstruction","iterative methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FompNet","compressive sensing reconstruction","wireless fading channel","CS","remote sensing","convex optimization algorithms","FastOMP","channel fading","reconstruction performance","reconstruction approaches","computational complexity","deep learning network","deep learning based reconstruction approach","sampling ratios","convolutional neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive Sensing","deep learning","Convolutional Neural Network","image reconstruction","wireless fading channel"]}],"abstract":"With the ability to reconstruct signals from a highly incomplete number of samples, Compressive Sensing (CS) has been proposed in bandwidth-constrained scenarios like remote sensing, where signals exist some degree of redundancy. In CS, reconstruction approaches are of great importance. However, current reconstruction approaches are of highly computational complexity because they use greedy or convex optimization algorithms with many iterations. On the other hand, the effect of wireless fading channel on the distortion performance is not well studied, which is difficult to be analyzed and formulated in CS. To tackle these challenges, we proposed a novel deep learning based reconstruction approach called FompNet. The most distinctive characteristic of FompNet is that it involves Fast Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (FastOMP) with low computational complexity before a deep learning network, i.e., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). With FastOMP, FompNet can dispose of real size images, while existing deep learning based reconstruction approaches are specified to small image patches. Besides, FastOMP makes the deep learning network adaptive to different sampling ratios, instead of another newly training process if the sampling ratio is changed. Furthermore, CNN can alleviate the effect of channel fading and significantly improve the reconstruction performance under different channel environments. Experiment results show that FompNet outperforms existing reconstruction approaches in terms of distortion and computational complexity under various channel conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FompNet: Compressive sensing reconstruction with deep learning over wireless fading channels","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171076","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171076.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171076/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"FompNet: Compressive sensing reconstruction with deep learning over wireless fading channels","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8171076/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416865","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FompNet: Compressive sensing reconstruction with deep learning over wireless fading channels","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570389971.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057422S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171078,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Zhu","affiliation":["Communication & Networking, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing, China","College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086268988"},{"name":"Xianbin Wang","affiliation":["Communication & Networking, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing, China","College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xianbin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37070494600"},{"name":"Zhaoyang Zhang","affiliation":["Communication & Networking, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing, China","College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085432187"},{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["Communication & Networking, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing, China","College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403981600"},{"name":"Yan Chen","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293321600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171078","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":583},"abstract":"In existing uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes, complicated user pairing schemes are required to ensure differentiated arriving power at the access point, which may incur considerable scheduling overhead.

energy efficiency optimization for MISO cognitive radio network with energy harvesting","abstract":"This paper investigates a secure energy efficiency (SEE) optimization problem in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) underlay cognitive radio (CR) network. In particular, a multi-antenna secondary transmitter (SU-Tx) simultaneously sends secured information and energy to a secondary receiver (SU-Rx) and an energy receiver (ER), respectively, in the presence of a primary receiver (PU-Rx). It is assumed that the SU-Rx, ER and PU-Rx are each equipped with a single antenna. In addition, the SU-Tx should satisfy constraints on maximum interference leakage to the PU-Rx and minimum harvested energy at the ER. In this CR network, we consider the transmit covariance matrix design with the assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI) at the SU-Tx. In addition, it is assumed that the ER is a potential passive eavesdropper due to broadcast nature of wireless transmission. On the other hand, we consider the worst-case scenario that ER's energy harvesting requirement is only satisfied when it performs only energy harvesting without intercepting or eavesdropping information intended for the SU-Rx. We formulate this transmit covariance matrix design as a SEE maximization problem which is a non-convex problem due the non-linear fractional objective function. To realize the solution for this non-convex problem, we utilize the non-linear fractional programming and difference of concave (DC) functions approaches to reformulate into a tractable form. Based on these techniques and the Dinkelbach's method, we propose iterative algorithms to determine the solution for the original SEE maximization problem. Numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed transmit covariance matrix design and convergence of the proposed algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171082/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17416949","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171082/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Secure energy efficiency optimization for MISO cognitive radio network with energy harvesting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure energy efficiency optimization for MISO cognitive radio network with energy harvesting","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081221S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8171083,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Chen","affiliation":["College of Physics and information Engineering, Fuzhou University"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086305364"},{"name":"Mingjian Fu","affiliation":["College of Physics and information Engineering, Fuzhou University"],"firstName":"Mingjian","lastName":"Fu","id":"37086295452"},{"name":"Wen-Kang Jia","affiliation":["College of Physics and information Engineering, Fuzhou University"],"firstName":"Wen-Kang","lastName":"Jia","id":"37086301047"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171083","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Cognitive radio","Bandwidth","Manganese","Optimization","Wireless networks","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","convex programming","radio networks","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation problem","heterogeneous cognitive radio networks","HCRNs","single-network cognitive radio users","multihoming CRUs","multiple networks","single-network CRUs","joint multidimension optimization problem","network selection","bandwidth","power allocation","joint resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["heterogeneous cognitive radio network","resource allocation","Lagrangian dual decomposition","multi-homing","single-network"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint resource allocation for multi-homing and single-network users in heterogeneous cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171083.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171083","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171083","abstract":"This paper investigates the resource allocation problem in heterogeneous cognitive radio networks (HCRNs). In this paper, two types of users, i.e., multi-homing and single-network cognitive radio users (CRUs), are considered to coexist in HCRNs. Multi-homing CRUs can access multiple networks simultaneously, while single-network CRUs can be served by only one network at a time. With the aim of maximizing the system capacity of HCRNs, the resource allocation problem is formulated as a joint multi-dimension optimization problem which includes network selection, bandwidth and power allocation for both multi-homing and single-network CRUs. However, the joint multi-dimension optimization leads the problem to be non-convex and NP-hard. To solve the problem efficiently, continuous relaxation is performed firstly, and next a near-optimal solution using Lagrangian dual decomposition and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions is proposed in this paper. Numerical results show the proposed algorithm improves the system capacity significantly compared to the traditional ones.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171083/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17416907","htmlLink":"/document/8171083/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint resource allocation for multi-homing and single-network users in heterogeneous cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint resource allocation for multi-homing and single-network users in heterogeneous cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078496S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171087,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Zhao","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086267939"},{"name":"Wenjun Xu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404292300"},{"name":"Xue Li","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications"],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Li","id":"37086264347"},{"name":"Jiaru Lin","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications"],"firstName":"Jiaru","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085365283"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171087","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","OFDM","Optimization","Wireless communication","5G mobile communication","Simulation","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["group theory","multicast communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["service-subcarrier association problem","social utility","user-interest-aware multicast group formation","OFDM networks","matching theory","communication calls","multicast groups","orthogonal frequency division multiple networks","two-step algorithm","user-service association","service-subcarrier association problems","power allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["user interest","multicast group formation","matching theory","power allocation","5G communication"]}],"abstract":"The emergence of 5G wireless communication calls for new paradigms to satisfy the individuation and diversification of users' demands. In this paper, we construct the multicast groups under the guidance of user interest and then allocate the subcarriers and power to these groups in orthogonal frequency division multiple (OFDM) networks. Specifically, in order to maximize the social utility related to user interest, a two-step algorithm is proposed: firstly, the multicast group formation which consists of user-service association and service-subcarrier association problems is conducted; in the second step, power allocation is determined by water-filling algorithm. We adopt the matching theory to solve the problem. Therein, the service-subcarrier association problem is formulated as a many-to-one matching while the sets of services and subcarriers are considered as players driven by their own benefit. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the social utility dramatically compared with the case taking no advantage of user interest.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171087","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171087.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User-interest-aware multicast group formation in OFDM networks using matching theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"User-interest-aware multicast group formation in OFDM networks using matching theory","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171087/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416903","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171087/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User-interest-aware multicast group formation in OFDM networks using matching theory","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078969S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171089,"authors":[{"name":"Yaxin Liu","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering"],"firstName":"Yaxin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086287659"},{"name":"Donglin Liu","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering"],"firstName":"Donglin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085650223"},{"name":"Xudong Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xudong","lastName":"Li","id":"37086288562"},{"name":"Chuan Huang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085780831"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171089","dbTime":"52 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"abstract":"Full-duplex (FD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems can achieve simultaneous transmission and reception at the same frequency. In this paper, the FD MIMO system, where the multi-tap (MT) canceller is adopted to eliminate the self-interference (SI) with imperfect SI channel state information, is studied. Considering the dynamic range of the analog-to-digital converter and the linearity of the receiver chain, the achievable signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the capacity of the FD MIMO system are both derived as a function of residual SI power after the MT cancellation. Simulation results show that the cancellation ability decreases as the tap delay alignment errors increase or the estimator signal-to-noise ratio reduces, which results in the loss of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the intended terminal. As a result, considering the linearity of the receiver, we demonstrate that the capacity of FD transceivers with the high transmit power suffers from significant rate gain loss conditioned on 1% tap delay alignment errors.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing

In this paper, we propose to utilize power allocation to mitigate the impact of imperfect SIC for a multiuser downlink NOMA system. In particular, we formulate a non-convex fractional programming problem with maximizing the system energy efficiency subject to a minimum data rate constraint for each user. To solve the intractable problem, we develop an iterative algorithm with a fast convergence speed. Simulation results validate that the proposed scheme can effectively alleviate the impact of imperfect SIC and achieve an obvious performance gain over two conventional baseline schemes.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171091","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171091.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient power allocation for non-orthogonal multiple access with imperfect successive interference cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient power allocation for non-orthogonal multiple access with imperfect successive interference cancellation","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171091/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416738","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171091/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient power allocation for non-orthogonal multiple access with imperfect successive interference cancellation","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129068S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171093,"authors":[{"name":"Yujie Lin","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yujie","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085771586"},{"name":"Qiang Ma","affiliation":["China Academy of Space Technology, Institute of Telecommunication Satellite, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086331932"},{"name":"Shuai Wang","affiliation":["China Academy of Space Technology, Institute of Telecommunication Satellite, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37899733100"},{"name":"Xiangyuan Bu","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiangyuan","lastName":"Bu","id":"37298628900"},{"name":"Jianping An","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"An","id":"37286060500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171093","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Phased arrays","Detectors","Receivers","Signal processing","Satellite antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","array signal processing","calibration","code division multiple access","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spaceborne phased array antennas","real-time antenna calibration","high performance digital beamforming","conventional antenna calibration","normal communication traffic","data satellite communications","online calibration method","code division multiple access satellite communication system","low-power calibration signals","orthogonal signature codes","normal communication signals","multiple access interference","iterative partial parallel interference cancellation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna calibration","calibration accuracy","interference cancellation","phased array"]}],"abstract":"For spaceborne phased arrays, real-time antenna calibration plays a critically important role.

In this paper, an online calibration method without interrupting satellite communications is proposed for transmitting phased array antennas in the code division multiple access (CDMA) satellite communication system. Low-power calibration signals which are modulated with orthogonal signature codes are simultaneously injected into all the chains along with normal communication signals. To eliminate the multiple access interference (MAI) imposed by communication signals, we employ iterative partial parallel interference cancellation (PPIC) algorithm.

Simulation results show that the obtained codes outperform other multiple-rate LDPC codes constructed from random row-splitting operations.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171095","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171095.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction of multiple-rate LDPC codes using modified PEG","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Construction of multiple-rate LDPC codes using modified PEG","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171095/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17416679","htmlLink":"/document/8171095/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of multiple-rate LDPC codes using modified PEG","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061243S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8171100,"authors":[{"name":"Jingjing Chen","affiliation":["College of Physics and Information Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Jingjing","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086263860"},{"name":"Zhonghui Chen","affiliation":["College of Physics and Information Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Zhonghui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086035969"},{"name":"Haifeng Zheng","affiliation":["College of Physics and Information Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37400957200"},{"name":"Xinxin Feng","affiliation":["College of Physics and Information Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Xinxin","lastName":"Feng","id":"37086002118"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171100","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"abstract":"High data quality and low sensing cost are two primary goals in large-scale mobile crowdsensing applications. The oversampling and the undersampling are common problems which always result in a high cost or low data quality that can not satisfy the system requirement. To address this problem, taking into account low-rank latent structure, we propose a compressive and adaptive data sampling scheme (CAS) which exploits adaptivity to identify locations which are highly informative for learning the low-dimensional space of the data matrix. In contrast to existing random sampling methods, it involves a three-pass sampling procedure that firstly assigns a fraction of samples to estimate general information, then samples those more informative locations for exact recovery and finally estimates the values of the unsensing locations. Evaluations on synthetic datasets and real datasets for air quality monitoring show the effectiveness of CAS. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to not only significantly improve the sensing data quality but also reduce the computation complexity comparing with the state-of-the-art matrix completion methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Mobile communication","Monitoring","Resource management","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","mobile computing","sampling methods","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive sampling approach","crowdsensing networks","large-scale mobile crowdsensing applications","data quality","compressive sampling approach","low-rank latent structure","sensing data quality","air quality monitoring","three-pass sampling procedure","random sampling methods","CAS","compressive data sampling scheme"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171100","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171100.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compressive and adaptive sampling approach in crowdsensing networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A compressive and adaptive sampling approach in crowdsensing networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171100/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171100/","accessionNumber":"17416831","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compressive and adaptive sampling approach in crowdsensing networks","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068782S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8171101,"authors":[{"name":"Yiran Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Peking University, Beijing, China","National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yiran","lastName":"Li","id":"37086318419"},{"name":"Xiang Cheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Peking University, Beijing, China","National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37399092900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171101","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":361},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Numerical models","Mathematical model","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Doppler effect","Analytical models","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","Doppler effect","MIMO communication","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical simulation models","nonisotropic UAV-MIMO channels","multiple-output narrowband channel","cylindrical model","corresponding deterministic simulation model","statistical simulation model","Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","Doppler power spectral density"]}],"abstract":"For simulations of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) narrowband channel between the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and the ground user, we describe the distribution of scatterers by using a cylindrical model, and propose a corresponding deterministic simulation model and a statistical simulation model.

To develop a robust beamformer against such an imperfection, a new approach is devised by formulating an output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) maximization problem. In particular, the proposed robust beamforming approach consists of two steps. At first, the standard Capon beamformer (SCB) is applied to find out the sidelobe notches and hence, a set of angles including the interference DOAs and the corresponding response levels can be determined. Next, the output SINR is maximized subject to a number of constraints on the response levels at the region of interest (ROI) and angles determined in the first step. In order to tackle the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, semidefinite relaxation techniques are thus employed to achieve an approximated solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed robust beamformer offers outstanding robustness against DOA mismatch, low sample size as well as the presence of the desired signal in the training samples.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171102.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust beamforming against direction-of-arrival mismatch via signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio maximization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171102/","displayDocTitle":"Robust beamforming against direction-of-arrival mismatch via signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio maximization","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416861","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust beamforming against direction-of-arrival mismatch via signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio maximization","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059409S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8171103,"authors":[{"name":"Yuqing Yuan","affiliation":["China provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing, Communication and Networking, Zhejiang University, China"],"firstName":"Yuqing","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085365394"},{"name":"Zhaoyang Zhang","affiliation":["China provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing, Communication and Networking, Zhejiang University, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279636300"},{"name":"Ji Cang","affiliation":["China provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing, Communication and Networking, Zhejiang University, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Cang","id":"37085354963"},{"name":"Huayang Wu","affiliation":["China provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing, Communication and Networking, Zhejiang University, China"],"firstName":"Huayang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085353232"},{"name":"Caijun Zhong","affiliation":["China provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing, Communication and Networking, Zhejiang University, China"],"firstName":"Caijun","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37391285800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171103","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Multiplexing","Receiving antennas","Antenna arrays","Transmitting antennas","Aperture antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular momentum","crosstalk","MIMO communication","multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication system","wireless communication system","multiinput multiouput technique","MIMO branch multiplexes","achievable sum-rate","array gain","OAM-MIMO system","pure MIMO","crosstalk","short distance communication scenario","orbital angular momentum capacity","degrees of freedom","DoF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orbital angular momentum","MIMO","wireless communication","sum-rate"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an orbit angular momentum (OAM) based wireless communication system combined with multi-input multi-ouput (MIMO) technique, where each MIMO branch multiplexes several OAM signals. The achievable sum-rate and array gain of the OAM-MIMO system relative to pure MIMO are analyzed. Results show that, when at near distance, e.g, the OAM beams are such collimated that each branch suffers little from crosstalk and power degradation, such an system merges the degrees of freedom (DoFs) provided by MIMO and OAM together, and thus provides higher sum-rate. However, as the transmission distance goes larger, though with more DoF, the performance advantages of OAM-MIMO disappears and may be even worse than pure MIMO due to fast power decay. Thus to enjoy the merits of incorporating MIMO into OAM entails a short distance communication scenario.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the capacity of an orbital angular momentum based MIMO communication system","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171103","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171103.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"On the capacity of an orbital angular momentum based MIMO communication system","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8171103/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416810","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the capacity of an orbital angular momentum based MIMO communication system","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057031S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171104,"authors":[{"name":"Weidong Shao","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Shao","id":"37086055720"},{"name":"Shun Zhang","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085821585"},{"name":"Hongyan Li","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hongyan","lastName":"Li","id":"37085382792"},{"name":"Jianpeng Ma","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jianpeng","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085409788"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171104","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interference","Discrete Fourier transforms","Downlink","Resource management","Multiplexing","5G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","MIMO communication","multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO networks","angle domain sparse code multiple access scheme","massive multiple-input multiple-output","ASCMA scheme","nonorthogonal transmission policy","sparse angle domain channel","angle domain mapping structure","optimal factor graph mapping strategy"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an angle domain sparse code multiple access (ASCMA) scheme for the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks to enhance the access connectivity.

In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure multi-authority attribute-based access control scheme for PHI in mHealth cloud. The proposed scheme simultaneously supports unbounded attribute universe and offers efficient decryption outsourcing approach without leaking the PHI privacy. It enables the PHI owner to define access policy in the form of any monotonic access structures. We prove the security in the standard model. Compared with relevant schemes, our scheme can reduce the user's decryption cost from increasing linearly with the number of attributes to constant.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171106","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171106.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-authority attribute-based access control scheme in mHealth cloud with unbounded attribute universe and decryption outsourcing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171106","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171106/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-authority attribute-based access control scheme in mHealth cloud with unbounded attribute universe and decryption outsourcing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416971","htmlLink":"/document/8171106/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-authority attribute-based access control scheme in mHealth cloud with unbounded attribute universe and decryption outsourcing","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073644S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171111,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxiang Liu","affiliation":["College of Communication and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086291346"},{"name":"Jing Zhang","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Wireless communications, Nanjing, China","College of Communication and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086286326"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171111","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":219},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Computational complexity","Chebyshev approximation","Algorithm design and analysis","Acceleration","Approximation algorithms","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","computational complexity","filtering theory","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","matrix algebra","matrix inversion","MIMO communication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection algorithm","massive MIMO system","minimum mean square error algorithm","near-optimal detection performance","matrix inversion","Chebyshev symmetrical successive over-relaxation iteration algorithm","channel hardening","MMSE algorithm","initial iteration value","iterative process","CSSOR algorithm","iterations","Neumann series approximation algorithm","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","Linear signal detection","Symmetric successive over-relaxation iteration","Chebyshev acceleration method"]}],"abstract":"The minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithm can achieve the near-optimal detection performance in Massive MIMO system.

In this paper, a Chebyshev symmetrical successive over-relaxation iteration algorithm (CSSOR) based on the characteristic of channel hardening in massive MIMO system is proposed to avoid matrix inversion, whose the computational complexity is reduced by about one order of magnitude compared to the MMSE algorithm. And the initial iteration value is also optimized based on the property of channel hardening to further quicken the convergence of the iterative process. The simulation results further verify that the CSSOR algorithm outperforms the newly proposed Neumann series approximation algorithm. Moreover, it converges fast, just with a few iterations it can achieves the near performance with the MMSE algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171111","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171111.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A signal detection algorithm based on chebyshev accelerated symmetrical successive over-relaxation iteration for massive MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A signal detection algorithm based on chebyshev accelerated symmetrical successive over-relaxation iteration for massive MIMO system","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171111/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416780","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171111/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A signal detection algorithm based on chebyshev accelerated symmetrical successive over-relaxation iteration for massive MIMO system","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053991S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171113,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["Departruent of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The Southern University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37071852300"},{"name":"Rui Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, China","Departruent of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The Southern University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292660400"},{"name":"Haisheng Tan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, The University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Haisheng","lastName":"Tan","id":"37085521481"},{"name":"Yifan Chen","affiliation":["Departruent of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The Southern University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281040000"},{"name":"Qingfeng Zhang","affiliation":["Departruent of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The Southern University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Qingfeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085341304"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171113","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uplink","Channel estimation","Interference","MIMO","Fading channels","Partial transmit sequences","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","MIMO communication","radio links","radiofrequency interference","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["strong interfering users","general analysis framework","uplink signal-to-interference ratio","complex system-level simulations","massive MIMO uplink transmission","system-level analysis","pilot extension scheme","cell users","service base stations","inter-cell interference","data transmission opportunity"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel pilot extension scheme is proposed for massive MIMO uplink transmission, and its performance is evaluated analytically. Specifically, we divide the cell users into two groups, namely near users and far users, according to their distances to the service base stations. The far users are more motivated to mitigate the inter-cell interference than the near users at the price of data transmission opportunity, it is proposed to schedule one more pilot sequence to each far user, and share the pilot knowledge of strong interfering users via backhauls. Then the interference from the latter can be mitigated significantly. We also develop a general analysis framework for both conventional and proposed schemes, where the bounds on the cumulative distribution function of the uplink signal-to-interference ratio are derived instead of complex system-level simulations. It is shown by numerical simulations that the analytical bounds are tight and the proposed scheme could effectively improve the uplink signal-to-interference ratio for far users. Besides, significantly throughput gain can also be achieved for far users with reasonable length of coherent fading block.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171113","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171113.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massive MIMO uplink transmission with pilot extension and system-level analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO uplink transmission with pilot extension and system-level analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171113/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416969","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171113/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive MIMO uplink transmission with pilot extension and system-level analysis","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076554S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171118,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjie Zhu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenjie","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086316726"},{"name":"Wenjin Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenjin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292856200"},{"name":"Xiao Li","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Li","id":"37086264351"},{"name":"Xiqi Gao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiqi","lastName":"Gao","id":"37277462600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171118","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the power allocation algorithm for beam division multiple access (BDMA) transmission in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications under Rician fading.

The objective function of ergodic sum-rate in the beam domain is a difference of concave functions, thus we search for the optimal solutions iteratively. We also utilize deterministic equivalent to calculate the ergodic sum-rate approximately under the assumption of only statistical channel state information (CSI) at the BS.

It is shown that the performance achieved under the non-linear energy harvesting model is better than that obtained under the linear energy harvesting mode.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171122","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171122.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective resource allocation in NOMA cognitive radios based on a practical non-linear energy harvesting model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171122/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective resource allocation in NOMA cognitive radios based on a practical non-linear energy harvesting model","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416695","htmlLink":"/document/8171122/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective resource allocation in NOMA cognitive radios based on a practical non-linear energy harvesting model","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390384.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087542S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171123,"authors":[{"name":"Xingxuan Zuo","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xingxuan","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37086272262"},{"name":"Jiankang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiankang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086271268"},{"name":"Xiaomin Mu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaomin","lastName":"Mu","id":"37287621700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171123","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Correlation","GSM","Modulation","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","cellular radio","error statistics","MIMO communication","modulation","space division multiplexing","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna grouping","massive MIMO systems","spatial modulation scheme","massive multiple-input-multiple-output","active antenna patterns","classical SM","spatial multiplexing gain","massive antennas","multiple active antennas","bit error ratio performance","grouping SM","transmitting antennas","single antenna","BS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["generalised spatial modulation (GSM)","spatial modulation (SM)","antenna grouping","massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an antenna grouping assisted spatial modulation scheme is proposed for massive MIMO systems. Massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems are capable of offering abundant spatial capacity by deploying hundreds of antennas at the base station (BS). Spatial modulation (SM) is one of the key technologies in exploiting spatial capacity, which maps the information bits to the active antenna patterns. However, the classical SM having only one radio frequency (RF) chain to be active significantly reduces the spatial multiplexing gain offered by massive antennas. Generalised spatial modulation (GSM) is an extension of SM, which allows several antennas to be active. With multiple active antennas, the throughout improves while the bit error ratio (BER) performance becomes poor. Thus, we propose an antenna grouping assisted spatial modulation, which is called as grouping SM (GrSM). Explicitly, the transmitting antennas are partitioned into multiple groups based on their channel characteristics and each group activates a single antenna for delivering signals. Furthermore, the upper bound of the BER of the proposed GrSM is also theoretically analyzed. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed GrSM in terms of achievable BER performance with same bit rate in comparison with SM and GSM.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171123","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171123.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna grouping assisted spatial modulation for massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171123/","displayDocTitle":"Antenna grouping assisted spatial modulation for massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416685","htmlLink":"/document/8171123/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna grouping assisted spatial modulation for massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049341S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171124,"authors":[{"name":"Mengting Wu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.

Although the DCO-FBMC scheme supports fully asynchronized multi-user uplink transmission and has been proven to have higher spectral and power efficiency than direct current biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM), its achievable data rates, the fundamental performance metric from information theory perspective, has not been fully unveiled. In this paper, we study the uplink achievable rate and region of the DCO-FBMC system for OWC. Because of the low cost implementation of the realistic OWC system, we consider using low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) instead of full-resolution ADCs at the receiver, and study its impact on the achievable rate of the DCO-FBMC system. Simulation results indicate that although using low-resolution ADCs causes loss of system achievable rate, the performance of the 4-bit quantized DCO-FBMC system is very close to that of the full-resolution DCO-FBMC system. In addition, compared with DCO-OFBM, the maximum achievable rate of each user in DCO-FBMC system is larger. Moreover, the DCO-FBMC system with 4-bit quantization gets larger achievable rate region than the full-resolution DCO-OFDM system, especially in the case of oversampling. Therefore, our paper show that from the achievable rate perspective, using the DCO-FBMC system with low-resolution ADCs is a good candidate for optical wireless communication.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171124","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171124.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable rate of DCO-FBMC with low-resolution ADCs for optical wireless communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Achievable rate of DCO-FBMC with low-resolution ADCs for optical wireless communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171124/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416721","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171124/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable rate of DCO-FBMC with low-resolution ADCs for optical wireless communication","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133459S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171125,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086230171"},{"name":"Gongpu Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gongpu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404549100"},{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289304900"},{"name":"Yulong Zou","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and Transmission, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Yulong","lastName":"Zou","id":"37534410900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171125","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":383},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backscatter","Channel estimation","Wireless communication","Detectors","Receiving antennas","Signal detection","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backscatter","channel estimation","interference suppression","maximum likelihood detection","radio networks","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ambient backscatter device","channel estimation error","signal detection","environmental wireless signals","full duplex wireless system","battery-free devices","self-interference cancellation","transmit antenna antenna","receive antenna","maximum likelihood detector","system throughput maximization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ambient backscatter","bit error rate","channel estimation error","full duplex wireless communication","ML detection","throughput"]}],"abstract":"Ambient backscatter is a new technology that utilizes environmental wireless signals to enable battery-free devices to communicate with each other.

In this paper, by incorporating the graceful rate-splitting (RS) techniques, the user paring and power control issues in power domain NOMA systems are successfully resolved. Subsequently, we incorporate RS into the design of a code domain NOMA scheme.

According to the ray-tracing model, the mm-wave channel estimation problem can be solved by converting into the estimation of parameters including the angles of departure (AOD), the angles of arrival (AOA) and the path gains. In order to separate different paths in the mm-wave channel, interference cancellation is carried out by utilizing a designed set of spread codes. Then the DOA estimation and the least-squares method are used to achieve the path directions and gains, respectively. Compared with estimating all the paths directions simultaneously, simulation results show that the combination of IC and MUSIC can get lower root mean square error (RMSE). Meanwhile, the algorithm can get high resolution in directional spectrum because the proposed method can suppress the additive noise in the mm-wave channel effectively.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171136","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171136.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter-wave channel estimation with interference cancellation and DOA estimation in hybrid massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171136/","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-wave channel estimation with interference cancellation and DOA estimation in hybrid massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416818","htmlLink":"/document/8171136/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-wave channel estimation with interference cancellation and DOA estimation in hybrid massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390522.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067191S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171137,"authors":[{"name":"Jiayin Li","affiliation":["College of Physics and Information Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Jiayin","lastName":"Li","id":"37086278401"},{"name":"Haifeng Zheng","affiliation":["College of Physics and Information Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37400957200"},{"name":"Xinxin Feng","affiliation":["College of Physics and Information Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Xinxin","lastName":"Feng","id":"37086002118"},{"name":"Zhonghui Chen","affiliation":["College of Physics and Information Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Zhonghui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086035969"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171137","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"abstract":"The recent advances of compressive sensing (CS) have witnessed a great potential of traffic condition estimation in road networks.

Most of the prior work on hybrid beamforming considers frequency-flat channels. However, in practice, thanks to the large amount of available spectral resource, mmWave communication systems are expected to be broadband with frequency selective channels. In this paper, we focus on the design of the energy efficient transmission for broadband mmWave MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems. A low complexity optimization algorithm is proposed to calculate the hybrid radio frequency (analog) and baseband (digital) precoding matrices. Extensive numerical results are provided to evaluate the energy efficiency performance of the system and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171144.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient hybrid precoding for broadband millimeter wave communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171144/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient hybrid precoding for broadband millimeter wave communication systems","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416740","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient hybrid precoding for broadband millimeter wave communication systems","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063397S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171148,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Han","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Han","id":"37086334637"},{"name":"Jun Tong","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Tong","id":"37085574901"},{"name":"Qinghua Guo","affiliation":["University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, AU"],"firstName":"Qinghua","lastName":"Guo"},{"name":"Jiangtao Xi","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong"],"firstName":"Jiangtao","lastName":"Xi","id":"37273716500"},{"name":"Yanguang Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong"],"firstName":"Yanguang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085657298"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171148","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"abstract":"This paper studies the channel estimation and equalisation of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems over doubly selective channels.

Simulation results show that our proposed method achieves a significantly higher spectrum sensing performance than the random allocation scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171150.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal energy harvesting-aided spectrum sensing sensors scheduling in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171150/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal energy harvesting-aided spectrum sensing sensors scheduling in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416766","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal energy harvesting-aided spectrum sensing sensors scheduling in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390690.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084919S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171155,"authors":[{"name":"Chunmei Yao","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Lab of Wireless Communication Technologies, Shandong Univiersity, Jinan, Shandong, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Chunmei","lastName":"Yao","id":"37086288010"},{"name":"Jian Song","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Lab of Wireless Communication Technologies, Shandong Univiersity, Jinan, Shandong, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Song","id":"37086292675"},{"name":"Wensheng Zhang","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Lab of Wireless Communication Technologies, Shandong Univiersity, Jinan, Shandong, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Wensheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086295110"},{"name":"Xiaotian Zhou","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Lab of Wireless Communication Technologies, Shandong Univiersity, Jinan, Shandong, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Xiaotian","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086290984"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171155","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an advanced polar encoding scheme with successive cancellation list (SCL) decoder for visible light communication (VLC).

single-antenna receivers. Considering the imperfect channel state information (CSI), we study the joint optimization of transmit beamforming vectors, covariance of artificial noise, and power splitting ratios so as to minimize the total transmit power while satisfying the worst-case conservative secrecy rate and energy harvesting constraints. The original optimization is non-convex and intractable in general. To handle this challenge, in this paper, we first derive the exact upper or lower bounds of the constraints in original optimization problem by using the Lagrangian approach, and then convert the corresponding non-convex problem into a convex one with the aid of the rank relaxation technique. Finally, we provide simulation results to illustrate the robustness of the proposed design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171158/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17416786","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171158/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust secure beamforming for MISO SWIPT broadcast channels with confidential messages","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust secure beamforming for MISO SWIPT broadcast channels with confidential messages","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570390782.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074809S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171159,"authors":[{"name":"Yuehong Guo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, CHINA"],"firstName":"Yuehong","lastName":"Guo","id":"37086311126"},{"name":"Lixin Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, CHINA"],"firstName":"Lixin","lastName":"Li","id":"37086305511"},{"name":"Xiaocong Wen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, CHINA"],"firstName":"Xiaocong","lastName":"Wen","id":"37086311869"},{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, CHINA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086278641"},{"name":"Zhu Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Han","id":"37278605300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171159","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":455},"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the downlink of millimeter-wave multi-user massive MIMO systems, and propose a hybrid precoding scheme based on a sub-array architecture to achieve a better compromise between hardware cost and system performance.

In order to reduce the pilot overhead, we propose a decoupling pilot design scheme. The proposed pilot design scheme fully utilizes the channel sparsity in delay-angle domain which caused by the small amount of scatterers in the physical propagation environment. By exploiting the joint sparsity, the pilot design is decoupled into two domains. In angle domain, random Rademacher distribution pilot matrix is adopted. In delay domain, a two-layer greedy iterative (TLGI) algorithm is proposed to obtain the near-optimal pilot subcarrier pattern. Simulation results verify that the proposed pilot design scheme achieves the similar performance with half of the pilot overhead compared with the random pilot pattern.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171165","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171165.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot design for FDD massive MIMO systems with channel sparsity in delay-angle domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171165/","displayDocTitle":"Pilot design for FDD massive MIMO systems with channel sparsity in delay-angle domain","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416921","htmlLink":"/document/8171165/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot design for FDD massive MIMO systems with channel sparsity in delay-angle domain","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570391372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093163S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171169,"authors":[{"name":"Boyang Liu","affiliation":["Xi an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi an, China"],"firstName":"Boyang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086031185"},{"name":"Guangyue Lu","affiliation":["Xi an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi an, China"],"firstName":"Guangyue","lastName":"Lu","id":"37288863600"},{"name":"Zan Li","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xi an, China"],"firstName":"Zan","lastName":"Li","id":"37279082100"},{"name":"Fuhui Zhou","affiliation":["Nanchang University, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Fuhui","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085422179"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171169","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"abstract":"Energy efficient cognitive radio networks can simultaneously improve spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) of wireless communication networks.

We employ feedback messages to terminate the user retransmission process, and use successive interference cancellation (SIC) for packet recovery. We evaluate the number of transmissions per user (NTU) of the proposed protocol, and show that a very small amount of feedback messages from the receiver can significantly reduce NTU. Thus, it can prolong the service life of user equipments.

An erroneous estimation of the SNR at the decoder is referred to as \u201cSNR mismatch\u201d. SNR mismatch can significantly degrade the BP decoding performance of LT codes. In this paper, we propose a semi-Gaussian approximation method to predict and compare the asymptotic performance of LT codes under SNR mismatch. Asymptotic analysis and simulation results show that LT codes are more sensitive to SNR over-estimation and under-estimation for small and large SNR offset, respectively. We also show that the improved LT codes which shape the degree distribution of information nodes to lower error floor are more sensitive to SNR mismatch than original LT codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171172/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17416765","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171172/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis for decoding LT codes over BIAWGN channels with SNR mismatch","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis for decoding LT codes over BIAWGN channels with SNR mismatch","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570391794.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073345S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171176,"authors":[{"name":"Huiling Zuo","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Mobile Network Technologies, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huiling","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37085822145"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Tao","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Mobile Network Technologies, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Tao","id":"37288199300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171176","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1349},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Resource management","Uplink","Gain","Interference","Optimization","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","convex programming","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NOMA group","hybrid NOMA system","sum-throughput maximization problem","total transmission power","convex optimization problem","optimal power allocation","power allocation scheme","power allocation optimization","uplink nonorthogonal multiple access systems","user fairness","spectral efficiency","5G wireless communication networks","minimum rate requirements","Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions","KKT conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access","power allocation","convex optimization","throughput"]}],"abstract":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is a promising multiple access technique for 5G wireless communication networks due to its higher spectral efficiency and user fairness.

In our system, each user applies the optimum power splitting (PS), in order to coordinate the energy harvesting and information decoding at the receiver. The optimization problem is formulated as the optimal power allocation (PA) and PS ratio selection, to maximize the secrecy sum rate (SSR) of the NOMA system under the constraints on the individual user's minimum rate and harvested power. In order to derive the solutions to the optimization problem, we separate the PS ratio selection from the PA problem. We first solve to get the closed-form expressions for the optimal PS ratios. Based on the PS ratios obtained, the PA is converted to a convex optimization problem, from which we obtain the optimal PA. Finally, we study the performance based on simulations, our simulation results show that the systems with optimal PA and PS ratio significantly outperform the legacy systems with uniform PA and fixed PS ratio.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171177/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8171177/","accessionNumber":"17416683","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy sum rate maximization in NOMA systems with wireless information and power transfer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrecy sum rate maximization in NOMA systems with wireless information and power transfer","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570391970.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066051S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8171178,"authors":[{"name":"Haixia Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Haixia","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086306990"},{"name":"Rongpeng Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Rongpeng","lastName":"Li","id":"38517911000"},{"name":"Lu Fan","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Fan","id":"37086100840"},{"name":"Honggang Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Honggang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280788800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171178","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1231},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171178","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Servers","Genetic algorithms","Computational modeling","Optimization","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","delays","genetic algorithms","minimisation","mobile computing","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay optimization","mobile-edge computing systems","MEC","important paradigm","cache resources","core networks","edge network","data center","DC","computation offloading","data caching model","execution delay","transmission delay","delay minimization problem","computational resources","genetic algorithm","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile edge computing","computation offloading","execution delay","data caching","transmission delay"]}],"abstract":"Mobile edge computing (MEC) has recently emerged as an important paradigm to bring computation and cache resources to the edge of core networks. However, the resources of edge network are relatively limited, so it is necessary to cooperate with data center (DC) which has sufficient computational resources. In this paper, we aim at designing a computation offloading and data caching model under the joint of MEC and DC. Then, by analyzing the execution delay and transmission delay of each task, we formulate a resource-constrained delay minimization problem, and put forward a heuristic algorithm based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA). Numerical results show that our scheme outperforms the conventional schemes in various scenarios, and also verify that the proposed algorithm can converge to a superior value than the classical GA and SA algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171178","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171178.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171178","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint computation offloading and data caching with delay optimization in mobile-edge computing systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint computation offloading and data caching with delay optimization in mobile-edge computing systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8171178/","accessionNumber":"17416968","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint computation offloading and data caching with delay optimization in mobile-edge computing systems","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570391975.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065821S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171179,"authors":[{"name":"Xixi Jin","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xixi","lastName":"Jin","id":"37086331770"},{"name":"Lei Xie","affiliation":["Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing, Communication and Networking, Hangzhou, China","College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Xie","id":"37274139400"},{"name":"Huifang Chen","affiliation":["Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing, Communication and Networking, Hangzhou, China","College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huifang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293466200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171179","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Channel state information","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cognitive radio","error statistics","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","optimisation","quality of experience","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoE-aware resource allocation scheme","OFDMA","cognitive radio network","imperfect CSI consideration","video streaming service","CRN","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","channel estimation error","primary receivers","probabilistic interference constraint model","secondary receivers","achievable rate","minimum rate constraint","maximum rate constraint","resource allocation problem","system throughput","optimization problem","quality of experience","outage probability","secondary transmitters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resource allocation","Quality of experience (QoE)","Cognitive radio network","imperfect channel state information"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation for the video streaming service in the cognitive radio network (CRN) based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA).

With imperfect CSI between STx and secondary receivers (SRx), the achievable rate of SRx is derived by introducing the outage probability of subchannels. To guarantee the quality of experience (QoE) of service and the fairness of resource allocation among SRx, the minimum rate constraint and the maximum rate constraint are set for resource allocation problem, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a three-hop secure Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmission protocol for the wireless networks with untrusted relays. In the proposed protocol, instead of exploiting the degree of freedom over spatial domain in multi-antenna systems, the transmission is secured through single-antenna small wireless devices by the use of multiple sub-carriers in frequency. With the objective to maximize the security rate, we formulate the optimal problem for sub-carrier power distribution and time-domain artificial noise design. Since this problem is non-convex, we further approximate and reformulate it into a train of convex problems through relaxation. By solving the relaxed problem, we design an iterative power distribution and time-domain artificial noise scheme for the proposed three-hop protocol. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol is robust to untrusted relays and can achieves higher secrecy rate compared with the existing two-hop OFDM secure transmission protocols.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171185","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171185.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure OFDM transmission in wireless networks with untrusted relays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secure OFDM transmission in wireless networks with untrusted relays","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171185/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416840","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171185/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure OFDM transmission in wireless networks with untrusted relays","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570392108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.14595S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171186,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37068257400"},{"name":"Pingping Xu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Pingping","lastName":"Xu","id":"37269796700"},{"name":"Yuan Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086262848"},{"name":"Hongyun Chu","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Hongyun","lastName":"Chu","id":"37086233912"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2062-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2061-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2063-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"8171186","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":512},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171186","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless fidelity","Integrated circuits","Adaptive systems","Nickel","Markov processes","Downlink","3GPP"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","radio spectrum management","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LAA system","CW size","dynamic CW adjustment scheme","flexible Initial Clear-Channel Assessment procedure","information exchange","special inter-system coordinations","adaptive LAA-LBT scheme","LAA contention window size","existing adaptive LBT methods","LAA devices","flexible LBT strategy","Licensed-Assisted Access framework","clear channel assessment","listen-Before-Talk","downlink LAA-WiFi coexistence","network-sensitive adaptive LAA LBT strategy","WiFi system","LAA detection"]}],"abstract":"Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) is the clear channel assessment (CCA) check method of Licensed-Assisted Access (LAA) framework.

from ambient environment. Jointly considering the primary user activity on the primary channel, diversity of channel conditions, energy replenishment process as well as the imperfection of spectrum sensing, the SU aims to maximize the total throughput in a finite horizon time slots by jointly optimizing the spectrum sensing as well as the transmit power. We formulate the above design problem as a finite-horizon sequential decision process, and propose an optimal policy through using the dynamic programming.

A new localization method based on two satellites for the interference source is proposed in this paper. By combining two localization parameters named time difference of arrival (TDOA) between two satellites and the direction of arrival(DOA) from the main satellite, the three-dimensional locations of the interference source can be achieved. The three-dimensional mathematical localization model for the interference source is established with the vector solution method. Moreover, in Monte Carlo analysis, the localization error model is established in consideration of many error factors.

We consider the scenario where a source communicates with a legitimate UAV in the presence of a full-duplex eavesdropper. We assume that the full-duplex eavesdropper performs both eavesdropping and malicious jamming simultaneously. In order to safeguard data transmissions against such an eavesdropper, the source transmits artificial noise (AN) signals together with information signals. We adopt the hybrid outage probability as the performance metric, which combines the transmission outage probability and the secrecy outage probability. We derive a compact expression for the hybrid outage probability. Using the derived expression, we determine the optimal power allocation factor between information signals and AN signals that minimizes the hybrid outage probability. In addition, we examine the impact of the operating height of UAV on the secrecy performance, showing that the optimal secrecy performance can be achieved by judiciously controlling the height of UAV.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171198","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123608/8170872/08171198.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure UAV communication in the presence of active eavesdropper (invited paper)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Secure UAV communication in the presence of active eavesdropper (invited paper)","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416730","htmlLink":"/document/8171198/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure UAV communication in the presence of active eavesdropper (invited paper)","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570396245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068903S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123608","isNumber":"8170872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123608","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8170872","articleId":"8171198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8171200,"authors":[{"name":"Chenggui Lou","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, Guangdong, P.R.

Our methodology exploits the joint sparsity of the mmWave MIMO channel in the angle and delay domains. We formulate the estimation problem as a noisy quantized compressed-sensing problem and solve it using efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms. In particular, we model the angle-delay coefficients using a Bernoulli-Gaussian-mixture distribution with unknown parameters and use the expectation-maximization forms of the generalized AMP and vector AMP algorithms to simultaneously learn the distributional parameters and compute approximately minimum mean-squared error (MSE) estimates of the channel coefficients. We design a training sequence that allows fast, fast Fourier transform based implementation of these algorithms while minimizing peak-to-average power ratio at the transmitter, making our methods scale efficiently to large numbers of antenna elements and delays. We present the results of a detailed simulation study that compares our algorithms to several benchmarks. Our study investigates the effect of SNR, training length, training type, ADC resolution, and runtime on channel estimation MSE, mutual information, and achievable rate. It shows that, in a mmWave MIMO system, the methods we propose to exploit joint angle-delay sparsity allow 1-bit ADCs to perform comparably to infinite-bit ADCs at low SNR, and 4-bit ADCs to perform comparably to infinite-bit ADCs at medium SNR.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2781644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8269342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2781644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8269342/08171203.pdf","startPage":"1141","endPage":"1154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation in Broadband Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems With Few-Bit ADCs","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/8269342/8171203-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation in Broadband Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems With Few-Bit ADCs","volume":"66","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1, 1 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 January 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8171203/","publicationDate":"1 March1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17524197","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171203/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1527079 and CCF-1527162"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Channel Estimation in Broadband Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems With Few-Bit ADCs","sourcePdf":"tsp-heath-2781644-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172276S","chronDate":"March1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8269342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"8269342","articleId":"8171203","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8171204,"authors":[{"name":"Wiem Housseyni","affiliation":["National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology, University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia","School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jinan University (Zhuhai Campus), Zhuhai, China","Tunisia Polytechnic School, University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8171204/houss-2781459-small.gif","p":["Wiem Housseyni was born in Tunis, Tunisia, in 1989.

Reconfigurable computing systems have to deal with unpredictable events from the environment, such as activation of new tasks and hardware or software failures, by adapting the task allocation and scheduling in order to maintain the system feasibility and performance. The proposed approach is based on an intelligent multiagent distributed architecture composed of: 1) a global agent \u201ccoordinator\u201dassociated with the whole distributed system and 2) four local agents, such as supervisor, scheduler, battery manager, and reconfiguration manager, belong to each subsystem. The efficiency and completeness of the reconfiguration adaptative strategy is proved as all possible reconfiguration forms are considered to guarantee a feasible system with a graceful quality of service. Two communication protocols, such as an intra-subsystem communication protocol and an inter-subsystem communication protocol, are proposed to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed reconfiguration strategy. Extensive simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent multiagent distributed architecture in terms of the number of exchanged messages, deadline success ratio, and the energy consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","xploreNote":"As originally submitted and published there is an error in this document.

However, the drawback of NB-LDPC decoders is high complexity, especially for the check node unit (CNU), and the complexity increases considerably when increasing the Galois-field (GF) order. In this paper, a novel basic-set trellis min-max algorithm is proposed to greatly reduce not only the CNU complexity but also the number of messages exchanged between the check node and the variable node compared with previous studies, which is highly efficient for higher order GFs. In addition, the proposed CNU is designed to compute the messages in a parallel way. Layered decoder architectures based on the proposed algorithm were implemented for the (837, 726) NB-LDPC code over GF(32) and the (1512, 1323) code over GF(64) using 90-nm CMOS technology, and obtained a reduction in the complexity by 30% and 37% for the CNU, and 40% and 37.4% for the whole decoder, respectively.

However, DNN models, especially a convolutional neural network (CNN), usually involve massive parameters and are computationally expensive, making them extremely dependent on high-performance hardware. This prohibits their further extensions, e.g., applications on mobile devices. In this paper, we present a quantized CNN, a unified approach to accelerate and compress convolutional networks. Guided by minimizing the approximation error of individual layer's response, both fully connected and convolutional layers are carefully quantized. The inference computation can be effectively carried out on the quantized network, with much lower memory and storage consumption. Quantitative evaluation on two publicly available benchmarks demonstrates the promising performance of our approach: with comparable classification accuracy, it achieves 4 to 6\u00d7 acceleration and 15 to 20\u00d7 compression. With our method, accurate image classification can even be directly carried out on mobile devices within 1 s.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171208/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","volume":"29","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2018","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18095306","pubMedId":"29990226","htmlLink":"/document/8171208/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Quantized CNN: A Unified Approach to Accelerate and Compress Convolutional Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61332016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002888","fundingName":"Beijing Municipal Commission of Education","grantNumber":"KZ201610005012"},{"fundingName":"Fund of Hubei Key Laboratory of Transportation Internet of Things"},{"fundingName":"Fund of Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantized CNN: A Unified Approach to Accelerate and Compress Convolutional Networks","sourcePdf":"tnnls-cheng-2774288-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1228S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8468244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8468244","articleId":"8171208","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8171210,"authors":[{"name":"Jahoon Jin","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8300457/8171210/jjin-2773642-small.gif","p":["Jahoon Jin (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea, in 2013, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include analog/ mixed-signal design and behavior modeling for high-speed serial links, especially the referenceless clock and data recovery circuit, an equalization adaptation technique, a data path, and an I/O design.","Mr. Jin received the Institute of Electronics and Information Engineers Workshop on RF/Analog Circuit Best Paper Award in 2014."]},"firstName":"Jahoon","lastName":"Jin","orcid":"0000-0001-7012-9991","id":"37086053248"},{"name":"Seok Kim","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea","Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8300457/8171210/kim-2773642-small.gif","p":["Seok Kim received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea, in 2009 and 2014, respectively.","From 2014 to 2016, he was with Samsung Electronics, Hwasung, South Korea, where he was involved in high-speed design for testability circuits for high bandwidth memory.

A special measurement system is at first set up to get reliability of the bonding wire array, where a microscope is used to capture its fractures. The temperature distribution of the LDMOSFET die surface and bonding wire array is also captured by a thermal infrared scanner to investigate the principle underlying the failure of ETS fractures. Simulation studies are also performed. The temperature distribution is closely related to the profiles of the bonding wire array. Numerical methods are employed to calculate the bonding wire array, and the temperature distributions are demonstrated by using our finite-element method code. It also works well in solving the transient temperature of the bond wire array with the stationary current and the heat source from the silicon region. The simulated thermal results agree well with the testing results. Finally, an improved LDMOS design in optimizing the bonding wire profile is proposed. This research can serve as a guide for the design of an LDMOS PA with enhanced reliability.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2017.2773624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2017.2773624","startPage":"1032","endPage":"1041","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/8375025/08171214.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8375025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ruggedness Characterization of Bonding Wire Arrays in LDMOSFET-Based Power Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","displayDocTitle":"Ruggedness Characterization of Bonding Wire Arrays in LDMOSFET-Based Power Amplifiers","publicationDate":"June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2018","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8171214/","accessionNumber":"17822118","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171214/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61431014 and 61234001"},{"fundingName":"NSAF","grantNumber":"U1530121"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003399","fundingName":"Shanghai Science and Technology Commission","grantNumber":"15511105200"},{"fundingName":"Science Challenge Project","grantNumber":"JCKY2016212A502"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005156","fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellowship of Germany"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ruggedness Characterization of Bonding Wire Arrays in LDMOSFET-Based Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-zhou-2773624-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094335S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"8375025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8375025","articleId":"8171214","onlineDate":"08 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8171272,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Leonardi","affiliation":["University of Rome Tor Vergata, Electronic Engineering, Roma, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Leonardi","id":"37545148000"},{"name":"Emilio Piracci","affiliation":["University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy","Rheinmetall Italia s.p.a., Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Emilio","lastName":"Piracci","id":"37660024500"},{"name":"Gaspare Galati","affiliation":["University of Rome Tor Vergata, Electronic Engineering, Roma, Italy"],"firstName":"Gaspare","lastName":"Galati","id":"37299455300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8985"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-959X"}],"articleNumber":"8171272","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":546},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Receivers","Air traffic control","Broadcasting","Surveillance","Transponders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air traffic control","aircraft","jamming","surveillance","transponders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ADS-B transponder","air traffic control","all cooperating aircraft","air traffic management system","automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast system","multichannel receiver","ADS-B jamming mitigation"]}],"abstract":"The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system is one of the major surveillance systems for air traffic management, providing identity, position, and status information of all cooperating aircraft.

Despite the importance of ADS-B, it has been developed without security considerations and is subject to various types of attacks. A trustworthy ADS-B system will make the NextGen system more reliable and make air transportation safer. But current safety measures are inadequate and many research proposals are not yet practical or cost-effective. We developed a practical method that can reject virtually all spoofed ADS-B messages by monitoring the signal propagation time between senders and receivers. To measure the actual propagation time, the method uses a small timestamp value; hence, we call it \"ADS-B with Timestamp\" (ADS-BT). ADS-BT monitors the discrepancy between the time of flight based on the timestamp values and the time of flight based on the location data. In spoofed ADSB messages, the discrepancy between the two diverges over time, which allows us to identify spoofed ADS-B messages accurately.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171273/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"November 2017","accessionNumber":"17415039","volume":"32","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"ADS-B vulnerabilities and a security solution with a timestamp","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ADS-B vulnerabilities and a security solution with a timestamp","sourcePdf":"52-61_aesm-32-11-52.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087264S","chronDate":"November  2017","xplore-pub-id":"62","isNumber":"8171240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"62","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8171240","articleId":"8171273","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8171281,"authors":[{"name":"Attilio Belmonte","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Attilio","lastName":"Belmonte","id":"37944533000"},{"name":"Ludovic Goux","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ludovic","lastName":"Goux","id":"37293864600"},{"name":"Jiyong Woo","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea","IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jiyong","lastName":"Woo","id":"38237318200"},{"name":"Umberto Celano","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Umberto","lastName":"Celano","id":"37085351814"},{"name":"Augusto Redolfi","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Augusto","lastName":"Redolfi","id":"38483626400"},{"name":"Sergiu Clima","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Sergiu","lastName":"Clima","id":"37568184200"},{"name":"Gouri Sankar Kar","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Gouri Sankar","lastName":"Kar","id":"38235627500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0477-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0478-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8171281","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":388},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Electrodes","Ions","Performance evaluation","Aluminum oxide","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copper","integrated circuit modelling","random-access storage","solid electrolytes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conductive filament","memory window","operating current","quantum-point-contact model","switching operation","filament constriction","optimal switching control","low-voltage switching","CBRAM performance","hourglass-shaped filament","performance enhancement","solid electrolyte","copper mobility","writing speed","filament configuration","CBRAM devices","conductive-bridge random access memory","current 10.0 muA","time 10.0 ns","voltage 3.0 V","voltage 0.5 V","Cu"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RRAM","Conductive-bridging","CBRAM","QPC","Al2O3","WO3","low-current"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171281","doi":"10.1109/NVMTS.2017.8171281","publicationTitle":"2017 17th Non-Volatile Memory Technology Symposium (NVMTS)","abstract":"In this paper, we outline the performance enhancement at low current (10 \u03bcA) introduced by implementing CBRAM devices were the solid electrolyte is made of two layers with different Cu mobility, enabling to form a hourglass-shaped conductive filament.

There is a significant interest in developing non-von Neumann coprocessors for the training of ANNs, where resistive memory devices serve as synaptic elements. However, interdevice variability, limited dynamic range and resolution, nonlinearity and asymmetric switching characteristics pose important technical challenges. We investigate the use of multi-memristive synapses to overcome these challenges. We present a detailed experimental characterization of conductance changes using a phase-change memory chip fabricated in the 90nm technology node and show how multi-memrisive synapses can address the limitations of memristive devices for synaptic implementations. Simulations show that an ANN trained with backpropagation can achieve competitive classification accuracies using such a scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2017-Sept. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171302/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8171302/","accessionNumber":"17417247","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An efficient synaptic architecture for artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient synaptic architecture for artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"Boybat.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066042S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2017-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8124862","isNumber":"8171277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8124862","xplore-issue":"8171277","articleId":"8171302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8171303,"authors":[{"name":"Wenlong Cai","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, P.R.

To avoid such interference, the SU is required to sense the medium for a period of time and eventually use it only if the band is perceived to be idle. In this context, the encryption process is carried out for the SU requests prior to their transmission whilst the strength of the security in CRNs is directly proportional to the length of the encryption key. If a request of a PU on arrival finds an SU request being either encrypted or transmitted, then the SU is preempted from service. However, excessive sensing time for the detection of free spectrum by SUs as well as extended periods of the CRN being at an insecure state have an adverse impact on network performance. To this end, a generalized stochastic Petri net (GSPN) is proposed in order to investigate sensing vs. security vs. performance trade-offs, leading to an efficient use of the spectrum band. Typical numerical simulation experiments are carried out, based on the application of the Mobius Petri Net Package and associated interpretations are made.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17417759","htmlLink":"/document/8171335/","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Combined sensing, performance and security trade-offs in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined sensing, performance and security trade-offs in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04795S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125635","isNumber":"8171314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125635","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8171314","articleId":"8171335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8171350,"authors":[{"name":"Corentin Hardy","affiliation":["Technicolor, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Corentin","lastName":"Hardy","id":"37086301750"},{"name":"Erwan Le Merrer","affiliation":["Technicolor, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Erwan","lastName":"Le Merrer","id":"37085712586"},{"name":"Bruno Sericola","affiliation":["Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Sericola","id":"37294082700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1465-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1464-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1466-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8171350","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1357},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Computational modeling","Machine learning","Data models","Training","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","gradient methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","Linux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge-devices","data mining","analytic services","high-end servers","personal devices","machine learning operations","deep learning computation","efficient gradient selection","learning rate modulation","device heterogeneity","CPU cycles","device reliability","TensorFlow","Linux containers","convolutional network","MNIST dataset","standard asynchronous stochastic gradient descent","GPUs","datacenters","AdaComp"]}],"abstract":"A large portion of data mining and analytic services use modern machine learning techniques, such as deep learning. The state-of-the-art results by deep learning come at the price of an intensive use of computing resources. The leading frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow) are executed on GPUs or on high-end servers in datacenters. On the other end, there is a proliferation of personal devices with possibly free CPU cycles; this can enable services to run in users' homes, embedding machine learning operations. In this paper, we ask the following question: Is distributed deep learning computation on WAN connected devices feasible, in spite of the traffic caused by learning tasks? We show that such a setup rises some important challenges, most notably the ingress traffic that the servers hosting the up-to-date model have to sustain. In order to reduce this stress, we propose AdaComp, a novel algorithm for compressing worker updates to the model on the server. Applicable to stochastic gradient descent based approaches, it combines efficient gradient selection and learning rate modulation. We then experiment and measure the impact of compression, device heterogeneity and reliability on the accuracy of learned models, with an emulator platform that embeds TensorFlow into Linux containers. We report a reduction of the total amount of data sent by workers to the server by two order of magnitude (e.g., 191-fold reduction for a convolutional network on the MNIST dataset), when compared to a standard asynchronous stochastic gradient descent, while preserving model accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/NCA.2017.8171350","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125635/8171314/08171350.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8171314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCA.2017.8171350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed deep learning on edge-devices: Feasibility via adaptive compression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2017-Nov. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Distributed deep learning on edge-devices: Feasibility via adaptive compression","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171350/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17417756","htmlLink":"/document/8171350/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed deep learning on edge-devices: Feasibility via adaptive compression","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096986S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125635","isNumber":"8171314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125635","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8171314","articleId":"8171350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8171359,"authors":[{"name":"Adila Mebrek","affiliation":["ERA/ICD - UMR CNRS 6281, University of Technology of Troyes, TROYES CEDEX, France"],"firstName":"Adila","lastName":"Mebrek","id":"37086282525"},{"name":"Leila Merghem-Boulahia","affiliation":["ERA/ICD - UMR CNRS 6281, University of Technology of Troyes, TROYES CEDEX, France"],"firstName":"Leila","lastName":"Merghem-Boulahia","id":"38275864800"},{"name":"Moez Esseghir","affiliation":["ERA/ICD - UMR CNRS 6281, University of Technology of Troyes, TROYES CEDEX, France"],"firstName":"Moez","lastName":"Esseghir","id":"38362919600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1465-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1464-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1466-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8171359","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2105},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient green solution for a balanced energy consumption and delay in the IoT-Fog-Cloud computing","abstract":"This paper introduces a study of the fog computing suitability assessment as a solution for the increasing demand of the IoT devices.

Towards these security and privacy challenges, we combine hierarchical identity based cryptographic mechanisms with emerging blockchain infrastructures and propose a blockchain-based data usage auditing architecture ensuring availability and accountability in a privacy-preserving fashion. Our approach relies on the use of auditable contracts deployed in blockchain infrastructures. Thus, it offers transparent and controlled data access, sharing and processing, so that unauthorized users or untrusted servers cannot process data without client's authorization. Moreover, based on cryptographic mechanisms, our solution preserves privacy of data owners and ensures secrecy for shared data with multiple service providers.

Packet scheduler in LTE network is responsible for assigning resources to attached UEs. Also, femtocell network is considered as promising solution for poor channel in indoor environment. Femtocell deployment within macrocell (traditional base station) would increase the capacity of the cell. Therefore, incubating robust Packet Scheduler scheme within femtocell would deliver better capacity. In this work Packet Scheduler scheme is proposed. It performs with consideration of maximizing the capacity as well as preserving the fairness among UEs. A simulation is conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. The result shows that it outperforms well-known PF scheduler in terms of cell aggregated throughput and average throughput of UEs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125635/8171314/08171396.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA)","doi":"10.1109/NCA.2017.8171396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCA.2017.8171396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8171314","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio resource management in LTE femtocell networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Scheduling algorithms","Measurement","Base stations","Long Term Evolution","Resource management","Femtocell networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","Long Term Evolution","mobility management (mobile radio)","quality of service","resource allocation","telecommunication scheduling","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio resource management","LTE femtocell networks","wireless network system","attached UE","robust packet scheduler scheme","PF scheduler","traditional base station","macrocell","femtocell deployment","indoor environment","allocating resources","PF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","4G","Scheduling","Packet Scheduler","Resource management","Femtocell"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2017-Nov. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Radio resource management in LTE femtocell networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8171396/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417802","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio resource management in LTE femtocell networks","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"72.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083779S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125635","isNumber":"8171314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125635","xplore-issue":"8171314","articleId":"8171396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171565,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Economic dispatch (ED) is one of the key optimization problems in operation of power system. Aim of the ED problem is optimal allocation of power demand to available generators without violating constraints. Fuel cost of generator is non-smooth due to valve point loading and prohibited operating zones. Several conventional and biologically inspired algorithms in the past three decades have been suggested to solve the ED problem. Recently, hybrid algorithms with conventional and biologically inspired algorithms are proposed to solve the ED problem. It has been reported in several articles that quality of solution of the biologically inspired algorithms depends on control parameters. These algorithms take more computational time to get the solution. Research articles from various journals are referred and a short summary is provided. Also, the developments in algorithms and control parameters are provided.","doi":"10.1109/ICRTEECT.2017.18","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Recent Trends in Electrical, Electronics and Computing Technologies (ICRTEECT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Recent Trends in Electrical, Electronics and Computing Technologies (ICRTEECT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170183/8171542/08171575.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRTEECT.2017.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8171542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio Inspired Algorithms in Power System Operation: A Review","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171575","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171575/","displayDocTitle":"Bio Inspired Algorithms in Power System Operation: A Review","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17428054","htmlLink":"/document/8171575/","conferenceDate":"30-31 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio Inspired Algorithms in Power System Operation: A Review","confLoc":"Warangal, India","sourcePdf":"6266a113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098391S","chronDate":"30-31 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170183","isNumber":"8171542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170183","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8171542","articleId":"8171575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171610,"authors":[{"name":"Hana \u0160ahinbegovi\u0107","affiliation":["International Burch University, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"],"firstName":"Hana","lastName":"\u0160ahinbegovi\u0107","id":"37086298740"},{"name":"Laila Mu\u0161i\u0107","affiliation":["International Burch University, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"],"firstName":"Laila","lastName":"Mu\u0161i\u0107","id":"37086298802"},{"name":"Berina Ali\u0107","affiliation":["International Burch University, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"],"firstName":"Berina","lastName":"Ali\u0107","id":"37085865202"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3337-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-3335-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3336-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3338-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8171610","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromyography","Biological neural networks","Training","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Muscles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","electromyography","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UCI Machine Learning Repository database","EMG signal","bispectrum signal analysis","feedforward neural network architecture","artificial neural network","electromyography signals","normal physical actions","musculoskeletal system","diagnose abnormalities","patient behavior","human behavior","developed ANN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["physical action","bispectrum analysis","artificial neural network","expert system","electromyography"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171610","abstract":"Analysis of electromyography (EMG) signals of normal physical actions have found to be important in order to detect certain abnormalities of the musculoskeletal system and diagnose abnormalities in patient behavior.

The most important aspect is the financial status of the company that is implementing the system. How many resources is the company willing to spend is always a difficult dilemma. The second important issue is the actual usefulness of the developed solution. If the system cannot be implemented in the real world, as advanced as it may be in theory, it has very little or no use at all. In this paper, the current state of the picking zone of a medium-to-large logistics company warehouse is analyzed through a real-world case study. On the top of the collected results, a method for the optimal strategic and quantitative item placement in the picking zone is constructed through the usage of fitting algorithms. One month after the method was released to production, a quality check of the system by supervising the warehouse activities of the picking zone is conducted and the results are analyzed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17417689","htmlLink":"/document/8171629/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Application of advanced analysis and predictive algorithm for warehouse picking zone capacity and content prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of advanced analysis and predictive algorithm for warehouse picking zone capacity and content prediction","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"S73.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063983S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125633","isNumber":"8171593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125633","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8171593","articleId":"8171629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171631,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppa Sciortino","affiliation":["Dip. di Matematica e Informatica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppa","lastName":"Sciortino","id":"37076208400"},{"name":"Domenico Tegolo","affiliation":["Dip. di Matematica e Informatica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Tegolo","id":"37355630000"},{"name":"Cesare Valenti","affiliation":["Dip. di Matematica e Informatica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Cesare","lastName":"Valenti","id":"37345120900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3337-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-3335-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3336-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3338-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8171631","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Fetus","Neural networks","Wavelet analysis","Bones","Pregnancy","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","diseases","medical computing","medical disorders","medical image processing","neural nets","obstetrics","thickness measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonsupervised approach","nuchal translucency","wavelet analysis","neural networks","ultrasound imaging","diseases","prenatal age","thickness measure","nuchal transucency","pathologies","correct investigation","mid-sagittal sections","neural network classifiers","mid-sagittal planes","clinical ultrasound images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mid-sagittal section","neural network","nuchal translucency","symmetry transform","wavelet analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171631","abstract":"Ultrasound imaging is a well known noninvasive way to evaluate various diseases during the prenatal age.

A reference implementation of this medium access control (MAC) accelerator using parallel sequence spread spectrum (PSSS) as the physical layer technology is presented and analyzed for scalability and timing.

topology information is essential for an efficient operation of the network. This information is not accurately available, due to uninformed changes that happen from time to time, or uncertain meter readings. Reliable prediction of system status is a highly demanded functionality of smart energy systems, which can enable users or human operators to react quickly to potential future system changes. This paper presents potential of artificial neural networks to determine missing power meter readings in medium voltage (MV) networks where the number of on-line measurements is limited, and state estimation relies heavily on estimates of power injections. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated through simulation using supervisory control and data acquisition and smart meter measurements recorded from an actual MV distribution network. Results are showing that artificial neural networks can have 100% measurements detection accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICAT.2017.8171645","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125633/8171593/08171645.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 XXVI International Conference on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies (ICAT)","publicationTitle":"2017 XXVI International Conference on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies (ICAT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAT.2017.8171645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8171593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of missing power meter readings using artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Detection of missing power meter readings using artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17417678","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171645/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of missing power meter readings using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"S103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074468S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125633","isNumber":"8171593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125633","xplore-issue":"8171593","articleId":"8171645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8171647,"authors":[{"name":"\u0160ejla D\u017eakmic","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering, International University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"],"firstName":"\u0160ejla","lastName":"D\u017eakmic","id":"37086298423"},{"name":"Tarik Namas","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering, International University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"],"firstName":"Tarik","lastName":"Namas","id":"37659144500"},{"name":"Izudin D\u017eafi\u0107","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering, International University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"],"firstName":"Izudin","lastName":"D\u017eafi\u0107","id":"37271727900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3337-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-3335-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3336-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3338-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8171647","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"abstract":"The continuity of service in power systems has a vital economical and social impact on all shareholders; generation, transmission and distribution, and end users. Fault classification within transmission and distribution networks plays an important role in power restoration for guaranteed service continuity. With advances in digital signal processing in terms of speed and algorithms, the use of wavelets transform is made easy and feasible for real-time applications in power systems. In this paper we present two methods of fault classification using Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT). The coefficients of the wavelet decomposition of fault signals are correlated with the coefficients of signals in normal working conditions to deduce fault information. Haar wavelets and multi-resolution analysis are used for detecting the faulty phase while Daubechies wavelet is used to determine if the fault to ground or not. Both suggested methods succeeded in all types of faults simulated using Simulink.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 XXVI International Conference on Information, Communication and Automation

Motion sensor technologies and automatic fall detection systems have emerged as a reliable low-cost solution to this challenge. We develop a hidden Markov model (HMM) based fall detection system to detect falls automatically using a single motion sensor for real-life home monitoring scenarios. We propose a new representation for acceleration signals in HMMs to avoid feature engineering and developed a sensor orientation calibration algorithm to resolve sensor misplacement issues (misplaced sensor location and misaligned sensor orientation) in real-world scenarios. HMM classifiers are trained to detect falls based on acceleration signal data collected from motion sensors. We collect a dataset from experiments of simulated falls and normal activities and acquired a dataset from a real-world fall repository (FARSEEING) to evaluate our system. Our system achieves positive predictive value of 0.981 and sensitivity of 0.992 on the experiment dataset with 200 fall events and 385 normal activities, and positive predictive value of 0.786 and sensitivity of 1.000 on the real-world fall dataset with 22 fall events and 2618 normal activities. Our system's results significantly outperform benchmark systems, which shows the advantage of our HMM-based fall detection system with sensor orientation calibration.

As vehicles typically afford limited processing resources, proposed solutions are rule-based or lightweight machine learning techniques. We argue that this limitation can be lifted with computational offloading commonly used for resource-constrained mobile devices. The increased processing resources available in this manner allow access to more advanced techniques. Using as case study a small four-wheel robotic land vehicle, we demonstrate the practicality and benefits of offloading the continuous task of intrusion detection that is based on deep learning. This approach achieves high accuracy much more consistently than with standard machine learning techniques and is not limited to a single type of attack or the in-vehicle CAN bus as previous work. As input, it uses data captured in real-time that relate to both cyber and physical processes, which it feeds as time series data to a neural network architecture. We use both a deep multilayer perceptron and recurrent neural network architecture, with the latter benefitting from a long-short term memory hidden layer, which proves very useful for learning the temporal context of different attacks. We employ denial of service, command injection and malware as examples of cyber attacks that are meaningful for a robotic vehicle. The practicality of computation offloading depends on the resources afforded onboard and remotely, and the reliability of the communication means between them. Using detection latency as the criterion, we have developed a mathematical model to determine when computation offloading is beneficial given parameters related to the operation of the network and the processing demands of the deep learning model. The more reliable the network and the greater the processing demands, the greater the reduction in detection latency achieved through offloading.","topic":"Security Analytics and Intelligence for Cyber Physical Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171725/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2018","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17612569","htmlLink":"/document/8171725/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cloud-Based Cyber-Physical Intrusion Detection for Vehicles Using Deep Learning","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Cloud-Based Cyber-Physical Intrusion Detection for Vehicles Using Deep Learning","sourcePdf":"access-heartfield-2782159-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114106S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Security Analytics and Intelligence for Cyber Physical Systems"],"articleId":"8171725","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8171728,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Yang Li","affiliation":["School of Energy Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8171728/li-2781705-small.gif","p":["Ming-Yang Li was born in Sichuan, China, in 1991.

Each receiver can be seen as an internal eavesdropper intended by other receivers. Our objective is to achieve the robust beamforming design under imperfect channel state information, in which the total transmission power is minimized with constraints on the achievable secrecy rate and the energy harvesting. Since the problem is nonconvex, we propose a two-level optimization scheme. For the inner problem, we investigate two conservative relaxation approaches, large-deviation inequality and Bernstein-type inequality (BTI), to reformulate the outage secrecy rate constraints into some convex ones, yielding a convex optimization by semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. For the outer problem, it is a K-variable optimization problem, which can be solved via the novel line-dimensional-like search method. Moreover, we characterize the rank profile of SDP relaxed solution for these two approaches. Specifically, the optimal solution is proved to be rank-one. Numerical results are provided to verify the performance of the proposed algorithms, where the LDI-based scheme outperforms the BTI-based scheme in terms of energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2781717","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08171731.pdf","startPage":"2097","endPage":"2109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2781717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficiency Maximization for Secure Multiuser MIMO SWIPT Systems With CSI Uncertainty","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171731","topic":"Recent Advances on Radio Access and Security Methods in 5G Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171731/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficiency Maximization for Secure Multiuser MIMO SWIPT Systems With CSI Uncertainty","volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17542713","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8171731/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91638205, 61771286, 61701457 and 61621091"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy-Efficiency Maximization for Secure Multiuser MIMO SWIPT Systems With CSI Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"access-feng-2781717-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115173S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Recent Advances on Radio Access and Security Methods in 5G Networks"],"articleId":"8171731","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8171732,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Fumarola","affiliation":["IBM Research\u2013Almaden, San Jose, CA, USA","Max Planck Institute for Microstructure Physics, Halle, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245494/8232486/8171732/fumar-2782184-small.gif","p":["Alessandro Fumarola received the M.S. degree in nanotechnology jointly from the Polytechnic of Turin, Italy, INP Grenoble, France, and EPFL Lausanne, Switzerland.

Deterministic and stochastic imperfections in the conductance response of real NVM devices can be encapsulated for modeling within a pair of \u201cjump-tables.\u201d Such jump-tables describe the full cumulative distribution function of conductance-change at each device conductance value, for both weight potentiation (SET) and depression (RESET). First, using several types of artificially constructed jump-tables, we revisit the relative importance of deviations from an ideal NVM with perfectly linear conductance response. Then, using jump-tables measured on improved non-filamentary resistive RAM devices based on Pr\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0.7</sub>\nCa\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0.3</sub>\nMnO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n[see companion paper], we simulate the effects of their nonlinear conductance response on the training of a three-layer fully connected neural network.

Highest accuracies are achieved by programming both conductances on each timestep (\u201cfully bidirectional\u201d), with the improved conductance on/off ratio of Al/Mo/PCMO resulting in marked improvements in training and test accuracy. Further accuracy improvements can be obtained by tuning the relative learning rate for potentiation (SET) by a factor of 1.66\u00d7 with respect to depression (RESET), to offset the slight asymmetry between the average size of the associated SET and RESET conductance changes. Finally, we show that the bidirectional programming of Al/Mo/PCMO can be used to implement high-density neuromorphic systems with a single conductance per synapse, at only a slight degradation to accuracy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programming","Nonvolatile memory","Neuromorphics","Neural networks","Neurons","Electron devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium","backpropagation","calcium compounds","gradient methods","manganese compounds","molybdenum","neural chips","praseodymium compounds","resistive RAM","statistical distributions","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificially constructed jump-tables","ideal NVM","perfectly linear conductance response","improved nonfilamentary resistive RAM devices","nonlinear conductance response","neural network training accuracy","relative learning rate","SET","depression","RESET conductance changes","bidirectional programming","high-density neuromorphic systems","analog neuromorphic synapse","neuromorphic computing","device history","analog nonvolatile memory devices","gradient-descent learning algorithm","NVM devices","cumulative distribution function","device conductance value","weight potentiation","conductance state","device characteristics","three-layer fully connected neural network training","deterministic imperfections","stochastic imperfections","backpropagation","bidirectional nonfilamentary RRAM","Al-Mo-Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-layer neural network","neural network hardware","nonvolatile memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171732","doi":"10.1109/JEDS.2017.2782184","startPage":"169","endPage":"178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of the Electron Devices Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of the Electron Devices Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245494/8232486/08171732.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JEDS.2017.2782184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171732/","displayDocTitle":"Bidirectional Non-Filamentary RRAM as an Analog Neuromorphic Synapse, Part II: Impact of Al/Mo/Pr<sub>0.7</sub>Ca<sub>0.3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> Device Characteristics on Neural Network Training Accuracy","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17502571","htmlLink":"/document/8171732/","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Bidirectional Non-Filamentary RRAM as an Analog Neuromorphic Synapse, Part II: Impact of Al/Mo/Pr<sub>0.7</sub>Ca<sub>0.3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> Device Characteristics on Neural Network Training Accuracy","sourcePdf":"jeds-burr-2782184-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07667S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6245494","isNumber":"8232486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245494","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8232486","articleId":"8171732","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8171733,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8171733/wwang-2780250-small.gif","p":["Wei Wang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from PLA Information Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.

An IDS learns normal and anomalous behavior by analyzing network traffic and can detect unknown and new attacks. However, the performance of an IDS is highly dependent on feature design, and designing a feature set that can accurately characterize network traffic is still an ongoing research issue. Anomaly-based IDSs also have the problem of a high false alarm rate (FAR), which seriously restricts their practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel IDS called the hierarchical spatial-temporal features-based intrusion detection system (HAST-IDS), which first learns the low-level spatial features of network traffic using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and then learns high-level temporal features using long short-term memory networks. The entire process of feature learning is completed by the deep neural networks automatically; no feature engineering techniques are required. The automatically learned traffic features effectively reduce the FAR. The standard DARPA1998 and ISCX2012 data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The experimental results show that the HAST-IDS outperforms other published approaches in terms of accuracy, detection rate, and FAR, which successfully demonstrates its effectiveness in both feature learning and FAR reduction.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08171733.pdf","startPage":"1792","endPage":"1806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HAST-IDS: Learning Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Features Using Deep Neural Networks to Improve Intrusion Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"HAST-IDS: Learning Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Features Using Deep Neural Networks to Improve Intrusion Detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171733/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17573788","htmlLink":"/document/8171733/","volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Pioneer Program of Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"Y654101601"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"HAST-IDS: Learning Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Features Using Deep Neural Networks to Improve Intrusion Detection","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2780250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113458S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8171733","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8171739,"authors":[{"name":"Ian D.

Thin dispersive sheets are often modeled using surface-impedance models in finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) codes in order to deal efficiently with the multiscale nature of the overall structure. Such boundary conditions must be applied to collocated tangential electric and magnetic fields on either side of the surface; this is usually done on the edges of the FDTD mesh cells at the electric field sampling points. However, these edge-based schemes are difficult to implement accurately on stair-cased surfaces. Here, we present a novel face-centered approach to the collocation of the fields for the application of the boundary condition. This approach naturally deals with the ambiguities in the surface normal that arise at the edges on stair-cased surfaces, allowing a simpler implementation. The accuracy of the new scheme is compared to edge-based and conformal approaches using both planar sheet and spherical shell canonical test cases. Staircasing effects are quantified and the new face-centered scheme is shown have up to 3-dB lower error than the edge-based approach in the cases considered, without the complexity and computational cost of conformal techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2017.2778059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave

Surface p-i-n diodes are used to close or open slots in order to achieve required configuration of an aperture. The RSC with a modified WR28 waveguide composes a reconfigurable radiating structure (RRS), which provides three beams directed toward 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, and 45\u00b0. Beam switching is achieved by reconfigurable arrangement of a set of slots. Complementary RRSs connected to the electromechanical RF switch is used to generate remaining -30\u00b0 and -45\u00b0 beams. The gain of each generated beam is similar because different numbers of slots are opened, i.e., three, five, and nine slots for beams directed toward 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, and 45\u00b0, respectively. Aperture of the antenna is controlled by a unit composed of high-current operational amplifiers. Measured results validate the performance of designed millimeter-wave reconfigurable antenna.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/8278903/08171744.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"228","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2017.2781262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2017.2781262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8278903","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8171744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"28 GHz Switched-Beam Antenna Based on S-PIN Diodes for 5G Mobile Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Antenna measurements","Slot antennas","Antenna arrays","Array signal processing","Semiconductor diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","antenna radiation patterns","metamaterial antennas","millimetre wave antenna arrays","p-i-n diodes","rectangular waveguides","slot antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromechanical RF switch","frequency 28.0 GHz","modified WR28 waveguide","radiating reconfigurable structures","millimeter-wave reconfigurable antenna","high-current operational amplifiers","Surface p-i-n diodes","switched beam antenna","reconfigurable semiconductor circuit","rectangular waveguide","five-beam antenna system","5G mobile communications","S-PIN diodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive arrays","antenna arrays","beam switching","millimeter-wave technology","slot antennas","surface p-i-n (S-PIN) diodes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"28 GHz Switched-Beam Antenna Based on S-PIN Diodes for 5G Mobile Communications","volume":"17","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8171744/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17559842","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion"},{"fundingName":"Korean government (MSIT)"},{"fundingName":"Development of a semiconductor based smart antenna for future mobile communications","grantNumber":"2015-0-00268"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"28 GHz Switched-Beam Antenna Based on S-PIN Diodes for 5G Mobile Communications","sourcePdf":"lawp-bogdan-2781262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049649S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"8278903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8278903","articleId":"8171744","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8171746,"authors":[{"name":"Shingo Hiruma","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shingo","lastName":"Hiruma","orcid":"0000-0002-9399-5822","id":"37086108941"},{"name":"Yoshitsugu Otomo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshitsugu","lastName":"Otomo","orcid":"0000-0002-2605-7908","id":"37086299784"},{"name":"Hajime Igarashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hajime","lastName":"Igarashi","orcid":"0000-0002-0852-3231","id":"37301694300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"8171746","dbTime":"41 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":779},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wires","Permeability","Eddy currents","Integral equations","Magnetization","Magnetic domains","Finite element analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy currents","finite element analysis","integral equations","magnetic permeability","magnetisation","wires (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy current analysis","integral equation","macroscopic permeability","litz-wire coil","wire twist","complex permeability","stranded conductors","complex magnetization","proximity effect","homogenization-based finite-element analysis","FEM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Homogenization method","integral equation","litz wire","macroscopic permeability","Ollendorff formula"]}],"abstract":"A new method is introduced to evaluate the macroscopic permeability of a litz wire which is composed of stranded conductors.

We propose two schemes, where the signaling design can be carried out either in each individual time slot or across multiple time slots with and without knowledge of CSI. The scheme involves a joint design of user beamforming matrices, relay beamforming matrices, and user postprocessing matrices, so as to meet interference neutralization and rank conditions. We show that the optimal DoF of N2K per user can be reached for N \u2265 1 for an arbitrary number of user pairs when J = 1.

It holds its attractive features in high efficiency and good accuracy as demonstrated in the method of moments algorithm, and further allows itself to be capable of characterization of 3-D nonplanar structures. By setting the reference plane along each feeding line as the perfect electric and magnetic conductors, i.e., PEC and PMC, the entire error box involved in each feeding line and impressed source can be characterized by using these two calibration standards, namely, short- and open-ended circuits.

The primary anatomical targets are facet joints and epidural spaces. For these procedures, accurate visualization of the spine anatomy is of critical importance. Challenges arising from the interactions between the ultrasound beam and spinal structures including tilt caused by specular reflections, off-axis interference, and reverberations often result in weakened and blurred vertebra surfaces. Previously, adaptive beamforming methods have been proposed to improve the resolution and contrast. However, most of these methods are not specialized for improving the contrast of specular targets like bones. In this paper, we propose an accumulated angle factor (AAF)-based beamforming method customized for bone surface enhancement. This approach applies a Hilbert transform on delay compensated channel data across the receive aperture. The accumulated phase change across the receive aperture is then calculated and utilized as the weight in the beamforming output. We compared our method with classical delay and sum (DAS) beamforming method and adaptive beamforming methods such as Wiener, phase coherence factor (PCF), CF, and generalized CF (GCF) beamforming. In 12 $in~vivo$ volunteer data sets, the mean contrast ratio between the vertebrae surface and the surrounding tissue for DAS, Wiener, PCF, CF, GCF, and the proposed AAF methods are 0.49, 0.64, 0.82, 0.77, 0.76, and 0.91, respectively. The contrast is significantly improved in the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171766/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","volume":"65","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"17508717","pubMedId":"29389653","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8171766/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Accumulated Angle Factor-Based Beamforming to Improve the Visualization of Spinal Structures in Ultrasound Images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accumulated Angle Factor-Based Beamforming to Improve the Visualization of Spinal Structures in Ultrasound Images","sourcePdf":"tuffc-zhuang-2781726-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073313S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"8272539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8272539","articleId":"8171766","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8171767,"authors":[{"name":"Juan M.

This paper proposes solutions for an IPT system to operate efficiently when large changes in coupling take place. To achieve high power efficiency independent of coupling, we utilize inherent regulation properties of resonant converters to avoid losing soft switching for any coupling value, and present the optimal load to the IPT link at the maximum energy throughput coupling. A probability-based model is introduced to assess and optimize the IPT system by analyzing coupling as a distribution in time, which depends on the dynamic behavior of the wireless charging system. The proposed circuits are a Class D rectifier with a resistance compression network in the receiving end and a load-independent Class EF inverter in the transmitting end. Experiments were performed at 6.78 and 13.56 MHz verifying high efficiency for dynamic coupling and variable load resistance. End-to-end efficiencies of up to 88% are achieved at a coil separation larger than one coil radius for a system capable of supplying 150 W to the load, and the energy efficiency was measured at 80% when performing a uniformly distributed linear misalignment of 0-12.5 cm, corresponding to a receiver moving at a constant velocity over a transmitter without power throughput control.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2768244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8400452","startPage":"7744","endPage":"7758","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8400452/08171767.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-MHz IPT Systems for Variable Coupling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8171767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8171767/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-MHz IPT Systems for Variable Coupling","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"17877345","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"9","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of Imperial College London"},{"fundingName":"PINN Programme by the Ministry of Science and ICT of Costa Rica MICITT"},{"fundingName":"University of Costa Rica"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC/EDF Case","grantNumber":"1401488"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC Underpinning Power Electronics 2012: Components Theme","grantNumber":"EP/K034804/1"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC Underpinning Power Electronics 2012: Converters Theme","grantNumber":"EP/K035096/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multi-MHz IPT Systems for Variable Coupling","sourcePdf":"tpel-arteaga-2768244-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121629S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8400452","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8400452","articleId":"8171767","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8171782,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuki Koketsu","affiliation":["Earthquake Research Institute, University of Tokyo, Yayoi 1-1-1, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuki","lastName":"Koketsu"},{"name":"Shutaro Sekine","affiliation":["Earthquake Research Institute, University of Tokyo, Yayoi 1-1-1, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113, Japan"],"firstName":"Shutaro","lastName":"Sekine"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0956-540X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1365-246X"}],"articleNumber":"8171782","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["discontinuities","earth models","ray tracing"]}],"abstract":"We present a \u2018pseudo-bending\u2019 approach to 3-D ray tracing in a spherical earth with discontinuities.

Based on the statistics of classic energy detection scheme, we consider three Bayesian SS estimators, the Weighted Bayesian (WB) estimator, the Gaussian Mixture (GM) estimator and a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier.

Therefore, based on software defined network (SDN), this paper proposes Deep-Learning-based Content Popularity Prediction (DLCPP) to achieve the popularity prediction. DLCPP adopts the switch's computing resources and links in the SDN to build a distributed and reconfigurable deep learning network. For DLCPP, we initially determine the metrics that can reflect changes in content popularity. Second, each network node collects the spatial-temporal joint distribution data of these metrics. Then, the data are used as input to stacked auto-encoders (SAE) in DLCPP to extract the spatiotemporal features of popularity. Finally, we transform the popularity prediction into a multi-classification problem through discretizing the content popularity into multiple classifications. The Softmax classifier is used to achieve the content popularity prediction. Some challenges for DLCPP are also addressed, such as determining the structure of SAE, realizing the neuron function on an SDN switch, and deploying DLCPP on an OpenFlow-based SDN. At the same time, we propose a lightweight caching scheme that integrates cache placement and cache replacement-caching based on popularity prediction and cache capacity (CPC). Abundant experiments demonstrate good performance of DLCPP, and it achieves close to 2.1%~15% and 5.2%~40% accuracy improvements over neural networks and auto regressive, respectively. Benefitting from DLCPP's better prediction accuracy, CPC can yield a steady improvement of caching performance over other dominant cache management frameworks.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2781716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2781716","startPage":"5075","endPage":"5089","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08172025.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Content Popularity Prediction and Caching for ICN: A Deep Learning Approach With SDN","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8172025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Content Popularity Prediction and Caching for ICN: A Deep Learning Approach With SDN","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2018","accessionNumber":"17612571","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8172025/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571141 and 51575116"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014A030310349, 2014A030313637 and 2014A030313524"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong provincial key platform and major scientific research projects","grantNumber":"2015KTSCX107"},{"fundingName":"China National Spark Program","grantNumber":"2015GA780065"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007162","fundingName":"Science and Technology Project of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2017A010102014 and 2016A010102022"},{"fundingName":"Guangzhou Education Science 12th Five-Year planning","grantNumber":"1201532878"},{"fundingName":"Innovative Academic Team Project of Guangzhou Education System","grantNumber":"1201610013"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Project for Universities in Guangzhou (Researching on key technology of achieving multisource transmission for ICN, China","grantNumber":"1201420845"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Content Popularity Prediction and Caching for ICN: A Deep Learning Approach With SDN","sourcePdf":"access-liu-2781716-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142046S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8172025","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8172033,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Ricci","affiliation":["Information Engineering Department, University of Florence, Florence, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/8272539/8172033/ricci-2781715-small.gif","p":["Stefano Ricci (M\u201907\u2013SM\u201916) received the master\u2019s degree in electronics engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronic systems engineering from the University of Florence, Florence, Italy, in 1997 and 2001, respectively.","Since 2006, he has been an Assistant Professor with the Information Engineering Department, University of Florence.

On the other hand, vector Doppler methods produce angle-independent estimates by, e.g., combining the frequency shifts measured from different directions. Moreover, thanks to the transmission of plane waves, the investigation of a 2-D region is possible with high temporal resolution, but, unfortunately, the clinical use of these methods is hampered by the massive calculation power required for their real-time execution. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on the transmission of plane waves and the simultaneous reception of echoes from 16 distinct subapertures of a linear array probe, which produces eight lines distributed over a 2-D region. The method was implemented on the ULAO-OP 256 research scanner and tested both in phantom and in vivo. A continuous real-time refresh rate of 36 Hz was achieved in duplex combination with a standard B-mode at pulse repetition frequency of 8 kHz. Accuracies of -11% on velocity and of 2\u00b0on angle measurements have been obtained in phantom experiments. Accompanying movies show how the method improves the quantitative measurements of blood velocities and details the flow configurations in the carotid artery of a volunteer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Blood Velocity Vector Measurement Over a 2-D Region","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2781715","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/8272539/08172033.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2781715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8272539","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8172033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8172033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Blood Velocity Vector Measurement Over a 2-D Region","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8172033/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17508720","pubMedId":"29389652","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Blood Velocity Vector Measurement Over a 2-D Region","sourcePdf":"tuffc-ricci-2781715-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067182S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"8272539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8272539","articleId":"8172033","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8172037,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Dong","affiliation":["TSMC, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8325040/8172037/dong-2776309-small.gif","p":["Qing Dong (S\u201914) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in microelectronis from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2010 and 2013, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, in 2017.","He is currently with TSMC, San Jose, CA, USA.

The proposed SRAM cell uses the n-well as the write wordline to perform write operations and eliminate the write access transistors, achieving 15% area saving compared with conventional 8T SRAM. The decoupled differential read paths significantly improve read noise margin, and therefore reliable multi-word activation can be enabled to perform in-memory Boolean logic functions. Reconfigurable differential sense amplifiers are employed to realize fast normal read or multi-functional logic operations. Moreover, the proposed 4 + 2T SRAM can be reconfigured as binary content-addressable memory (BCAM) or ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) for searching operations, achieving 0.13 fJ/search/bit at 0.35 V. The chip is fabricated in 55-nm deeply depleted channel technology. The area efficiency is 65% for a 128 \u00d7 128 pushed-rule array including all peripherals such as column-wise sense amplifier for read/logic and row-wise sense amplifier for BCAM/TCAM operations.

The dipole is fabricated using vias in a standard PCB process to fit at the phone or tablet edges featuring wideband operation with broad half-power beamwidth in the elevation plane (HPBWELEV), high gain and high front-to-back radiation ratio (F/B). For enhanced gain, parasitic-vias are added in front of the dipole as directors. To improve HPBW without sacrificing gain, the directors are implemented as V-shaped bisection parasitic-vias. A via-fence surrounds the dipole structure to suppress back radiation and enhance F/B. The dipole is connected to a parallel-strip line (PS) which is interfaced to the main SIW feed through a novel SIW-to-PS transition. Thorough investigation, optimization, and parametric study are provided for each design parameter of the proposed structure.

In each case, we express our results in terms of polarization tensors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8172111/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","volume":"80","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"June 2015","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The perturbation of electromagnetic fields at distances that are large compared with the object's size","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"The perturbation of electromagnetic fields at distances that are large compared with the object's size","sourcePdf":"hxu009.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032024S","chronDate":"June  2015","isNumber":"8172105","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016796","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8172111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8172278,"authors":[{"name":"Meg Tonkin","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology at the Centre For Artificial Intelligence-Innovation and Enterprise Research Lab (The Magic Lab), University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Meg","lastName":"Tonkin","id":"37086286963"},{"name":"Jonathan Vitale","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology at the Centre For Artificial Intelligence-Innovation and Enterprise Research Lab (The Magic Lab), University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Vitale","id":"37085449278"},{"name":"Suman Ojha","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology at the Centre For Artificial Intelligence-Innovation and Enterprise Research Lab (The Magic Lab), University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Suman","lastName":"Ojha","id":"37086288124"},{"name":"Mary-Anne Williams","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology at the Centre For Artificial Intelligence-Innovation and Enterprise Research Lab (The Magic Lab), University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Mary-Anne","lastName":"Williams","id":"37588020400"},{"name":"Paul Fuller","affiliation":["Stockland, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Fuller","id":"37086285161"},{"name":"William Judge","affiliation":["Commonwealth Bank Innovation Lab, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Judge","id":"37086291397"},{"name":"Xun Wang","affiliation":["Commonwealth Bank Innovation Lab, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085436875"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3518-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3517-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3519-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9437"}],"articleNumber":"8172278","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Human-robot interaction","Australia","Electronic mail","Speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-robot interaction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public spaces","shopping centre","robot application","robot engagement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8172278","abstract":"Nowadays, robots are gradually appearing in public spaces such as libraries, train stations, airports and shopping centres. Only a limited percentage of research literature explores robot applications in public spaces. Studying robot applications in the wild is particularly important for designing commercially viable applications able to meet a specific goal. Therefore, in this paper we conduct an experiment to test a robot application in a shopping centre, aiming to provide results relevant for today's technological capability and market. We compared the performance of a robot and a human in promoting food samples in a shopping centre, a well known commercial application, and then analysed the effects of the type of engagement used to achieve this goal. Our results show that the robot is able to engage customers similarly to a human as expected. However unexpectedly, while an actively engaging human was able to perform better than a passively engaging human, we found the opposite effect for the robot. In this paper we investigate this phenomenon, with possible explanation ready to be explored and tested in subsequent research.","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2017.8172278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2017.8172278","startPage":"42","endPage":"49","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8116593/8172268/08172278.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 26th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8172268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Would you like to sample?

This also hugely affects their participation in the activities of daily living. Improving postural control functions in people with lower-limb amputation has the aim to enhance their quality of life and is achieved through the restoration of their lost sensory feedback. The objective of this paper is to propose a stimulation system for restoring plantar pressure perception and knee-joint proprioception in lower-limb amputees. The proposed approach is based on the combined use of two FSRs, two accelerometers and two or three vibrotactile actuators. For validating the system, two experimental sessions were carried out on sixteen healthy subjects and one lower-limb amputee. They were aimed to (i) assess if vibrotactile feedback can improve balance control in lower-limb amputees and (ii) investigate the potentiality of the vibrotactile perception as a means to restore amputees' knee-joint proprioception. Quantitative indices capable of describing users' performance were extracted from the processed data and a statistical analysis was performed to compare different types of sensory feedback: i.e. (i) augmented visuo-proprioceptive feedback, no feedback, forearm vibrotactile feedback and low-back vibrotactile feedback in the 1\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">st</sup>\n experimental session and (ii) forearm continuous vibrotactile feedback, low-back continuous vibrotactile feedback, forearm discrete vibrotactile feedback, and low-back discrete vibrotactile feedback in the 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">nd</sup>\n experimental session.

Since the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can learn temporal dependencies from instances with a periodic pattern, we propose two deep learning architectures based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The first (MT-LSTM) combines three LSTMs deployed to learn different time-scale dependencies from pre-processed skeleton data. The second (CNN-LSTM) exploits the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically extract features by the correlation of the limbs in a skeleton 3D-grid representation.

Physical cooperation among humans is mainly based on the sense of touch and usually starts with hand contacts. If a robot can distinguish a human touch from a generic contact, the human-robot cooperation can be more natural and effective. The proposed approach consists in transforming the sensor pressure measurements distributed on the robot surface into a convenient 2D representation of the contact shape, i.e., a contact image. The image-based representation of contacts allows facing the problem of human touch classification by applying machine learning methods already developed for image classification. The experiments have been performed using a robotic skin, composed of 768 tactile elements, placed on a Baxter robot forearm. The contact classification has been performed using a Convolutional Neural Network obtaining an accuracy higher than 97% experimentally validating the proposed approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

The user is assisted by visual indicators and demo videos. EMG patterns recognition is done with EMG features and a multi-layer Artificial neural network (ANN), the ANN classifier output is used to synchronize the demo video with the detected movement, the transition between states is done automatically when the current state's movement is correct and the required number of repetition is reached. The ANN learning is done using back-propagation algorithm, we have used only two sEMG electrodes and four common used timedomain EMG feature extraction methods, the features quality is evaluated by the average Rand index using eight unsupervised clustering algorithms.

We present diurnal detection rates and radiant density plots from 18 separate observational campaigns, each lasting for at least one diurnal cycle. Our data comprise more than 106 000 meteors. All six recognized apparent sporadic meteor sources are discernable and their average orbital distributions are presented in terms of geocentric velocity, semimajor axis, inclination and eccentricity. The north and south apex have radiant densities an order of magnitude higher than other apparent source regions. The diurnal detection rates show clear seasonal dependence. The main cause of the seasonal variation is the tilt of the Earth's axis, causing the elevation of the Earth's apex above the local horizon to change as the Earth revolves around the Sun. Yet, the meteor rate variation is not symmetric with respect to the equinoxes. When comparing the radiant density at different times of the year, and thus at different solar longitudes along the Earth's orbit, we have found that the north and south apex source regions fluctuate in strength.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.21407.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8176330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.21407.x","publicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","displayPublicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016813/8176330/08176341.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The 2009\u20132010 MU radar head echo observation programme for sporadic and shower meteors: radiant densities and diurnal rates","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"OUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2012","displayDocTitle":"The 2009\u20132010 MU radar head echo observation programme for sporadic and shower meteors: radiant densities and diurnal rates","volume":"425","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8176341/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"The 2009\u20132010 MU radar head echo observation programme for sporadic and shower meteors: radiant densities and diurnal rates","sourcePdf":"4251135.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064459S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","isNumber":"8176330","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016813","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8176341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8179017,"authors":[{"name":"Silvia Bonettini","firstName":"Silvia","lastName":"Bonettini"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-4979"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1464-3642"}],"articleNumber":"8179017","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["constrained optimization","alternating algorithms","gradient projection methods","non-negative matrix factorization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8179017","doi":"10.1093/imanum/drq024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/imanum/drq024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8179007","publicationTitle":"IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016799/8179007/08179017.pdf","startPage":"1431","endPage":"1452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inexact block coordinate descent methods with application to non-negative matrix factorization","abstract":"This paper is concerned with the cyclic block coordinate descent method, also known as the nonlinear Gauss\u2013Seidel (GS) method, where the solution of an optimization problem is achieved by partitioning the variables in blocks and successively minimizing with respect to each block. The properties of the objective function that guarantee the convergence of such alternating scheme have been widely investigated in the literature and it is well known that without suitable convexity hypotheses, the method may fail to locate the stationary points when more than two blocks of variables are employed. In this paper the general constrained nonconvex case is considered, presenting three contributions. First, a general method allowing an approximate solution of each block minimization subproblem is devised and the related convergence analysis is developed, showing that the proposed inexact method has the same convergence properties as the standard nonlinear GS method. Then a cyclic block gradient projection method is analysed, proving that it leads to stationary points for every number of blocks. Finally, the cyclic block gradient method is applied to large-scale problems arising from the non-negative matrix factorization approach. The results of a numerical experimentation on image recognition problems are also reported.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8179017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","volume":"31","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Inexact block coordinate descent methods with application to non-negative matrix factorization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inexact block coordinate descent methods with application to non-negative matrix factorization","sourcePdf":"drq024.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024843S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","isNumber":"8179007","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016799","citationCount":"11","articleId":"8179017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8179257,"authors":[{"name":"Maxim A.

Results of numerical experiments are presented, which illustrate the performance of the stabilized method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stabilized finite element method for advection\u2013diffusion equations on surfaces","publicationTitle":"IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis","doi":"10.1093/imanum/drt016","displayPublicationTitle":"IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016799/8179249/08179257.pdf","startPage":"732","endPage":"758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/imanum/drt016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8179249","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8179257","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8179257/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"A stabilized finite element method for advection\u2013diffusion equations on surfaces","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"April 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stabilized finite element method for advection\u2013diffusion equations on surfaces","sourcePdf":"drt016.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02821S","chronDate":"April  2014","isNumber":"8179249","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016799","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8179257","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":8179302,"authors":[{"name":"Yueying Wang","firstName":"Yueying","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Quanbao Wang","firstName":"Quanbao","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Dengping Duan","firstName":"Dengping","lastName":"Duan"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0265-0754"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1471-6887"}],"articleNumber":"8179302","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H\u221e filtering","sampled-data","missing measurements","singularly perturbed systems"]}],"abstract":"This brief is concerned with \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$H\\infty$</tex>\n filtering problem for singularly perturbed systems (SPSs) with variable sampling and probabilistic missing measurements.

The recent deployment of large-scale dense arrays providing high-quality data, in combination with efficient seismic data processing techniques, may provide important and accurate observations over large portions of the globe poorly sampled until now. Major challenges are low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and interference with unwanted neighbouring phases. We address these problems by introducing scale-dependent slowness filters that preserve time-space resolution. We combine complex wavelet and slant-stack transforms to obtain the slant-stacklet transform. This is a redundant high-resolution directional wavelet transform with a direction (here slowness) resolution that can be adapted to the signal requirements. To illustrate this approach, we use this expansion to design coherence-driven filters that allow us to obtain clean PcP observations (a weak phase often hidden in the coda of the P wave), for events with magnitude Mw\ue251>\ue2515.4 and distances up to 80\u00b0. In this context, we then minimize a linear misfit between P and PcP waveforms to improve the quality of PcP\u2013P traveltime measurements as compared to a standard cross-correlation method. This significantly increases both the quantity and the quality of PcP\u2013P differential traveltime measurements available for the modelling of structure near the core\u2013mantle boundary. The accuracy of our measurements is limited mainly by the highest frequencies of the signals used and the level of noise. We apply this methodology to two examples of high-quality data from dense arrays located in north America. While focusing here on body-wave separation, the tools we propose are more general and may contribute to enhancing seismic signal observations in global seismology in situations of low SNR and high signal interference.","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time-series analysis","Wavelet transform","Spatial analysis","Mantle processes","Body waves"]}],"doi":"10.1093/gji/ggv010","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8179611/08179620.pdf","startPage":"207","endPage":"223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8179611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggv010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extraction of weak PcP phases using the slant-stacklet transform \u2014 I: method and examples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8179620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","displayDocTitle":"Extraction of weak PcP phases using the slant-stacklet transform \u2014 I: method and examples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8179620/","volume":"201","issue":"1","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2015","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Extraction of weak PcP phases using the slant-stacklet transform \u2014 I: method and examples","sourcePdf":"ggv010.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02098S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","isNumber":"8179611","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8179620","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8179649,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Maran\u00f2","firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Maran\u00f2"},{"name":"Donat F\u00e4h","firstName":"Donat","lastName":"F\u00e4h"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0956-540X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1365-246X"}],"articleNumber":"8179649","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time-series analysis","Probability distributions","Surface waves and free oscillations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8179649","doi":"10.1093/gji/ggt187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggt187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8179647","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8179647/08179649.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Processing of translational and rotational motions of surface waves: performance analysis and applications to single sensor and to array measurements","abstract":"The analysis of rotational seismic motions has received considerable attention in the last years. Recent advances in sensor technologies allow us to measure directly the rotational components of the seismic wavefield. Today this is achieved with improved accuracy and at an affordable cost. The analysis and the study of rotational motions are, to a certain extent, less developed than other aspects of seismology due to the historical lack of instrumental observations. This is due to both the technical challenges involved in measuring rotational motions and to the widespread belief that rotational motions are insignificant. This paper addresses the joint processing of translational and rotational motions from both the theoretical and the practical perspectives. Our attention focuses on the analysis of motions of both Rayleigh waves and Love waves from recordings of single sensors and from an array of sensors. From the theoretical standpoint, analysis of Fisher information (FI) allows us to understand how the different measurement types contribute to the estimation of quantities of geophysical interest. In addition, we show how rotational measurements resolve ambiguity on parameter estimation in the single sensor setting. We quantify the achievable estimation accuracy by means of Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound (CRB). From the practical standpoint, a method for the joint processing of rotational and translational recordings to perform maximum likelihood (ML) estimation is presented. The proposed technique estimates parameters of Love waves and Rayleigh waves from single sensor or array recordings. We support and illustrate our findings with a comprehensive collection of numerical examples. Applications to real recordings are also shown.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8179649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","volume":"196","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Processing of translational and rotational motions of surface waves: performance analysis and applications to single sensor and to array measurements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Processing of translational and rotational motions of surface waves: performance analysis and applications to single sensor and to array measurements","sourcePdf":"ggt187.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017716S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","isNumber":"8179647","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8179649","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8179653,"authors":[{"name":"Malcolm Sambridge","firstName":"Malcolm","lastName":"Sambridge"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0956-540X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1365-246X"}],"articleNumber":"8179653","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Numerical solutions","Inverse theory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8179653","abstract":"Non-linear inverse problems in the geosciences often involve probabilistic sampling of multimodal density functions or global optimization and sometimes both. Efficient algorithmic tools for carrying out sampling or optimization in challenging cases are of major interest. Here results are presented of some numerical experiments with a technique, known as Parallel Tempering, which originated in the field of computational statistics but is finding increasing numbers of applications in fields ranging from Chemical Physics to Astronomy. To date, experience in use of Parallel Tempering within earth sciences problems is very limited. In this paper, we describe Parallel Tempering and compare it to related methods of Simulated Annealing and Simulated Tempering for optimization and sampling, respectively. A key feature of Parallel Tempering is that it satisfies the detailed balance condition required for convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) algorithms while improving the efficiency of probabilistic sampling. Numerical results are presented on use of Parallel Tempering for trans-dimensional inversion of synthetic seismic receiver functions and also the simultaneous fitting of multiple receiver functions using global optimization. These suggest that its use can significantly accelerate sampling algorithms and improve exploration of parameter space in optimization. Parallel Tempering is a meta-algorithm which may be used together with many existing McMC sampling and direct search optimization techniques. It's generality and demonstrated performance suggests that there is significant potential for applications to both sampling and optimization problems in the geosciences.","doi":"10.1093/gji/ggt342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggt342","startPage":"357","endPage":"374","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8179647/08179653.pdf","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8179647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Parallel Tempering algorithm for probabilistic sampling and multimodal optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Parallel Tempering algorithm for probabilistic sampling and multimodal optimization","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","volume":"196","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8179653/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Parallel Tempering algorithm for probabilistic sampling and multimodal optimization","sourcePdf":"ggt342.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038727S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","isNumber":"8179647","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"6","articleId":"8179653","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8179748,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In this paper, first, we use 23 sets of measurement from subpixel correlation of SAR images and differential interferometry to retrieve the 3-D coseismic surface displacement field. The obtained horizontal and vertical components along the fault trace are then compared, respectively, to equivalent measurements obtained from subpixel correlation of two optical ASTER images and in situ field measurements. Second, the coseismic fault geometry parameters and slip distribution at depth are estimated. In addition to the one segment slip model as reported in previous work, a two segments slip model that better fits the surface fault break is proposed. The improvement of the two segments slip model in interpreting the measured displacement field is highlighted through comparison of residuals of both slip models. Taking advantage of differential interferometry measurements that provide precise and continuous information in the far field of the fault, firstly, a wedge thrust according to Bendick et\ue251al. to the Northwest of the main rupture built on our two segments model is tested. According to the obtained results, the residual of the two segments main rupture plus wedge thrust model is slightly smaller than the residual of the two segments model to the Northwest of the Balakot\u2013Bagh fault. Secondly, we test the sensitivity of our slip model to the presence of slip along a d\u00e9collement as evidenced by Jouanne et\ue251al. through post-seismic analysis.

This method makes use of unstructured tetrahedral meshes locally refined according to the medium properties (h-adaptivity), and of approximation orders that can change from one element to another according to an adequate criterion (p-adaptivity). These two features allow us to significantly reduce the computational cost of the simulations. Moreover, we have designed an efficient CPML absorbing boundary condition, both in terms of absorption and computational cost, by combining approximation orders in the numerical domain. A quadratic interpolation is typically used in the medium to obtain the required accuracy, while lower approximation orders are used in the CPMLs to reduce the total computational cost and to obtain a well-balanced workload over the processors. While the efficiency of DG-FEMs have been largely demonstrated for high approximation orders, we favour the use of low approximation orders as they are more appropriate to the applications we are interested in. In particular, we address the issues of seismic modelling and seismic imaging in cases of complex geological structures that require a fine discretization of the medium. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach within the framework of the EUROSEISTEST verification and validation project, which is designed to compare high-frequency (up to 4 Hz) numerical predictions of ground motion in the Volvi basin (Greece). Through the tetrahedral meshing, we have achieved fine discretization of the basin, which appears to be a sine qua non condition for accurate computation of surface waves diffracted at the basin edges. We compare our results with predictions computed with the spectral element method (SEM), and demonstrate that our method yields the same level of accuracy with computation times of the same order of magnitude.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2010.04764.x","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8179869/08179899.pdf","startPage":"941","endPage":"962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2010.04764.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8179869","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An hp-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin finite-element method for 3-D elastic wave modelling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8179899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8179899/","displayDocTitle":"An hp-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin finite-element method for 3-D elastic wave modelling","volume":"183","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An hp-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin finite-element method for 3-D elastic wave modelling","sourcePdf":"1832941.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017318S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","isNumber":"8179869","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8179899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"}]
