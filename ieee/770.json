In addition, adaptive modulation has been adopted widely in wireless communication to improve spectral efficiency. Use of adaptive modulation for cooperative cognitive relaying transmission to maximize throughput under bit error rate (BER) constraint is an open issue. In this paper, we propose an adaptive subcarrier sharing scheme for OFDM-based cooperative cognitive radio system, wherein cognitive (secondary) system helps the primary system to achieve its target rate of communication in exchange for opportunistic spectrum sharing. Secondary transmitter uses adaptive mode of transmission to relay the primary signal with higher throughput while maintaining the BER constraint of primary system. At primary receiver, a BER-based selection combining scheme is employed to combine the signals received in two phases. Closed-form analytical expressions for BER and outage probability of primary and secondary system for a Rayleigh flat fading channel have been derived. Results show that the outage probability with the proposed scheme (for dissimilar modulation) outperforms direct transmission and conventional maximal ratio combining scheme (for similar modulation).","doi":"10.1109/TCCN.2016.2621750","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687307/7801348/07707306.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2016.2621750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7801348","startPage":"370","endPage":"380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Subcarrier Sharing Scheme for OFDM-Based Cooperative Cognitive Radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Subcarrier Sharing Scheme for OFDM-Based Cooperative Cognitive Radios","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707306/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7707306/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Subcarrier Sharing Scheme for OFDM-Based Cooperative Cognitive Radios","sourcePdf":"tccn-gupta-2621750-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067337S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"7801348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7801348","articleId":"7707306","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7707308,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroshi Fuketa","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Fuketa","orcid":"0000-0003-0171-6679","id":"37408950800"},{"name":"Shinichi O\u2019uchi","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinichi","lastName":"O\u2019uchi","id":"37299257100"},{"name":"Takashi Matsukawa","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Matsukawa","id":"37085346120"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7707308","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":863},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Ultrasonic imaging","Oscillators","Sensitivity","Transistors","Radio frequency","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Things","low-power electronics","radio receivers","radiofrequency oscillators","ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["super-regenerative ultrasound wake-up receiver","power scalability","ultralow-power wake-up receiver","Internet of Things applications","Colpitts-oscillator-based super-regenerative receiver","COSR","power consumption","signal sensitivity","voltage 0.3 V","power 1 muW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Super-regenerative","ultralow power","ultralow voltage","ultrasound","wake-up receiver"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents an ultralow-power wake-up receiver using ultrasound for Internet of Things applications.

Recent works focus on applying machine learning techniques for Twitter spam detection, which make use of the statistical features of tweets. In our labeled tweets data set, however, we observe that the statistical properties of spam tweets vary over time, and thus, the performance of existing machine learning-based classifiers decreases. This issue is referred to as \u201cTwitter Spam Drift\u201d. In order to tackle this problem, we first carry out a deep analysis on the statistical features of one million spam tweets and one million non-spam tweets, and then propose a novel Lfun scheme. The proposed scheme can discover \u201cchanged\u201d spam tweets from unlabeled tweets and incorporate them into classifier's training process. A number of experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed scheme. The results show that our proposed Lfun scheme can significantly improve the spam detection accuracy in real-world scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Features-Based Real-Time Detection of Drifted Twitter Spam","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2016.2621888","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7831515/07707341.pdf","startPage":"914","endPage":"925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2016.2621888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7831515","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707341/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Features-Based Real-Time Detection of Drifted Twitter Spam","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7707341/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16636483","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ARC Linkage Project","grantNumber":"LP120200266"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401371"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Statistical Features-Based Real-Time Detection of Drifted Twitter Spam","sourcePdf":"tifs-xiang-2621888-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103183S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7831515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"7831515","articleId":"7707341","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7707360,"authors":[{"name":"Adel M.

In particular, we design the probabilistic admission control parameter of the PU packets in the secondary user (SU) relaying queue and the randomized service parameter at the SU under non-work-conserving (non-WC) and WC cooperation policies. In the non-WC policy, two constrained optimization problems are formulated; the first problem is maximizing the SU throughput while the second problem is minimizing the SU average delay. In both problems, a constraint is imposed on the maximum allowable average delay of the PU. We show the equivalence of the two problems and develop a low-complexity line search algorithm to find the optimal parameters. Subsequently, the idea of optimizing the SU average delay is developed for the more complex WC policy, for its superior resource utilization and performance. Due to the sheer complexity of this optimization problem, we formulate another problem whose solution yields a suboptimal upper bound on the optimal SU delay. Afterwards, a practical WC-policy-based algorithm is designed in order to closely approach the optimal value of the SU delay. We show, through numerical results, that the proposed cooperation policies represent the best compromise between enhancing the SU QoS and satisfying the PU QoS requirements. Furthermore, the superior performance of the suboptimal WC policy over the non-WC policy is illustrated. Finally, the merits of the WC-policy-based algorithm are demonstrated through extensive simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707360/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","volume":"65","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"16808421","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7707360/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks Performance With Primary QoS Provisioning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation)","grantNumber":"NPRP 4-1034-2-385 and NPRP 5-782-2-322"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks Performance With Primary QoS Provisioning","sourcePdf":"tcomm-elmahdy-2621744-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.240042S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7900485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7900485","articleId":"7707360","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7707361,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Jian Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8244326/7707361/li-2616906-small.gif","p":["Xiao-Jian Li (M\u201916) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2011.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University.

These batteries are recharged regularly either by human intervention or using energy harvesting techniques, such as solar or wind energy. As such, it becomes particularly crucial to conserve battery power until the next recharge cycle in order to maintain network operation and connectivity. This paper examines a vehicular network whose RSU dispossesses a permanent power source but is instead equipped with a large battery, which is periodically recharged. In what follows, a reinforcement learning technique, i.e., protocol for energy-efficient adaptive scheduling using reinforcement learning (PEARL), is proposed for the purpose of optimizing the RSU's downlink traffic scheduling during a discharge period. PEARL's objective is to equip the RSU with the required artificial intelligence to realize and, hence, exploit an optimal scheduling policy that will guarantee the operation of the vehicular network during the discharge cycle while fulfilling the largest number of service requests. The simulation input parameters were chosen in a way that guarantees the convergence of PEARL, whose exploitation showed better results when compared with three heuristic benchmark scheduling algorithms in terms of a vehicle's quality of experience and the RSU's throughput. For instance, the deployment of the well-trained PEARL agent resulted in at least 50% improved performance over the best heuristic algorithm in terms of the percentage of vehicles departing with incomplete service requests.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2622180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2622180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7951139/07707368.pdf","startPage":"4592","endPage":"4601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reinforcement Learning Technique for Optimizing Downlink Scheduling in an Energy-Limited Vehicular Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Reinforcement Learning Technique for Optimizing Downlink Scheduling in an Energy-Limited Vehicular Network","volume":"66","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7707368/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16965041","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707368/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Concordia University and National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reinforcement Learning Technique for Optimizing Downlink Scheduling in an Energy-Limited Vehicular Network","sourcePdf":"tvt-assi-2622180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082447S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7707368","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7707369,"authors":[{"name":"Hadi Khani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western University, London, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/7882730/7707369/khani-2622003-small.gif","p":["Hadi Khani (S\u201909\u2013M\u201916) received the B.Sc. degree\n from Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, in 2006, the M.Sc. degree from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran,\n in 2009, and the M.E.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Western University, London, ON, Canada, in 2014 and 2016,\n respectively, all in electrical engineering.","From 2009 to 2012, he was a Senior Electrical Engineer and Technical Supervisor with Pajoohandeh-Niroo Electrical\n Power Research and Development Company, Isfahan.

By deriving the sum-rate of the SC-FDP massive MIMO system theoretically, we show that this method obtains a sum-rate similar to that of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) massive MIMO. We also derive the theoretical sum-rate of both SC-FDP and OFDM in a non-synchronized massive MIMO scenario and show that the rate of the former is significantly larger than that of the latter. Moreover, we theoretically analyze the sum-rate of both systems in the presence of power amplifier non-linearity. All the sum-rates are derived for both zero forcing and matched filter precoding schemes. The results show that the effect of power amplifier non-linearity on the sum-rate of both systems is similar when the number of users is large. We also compare SC-FDP with OFDM from the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) and complexity viewpoints. Although the PAPR of SC-FDP signals is lower than that of OFDM signals, for MIMO systems, the difference between their PAPR decreases as we increase the number of users. Thus, both techniques can have similar PAPR in massive MIMO systems. The overall complexity of SC-FDP and OFDM is similar. Due to the mentioned facts, SC-FDP can be considered as a promising transmission scheme for the downlink of the massive MIMO systems in the presence of carrier frequency offset and power amplifier non-linearities.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2614304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2614304","startPage":"1164","endPage":"1175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8318336/07707375.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massive MIMO Downlink Based on Single Carrier Frequency Domain Processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO Downlink Based on Single Carrier Frequency Domain Processing","volume":"66","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2018","accessionNumber":"17617351","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7707375/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundac o para a Ci\u0142ncia e Tecnologia (FCT) and Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es o es","grantNumber":"UID/EEA/50008/2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive MIMO Downlink Based on Single Carrier Frequency Domain Processing","sourcePdf":"tcomm-sabbaghian-2614304-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098722S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8318336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8318336","articleId":"7707375","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7707376,"authors":[{"name":"Jingook Kim","affiliation":["School of ECE, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7809129/7707376/kim-2611009-small.gif","p":["Jingook Kim (M\u201909\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejon, in 2000, 2002, and 2006, respectively.

The statistical eye and BER eye diagrams obtained from the proposed method are validated with HSPICE simulations. The effects of the SSO patterns as well as the channel ISI are successfully included in the proposed method. Also, the effects of input rise time and the number of parallel SSO buffers are investigated, and the proposed method is extended for analysis of SSO buffers with the data bus inversion (DBI) coding. The method should be practically useful for design of wideband memory I/O interfaces and low-cost consumer devices by reducing the computational time of the jitter and BER drastically.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2611009","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7809129/07707376.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2611009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Analysis for Pattern-Dependent Simultaneous Switching Outputs (SSO) of Parallel Single-Ended Buffers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707376","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Analysis for Pattern-Dependent Simultaneous Switching Outputs (SSO) of Parallel Single-Ended Buffers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707376/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16618472","htmlLink":"/document/7707376/","volume":"64","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002701","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"2013R1A1A2058045"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Analysis for Pattern-Dependent Simultaneous Switching Outputs (SSO) of Parallel Single-Ended Buffers","sourcePdf":"tcsi-kim-2611009-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070892S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7809129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7809129","articleId":"7707376","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7707378,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Rahiminejad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Rahiminejad","id":"37400061700"},{"name":"Mehdi Saberi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Saberi","orcid":"0000-0002-4222-7532","id":"37409835800"},{"name":"Reza Lotfi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran","Microelectronics Department, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Lotfi","orcid":"0000-0002-8422-1809","id":"37270066800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7707378","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":962},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707378","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Quantization (signal)","Radiation detectors","Clocks","Electrocardiography","Digital circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS digital integrated circuits","comparators (circuits)","low-power electronics","power aware computing","power consumption","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power-efficient signal-specific ADC","sensor-interface applications","signal-specific power-efficient analog-to-digital converter","digital code","low-varying input signals","power consumption","capacitive digital-to-analog converter","comparator","digital circuits","CMOS technology","sampling rate","size 0.18 mum","voltage 1 V","word length 8 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Difference analog-to-digital converter (ADC)","low power","sensor-interface circuits"]}],"abstract":"A novel signal-specific power-efficient analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is proposed for sensor-interface applications.

While conventional coded systems suffer from cliff effect as the channel condition varies dynamically, uncoded linear-transformed transmission (ULT) provides elegant quality degradation for wide channel SNR range. ULT skips non-linear operations, such as quantization and entropy coding. Instead, it utilizes linear decorrelation transform and linear scaling power allocation to achieve optimized transmission. This paper presents a theoretical analysis for power-distortion optimization of ULT. In addition to the observation in our previous work that a decorrelation transform can bring significant performance gain, this paper reveals that exploiting the energy diversity in transformed signal is the key to achieve the full potential of decorrelation transform. In particular, we investigated the efficiency of ULT with exact or inexact signal statistics, highlighting the impact of signal energy modeling accuracy. Based on that, we further proposed two practical energy modeling schemes for ULT of visual signals. Experimental results show that the proposed schemes improve the quality of reconstructed images by 3~5 dB, while reducing the signal modeling overhead from hundreds or thousands of meta data to only a few meta data. The perceptual quality of reconstruction is significantly improved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Distortion Optimization for Uncoded Linear Transformed Transmission of Images and Videos","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2016.2621478","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7743013/07707379.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2016.2621478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7743013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707379","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Power Distortion Optimization for Uncoded Linear Transformed Transmission of Images and Videos","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7707379/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16481635","pubMedId":"27810810","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2015CB351800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370114, 61631017 and 61421062"},{"fundingName":"Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Distortion Optimization for Uncoded Linear Transformed Transmission of Images and Videos","sourcePdf":"tip-xiong-2621478-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164976S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7743013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7743013","articleId":"7707379","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7707381,"authors":[{"name":"Anas Chaaban","affiliation":["Division of Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7818052/7707381/chaab-2621743-small.gif","p":["Anas Chaaban (S\u201909\u2013M\u201914) received the Ma\u00eetrise \u00e8s Sciences degree in electronics from Lebanese University, Lebanon, in 2006, the M.Sc. degree in communications technology and the Dr. Ing.

Multi-input multi-output OWC systems can also be transformed, possibly with some performance loss, to parallel channels using pre-/post-coding. Studying the performance of such MC-OWC systems requires characterizing the capacity of the underlying parallel channels. In this paper, upper and lower bounds on the capacity of constant parallel OWC channels with a total average intensity constraint are derived. Then, this paper focuses on finding intensity allocations that maximize the lower bounds given channel-state information at the transmitter (CSIT). Due to its nonconvexity, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are used to describe a list of candidate allocations. Instead searching exhaustively for the best solution, low-complexity near-optimal algorithms are proposed. The resulting optimized lower bound nearly coincides with capacity at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Under a quasi-static channel model and in the absence of CSIT, outage probability upper and lower bounds are derived. Those bounds also meet at high SNR, thus characterizing the outage capacity in this regime. Finally, the results are extended to a system with both average and peak intensity constraints.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2621743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2621743","startPage":"296","endPage":"311","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7818052/07707381.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7818052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Parallel Optical Wireless Channels: Capacity Results and Outage Formulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Parallel Optical Wireless Channels: Capacity Results and Outage Formulation","volume":"65","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16598325","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7707381/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation)","grantNumber":"NPRP 9-077-2-036"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Limits of Parallel Optical Wireless Channels: Capacity Results and Outage Formulation","sourcePdf":"tcomm-chaaban-2621743-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.261268S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7818052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7818052","articleId":"7707381","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7707384,"authors":[{"name":"Ziv Goldfeld","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Ziv Goldfeld (S\u201913) received his B.Sc.

One common and two private messages are transmitted and the private message to the cooperative user should be kept secret from the cooperation-aided user. The secrecy level is measured in terms of strong secrecy, i.e., a vanishing information leakage. An inner bound on the capacity region is derived by using a channel-resolvability-based code that double-bins the codebook of the secret message, and by using a likelihood encoder to choose the transmitted codeword. The inner bound is shown to be tight for semideterministic and physically degraded BCs, and the results are compared with those of the corresponding BCs without a secrecy constraint. Black well and Gaussian BC examples illustrate the impact of secrecy on the rate regions. Unlike the case without secrecy, where sharing information about both private messages via the cooperative link is optimal, our protocol conveys parts of the common and non-confidential messages only. This restriction reduces the transmission rates more than the usual rate loss due to secrecy requirements. An example that illustrates this loss is provided.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7792231/07707384.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"495","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2016.2622058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2016.2622058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7792231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strong Secrecy for Cooperative Broadcast Channels","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/7792231/7707384-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707384/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Strong Secrecy for Cooperative Broadcast Channels","htmlLink":"/document/7707384/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16636513","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Cyber Security Research Center within the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council under the European Union\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC grant","grantNumber":"337752"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israel Science Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt Professorship endowed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1350595 and CCF-1116013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-15-1-0180 and FA9550-12-1-0196"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Strong Secrecy for Cooperative Broadcast Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-goldfeld-2622058-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147893S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7792231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7792231","articleId":"7707384","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7707387,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Jokar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Jokar","id":"37061415100"},{"name":"Hamid Soleimani","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Soleimani","orcid":"0000-0003-1424-4359","id":"37718173000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7707387","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological system modeling","Calcium","Mathematical model","Biological information theory","Biological neural networks","Brain modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calcium","field programmable gate arrays","neural nets","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field-programmable gate array","MATLAB simulations","neuronal stimulation protocols","calcium oscillations","minimal neural network","biological dynamics","digital circuit","synaptic plasticity","brain","temporal dynamics","intracellular ion","calcium-based plasticity model","digital multiplierless realization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Calcium-based plasticity model","fieldprogrammable gate array (FPGA)","spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707387","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7956382/07707387.pdf","startPage":"832","endPage":"836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2016.2621823","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2016.2621823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7956382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Multiplierless Realization of a Calcium-Based Plasticity Model","abstract":"Calcium is a highly widespread and versatile intracellular ion that can control a wide range of temporal dynamics in the brain such as synaptic plasticity.

Intuitively, a strong memory fault tolerance can be leveraged to reduce the fabrication cost of DRAM dies, and the total cost will reduce if the fabrication cost saving can off-set the cost overhead of memory fault tolerance. Nevertheless, such a simple concept can be a practically viable option only for 3D DRAM because: (1) The stacked logic die can solely implement memory fault tolerance inside 3D DRAM chips, obviating any changes on the host CPUs and CPU-DRAM interfaces. (2) With the total ownership of both the logic die and DRAM dies inside 3D DRAM chips, DRAM manufacturers can fully exploit the potential to truly minimize the 3D DRAM bit cost. Following this intuition, we developed a 3D DRAM fault tolerance design strategy. It can achieve a very strong tolerance to weak DRAM cells at very small redundancy and latency overhead. The key is to cohesively leverage the detectability of weak cells and runtime configurability of error correction code (ECC) decoding. In addition, this design strategy can gracefully embrace the inaccuracy of weak cell detection (e.g., weak cell miss-detection and false-detection). We carried out thorough mathematical analysis, and the results show that, under the redundancy overhead of 1:8 (same as today's ECC DIMM), this design strategy can tolerate the weak cell rate of as high as 10-4 and 6x10-5 if 100 and 90 percent of all the weak cells are known in prior. Using Micron's hybrid memory cube (HMC) 3D DRAM chips as the test vehicle, we evaluated the implementation cost and the results show that it only consumes less than 0.4 mm2 (45 nm node) on the logic die. Using CPU and DRAM simulators, we further carried out simulations over a variety of computing benchmarks and the results show that this design solution only incurs less than 2 percent performance degradation on average.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2016.2621758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2016.2621758","startPage":"820","endPage":"833","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7893086/07707388.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7893086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving 3D DRAM Fault Tolerance Through Weak Cell Aware Error Correction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Improving 3D DRAM Fault Tolerance Through Weak Cell Aware Error Correction","volume":"66","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16824249","publicationDate":"1 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7707388/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving 3D DRAM Fault Tolerance Through Weak Cell Aware Error Correction","sourcePdf":"tc-wang-2621758-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119112S","chronDate":"May 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7893086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7893086","articleId":"7707388","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7707397,"authors":[{"name":"Venkata Narayana Rao Vanukuru","affiliation":["Design Enablement Team GLOBALFOUNDRIES India, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Venkata Narayana Rao","lastName":"Vanukuru","orcid":"0000-0001-7183-5513","id":"37085367103"},{"name":"Vamsi Krishna Velidi","affiliation":["ISAC, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Vamsi Krishna","lastName":"Velidi","id":"37397424300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7707397","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":670},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering theory","Metals","CMOS process","Wideband","Resonator filters","Microstrip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-stop filters","CMOS integrated circuits","microstrip filters","millimetre wave filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact millimeter-wave CMOS wideband three-transmission-zeros bandstop filter","single coupled-line unit","millimeter-wave ultrawide bandstop filter","coupled-line resonator","lossless transmission model","thin-film microstrip structure","size 0.18 mum","frequency 60 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandstop filters (BSFs)","CMOS technology","coupled-line (CL)","millimeter-wave systems","thin-film microstrip structure (TFMS)","transmission zeros"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents the design and implementation of millimeter-wave ultra-wide bandstop filter (BSF) using a standard 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS technology.

Analog and mixed-signal implementations have proven to be suitable for applications in high-speed image processing, robot control, medical signal processing, and many more. Especially digital emulations on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) allow the development of general-purpose computers based on the CNN universal machine with an inherently parallel structure, a high degree of flexibility and a superior computational precision. However, these emulations turn out to be inefficient for the execution of binary operations, which account for more than two-thirds of all processing steps in a typical CNN algorithm. In this contribution, we present an architecture for the emulation of CNNs that supports both a fast and efficient processing of binary images, and a high computational accuracy when needed. With the FPGA implementation of this architecture, a speed-up factor of up to 5 is achieved for binary-data operations.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2016.2621773","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8423543/07707398.pdf","startPage":"1084","endPage":"1088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8423543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2016.2621773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Cellular Nonlinear Network Architecture for Binary and Grayscale Image Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707398","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Cellular Nonlinear Network Architecture for Binary and Grayscale Image Processing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707398/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17989837","htmlLink":"/document/7707398/","volume":"65","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Cellular Nonlinear Network Architecture for Binary and Grayscale Image Processing","sourcePdf":"tcsii-muller-2621773-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058819S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8423543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8423543","articleId":"7707398","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7707399,"authors":[{"name":"Junbo Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electric Power, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/7951114/7707399/zhang-2621127-small.gif","p":["Junbo Zhang (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914) was born in Guizhou, China,\n on March 16, 1986.

However, due to the inherent properties of power systems - nonlinearity, time variance, and collinearity - the effective data that carry the sensitivity information are insufficient. Consequently, the online SI information collected with existing methods may result in unexpected estimates. In this paper, a sufficient effective data condition that guarantees the success of online SI is proposed. The inherent properties of power systems and their impacts on this condition are then investigated. A series of metrics to qualify online whether the data meet the condition is put forward to assess the online SI results. A method is also proposed to select the effective data to improve the online computational efficiency. Finally, the findings and methods are validated in an eight-generator 36-node bus system with operations data recorded from actual power systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensitivity","Silicon","Power system stability","Mathematical model","Explosions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system identification","regression analysis","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system sensitivity identification","data quality","inherent system properties","online SI information","eight-generator 36-node bus system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data quality","data collinearity","data explosion","locally weighted linear regression (LWLR)","sensitivity identification (SI)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2621127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7951114/07707399.pdf","startPage":"2756","endPage":"2766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2621127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power System Sensitivity Identification\u2014Inherent System Properties and Data Quality","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power System Sensitivity Identification\u2014Inherent System Properties and Data Quality","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707399/","volume":"32","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7707399/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16969904","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51607071"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China","grantNumber":"2016A030313477"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"417639"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005015","fundingName":"South China University of Technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004147","fundingName":"Tsinghua University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008920","fundingName":"University of Saskatchewan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power System Sensitivity Identification\u2014Inherent System Properties and Data Quality","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-zhang-2621127-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134477S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7951114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7951114","articleId":"7707399","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7707400,"authors":[{"name":"Sudharsan Parthasarathy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Sudharsan","lastName":"Parthasarathy","orcid":"0000-0003-3236-9016","id":"37086109333"},{"name":"Radha Krishna Ganti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Radha Krishna","lastName":"Ganti","id":"37295146000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7707400","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":763},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rician channels","Base stations","Shape","Rayleigh channels","Nakagami distribution","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","fading channels","Nakagami channels","numerical analysis","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coverage analysis","downlink Poisson cellular network","\u03ba-\u03bc shadowed fading","downlink coverage probability","base station locations","Poisson point process","Nakagami distributed channel","integer shape parameter","fading distributions","numerical simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stochastic geometry","\u03ba\u2013\u03bc shadowed fading","coverage probability","poisson cellular network"]}],"abstract":"The downlink coverage probability of a cellular network, when the base station locations are modeled by a Poisson point process, is known when the desired channel is Nakagami distributed with an integer shape parameter.

When applied to speaker adaptation, we aim at transfer learning from a well-trained deep model for a \u201cgeneral\u201d usage to a \u201cpersonalized\u201d model geared toward a particular talker by using a collection of speaker-specific data. To make the framework applicable to practical situations, we perform adaptation in an unsupervised manner assuming that the transcriptions of the adaptation utterances are not readily available to the ASR system. We conduct a series of comprehensive batch adaptation experiments on the Switchboard ASR task and show that the proposed approach is effective even with CD-DNN-HMM built with discriminative sequential training. Indeed, MAP speaker adaptation reduces the word error rate (WER) to 20.1% from an initial 21.9% on the full NIST 2000 Hub5 benchmark test set. Moreover, MAP speaker adaptation compares favorably with other techniques evaluated on the same speech tasks. We also demonstrate its complementarity to other approaches by applying MAP adaptation to CD-DNN-HMM trained with speaker adaptive features generated through constrained maximum likelihood linear regression and further reduces the WER to 18.6%. Leveraging upon the intrinsic recursive nature in Bayesian adaptation and mitigating possible system constraints on batch learning, we also proposed an incremental approach to unsupervised online speaker adaptation by simultaneously updating the hyperparameters of the approximate posterior densities and the DNN parameters sequentially. The advantage of such a sequential learning algorithm over a batch method is not necessarily in the final performance, but in computational efficiency and reduced storage needs, without having to wait for all the data to be processed. So far, the experimental results are promising.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Unsupervised Batch and Online Speaker Adaptation of Activation Function Parameters in Deep Models for Automatic Speech Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2016.2621669","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/7756694/07707403.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2016.2621669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7756694","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707403/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Unsupervised Batch and Online Speaker Adaptation of Activation Function Parameters in Deep Models for Automatic Speech Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7707403/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16499469","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Unsupervised Batch and Online Speaker Adaptation of Activation Function Parameters in Deep Models for Automatic Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"taslp-siniscalchi-2621669-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140771S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7756694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7756694","articleId":"7707403","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7707405,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Jin","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7739934/7707405/jin-2614802-small.gif","p":["Xin Jin received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, in 2013.

Unfortunately, the performance of the sensors, as a function of NP geometry and glucose oxidase distribution, is not fully understood, making it difficult to optimize the sensors generally. In this paper, we derive an analytical relationship that explicitly correlates sensor performance to the elementary properties of the electrodes and oxidase. The compact model quantitatively reproduces the redox current associated with NP-based glucose sensors based on carbon nanotube and graphene-petal substrates that have previously been reported in the literature. The model will facilitate predictive design and optimization of NP-based amperometric biosensors that can eventually be integrated into wearable platforms.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/16/7739934/7707405-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707405/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7707405/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16486052","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Compact Modeling of Nanoparticle-Based Amperometric Glucose Biosensors","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation Center through the Nano-Engineered Electronic Devices Program","grantNumber":"1227020-EEC"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Generalized Compact Modeling of Nanoparticle-Based Amperometric Glucose Biosensors","sourcePdf":"ted-jin-2614802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068467S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7739934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7739934","articleId":"7707405","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7707409,"authors":[{"name":"Ang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Ang","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0001-8235-7596","id":"37085481022"},{"name":"Christos Masouros","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Masouros","id":"37299872300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7707409","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2256},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707409","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Precoding","Radio frequency","Algorithm design and analysis","Baseband","Antennas","Complexity theory","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid analog-digital millimeter-wave MU-MIMO transmission","virtual path selection","low-complexity hybrid precoding","analog precoding","combining design","decoupled approach","joint approach","suboptimal approach","channel gain maximization","low-dimensional zero-forcing precoding","performance-complexity tradeoff enhancement","fully digital schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mmWave-MIMO","hybrid design","precoding","combining"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose a low-complexity hybrid precoding and combining design for the millimeter-wave MU-MIMO transmission, applicable to both fully connected and sub-connected structures.

In the IVSVM scheme, an improved virtual medium vector (VMV) is synthesized by the original medium vector and the adjacent two pairs of the small vectors since there are always two pairs of the small vectors in any regions of the new space vector diagram. The improved VMV provides the flexibility to control the NP balancing under any modulation indexes and power factors in one switching cycle while achieving SL reduction and CMV suppression. This is achieved by the proper selection of two pairs of small vectors in terms of NP charge and the pulse sequence. The experimental platform based on a 3L-ANPC inverter is established and results obtained to verify the effectiveness of the IVSVM control strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2016.2621776","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7924296/07707410.pdf","startPage":"7419","endPage":"7434","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2016.2621776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7924296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Virtual Space Vector Modulation Scheme for Three-Level Active Neutral-Point-Clamped Inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Virtual Space Vector Modulation Scheme for Three-Level Active Neutral-Point-Clamped Inverter","volume":"32","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16880303","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7707410/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51307002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Virtual Space Vector Modulation Scheme for Three-Level Active Neutral-Point-Clamped Inverter","sourcePdf":"tpel-hu-2621776-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08981S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7924296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7924296","articleId":"7707410","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7707412,"authors":[{"name":"Xin-Bo Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Xi\u2019an Polytechnic University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7778258/7707412/huang-2621415-small.gif","p":["Xin-Bo Huang was born in Shandong, China, in 1975.

For the absence of an effective contamination sensor, the flashover problem has not been effectively resolved yet. In this paper, a new equivalent salt deposit density (ESDD) optical fiber sensor for transmission lines is designed and deployed, which consists of micro-controller unit, A/D converter, quartz fiber, photodiode, laser module, data flash memory, solar panel, sensors of temperature and humidity, communication module, and so forth. To obtain the relationship between the optical energy attenuation and the contamination, plenty of experiments are carried out, based on which the back-propagation (BP) neural network model was trained. The results of artificial experiments indicate that the error of sensors could be less than 10%, and the BP neural network model achieves relatively higher accuracy. The type tests are also carried out, in which the errors of both ESDD and non-soluble deposit density are less than 10%. Finally, the ESDD online monitoring system for transmission lines is deployed and provides an accurate measurement of the insulator contamination.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707412/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2017","volume":"17","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16524283","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7707412/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Equivalent Salt Deposit Density Optical Fiber Sensor for Transmission Lines in Power Grid","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51177115"},{"fundingName":"Project of Key Science and Technology Innovation Team of Shaanxi","grantNumber":"2014KCT-16"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equivalent Salt Deposit Density Optical Fiber Sensor for Transmission Lines in Power Grid","sourcePdf":"jsen-huang-2621415-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091447S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7778258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7778258","articleId":"7707412","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7707413,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Esmaeili-Najafabadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7753033/7707413/najaf-2621728-small.gif","p":["Hamid Esmaeili-Najafabadi (S\u201907) received the B.S. degree in\n electronics and the M.S. degree in communication from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, and Amirkabir\n University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

The PSL of the autocorrelation is regarded as the main merit and is optimized through newly introduced cyclic algorithms, namely, PSL minimization quadratic approach, PSL minimization algorithm where the smallest rectangular, and PSL optimization cyclic algorithm. It is revealed that minimizing PSL results in better sequences in terms of autocorrelation side lobes when compared with traditional integrated side-lobe level minimization. In order to improve the performance of these algorithms, fast-randomized singular value decomposition is utilized. To achieve waveform design for MIMO radars, this algorithm is applied to the waveform generated from a modified Bernoulli chaotic system. The numerical experiments confirm the superiority of the newly developed algorithms compared to high-performance algorithms in monostatic and MIMO radars.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2621728","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7753033/07707413.pdf","startPage":"690","endPage":"704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2621728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing Sequence With Minimum PSL Using Chebyshev Distance and its Application for Chaotic MIMO Radar Waveform Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707413/","displayDocTitle":"Designing Sequence With Minimum PSL Using Chebyshev Distance and its Application for Chaotic MIMO Radar Waveform Design","volume":"65","issue":"3","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16486382","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7707413/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing Sequence With Minimum PSL Using Chebyshev Distance and its Application for Chaotic MIMO Radar Waveform Design","sourcePdf":"tsp-ataei-2621728-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100348S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7753033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7753033","articleId":"7707413","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7707414,"authors":[{"name":"Louis Sibomana","affiliation":["University of Rwanda, Butare, Rwanda"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/8000754/7707414/sibom-2621760-small.gif","p":["Louis Sibomana received the BS degree in electronics and\n communication engineering and the MS degree in information and communication technology from the National University\n of Rwanda, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, and the PhD degree from the Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden, in\n May 2016.

The transmit power of the SU transmitter is subject to the joint outage constraint imposed by the primary user receivers (PU-Rxs) and the SU maximum transmit power limit. The analysis considers a queueing model for secondary traffic with multiple classes, and different types of arrival and service processes under a non-preemptive priority service discipline. The SU quality of service (QoS) is characterized by a packet timeout threshold and target bit error rate. Given these settings, analytical expressions of the packet timeout probability and average transmission time are derived for opportunistic and multicast scheduling. Moreover, expressions of the average packet waiting time in the queue and the total time in the system for each class of traffic are obtained. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the secondary network performance with respect to various parameters such as number of PU-Rxs and SU receivers, SU packet arrival process, QoS requirements, and the impact of interference from the primary network to the secondary network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17149436","htmlLink":"/document/7707414/","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Packet Delay Analysis of Point-to-Multipoint Underlay Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for Packet Delay Analysis of Point-to-Multipoint Underlay Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-sibomana-2621760-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172967S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"8000754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8000754","articleId":"7707414","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7707417,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaocheng Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaocheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404925700"},{"name":"Wendong Liu","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wendong","lastName":"Liu","id":"38239886300"},{"name":"Chen Qian","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Qian","id":"38244081400"},{"name":"Sheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K.","King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277597300"},{"name":"Lajos Hanzo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Hanzo","id":"37276255400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7707417","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1334},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Precoding","Three-dimensional displays","Interference","Array signal processing","MIMO","Two dimensional displays","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","channel coding","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","precoding","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D precoding scheme","3D massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","3D massive MIMO","2D antenna array","base station","Kronecker structure","3D MIMO channel matrix","elevation-domain precoding","azimuth-domain precoding","beamforming schemes","interuser interference","intercell interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interuser interference","Kronecker structure","precoding","2-D precoding","3-D massive multiple-input multiple-output (MMIMO)"]}],"abstract":"A 2-D precoding scheme is proposed for 3-D massive multiple-input multiple-output (MMIMO) systems for efficiently exploiting the 2-D antenna array of the base station.

Explicitly, in contrast to the existing beamforming schemes, precoding is also performed in the vertical dimension. Consequently, the proposed scheme is capable of fully exploiting the extra degrees of freedom provided by the vertical dimension for avoiding the interuser interference to improve the attainable system performance.

They improve upon the stability and noise shaping characteristics of conventional 1-bit \u03a3-\u0394 modulators by minimizing quantization error metrics of the current and future output samples. The mathematical model of the proposed MSLA modulators is analyzed. It is shown that the MSLA modulators are equivalent to a system of conventional \u03a3-\u0394 modulators in parallel, but with a common multi-input 1-bit quantizer instead of a typical one. The properties of this multi-input quantizer are studied and the transfer functions of the MSLA modulators are derived. Simulation results are presented demonstrating the advantages of the MSLA modulators over conventional 1-bit \u03a3-\u0394 ones in a number of applications. A parametric hardware architecture of the MSLA modulators is presented offering an adjustable trade-off between performance and hardware complexity based on the number of look-ahead steps. Finally, a FPGA implementation of a MSLA modulator is presented along with simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707423/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","volume":"64","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16618470","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7707423/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Class of 1-Bit Multi-Step Look-Ahead $\\Sigma $ - $\\Delta $ Modulators","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008500","fundingName":"Broadcom Foundation USA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Class of 1-Bit Multi-Step Look-Ahead $\\Sigma $ - $\\Delta $ Modulators","sourcePdf":"tcsi-basetas-2608922-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109538S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7809129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7809129","articleId":"7707423","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7707429,"authors":[{"name":"Mehran Mozaffari Kermani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Microelectronic Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7809129/7707429/mozaf-2610187-small.gif","p":["Mehran Mozaffari Kermani (S\u201900\u2013M\u201911\u2013SM\u201916) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2005, and the M.E.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, in 2007 and 2011, respectively.

Moreover, the algorithm has been applied to automatic speech recognition and storage devices. In this paper, efficient error detection schemes for architectures based on low-latency, low-complexity Viterbi decoders are presented. The merit of the proposed schemes is that reliability requirements, overhead tolerance, and performance degradation limits are embedded in the structures and can be adapted accordingly. We also present three variants of recomputing with encoded operands and its modifications to detect both transient and permanent faults, coupled with signature-based schemes. The instrumented decoder architecture has been subjected to extensive error detection assessments through simulations, and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) [32 nm library] and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) [Xilinx Virtex-6 family] implementations for benchmark. The proposed fine-grained approaches can be utilized based on reliability objectives and performance/implementation metrics degradation tolerance.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2610187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7809129/07707429.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2610187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable Low-Latency Viterbi Algorithm Architectures Benchmarked on ASIC and FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Reliable Low-Latency Viterbi Algorithm Architectures Benchmarked on ASIC and FPGA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707429/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16618469","htmlLink":"/document/7707429/","volume":"64","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable Low-Latency Viterbi Algorithm Architectures Benchmarked on ASIC and FPGA","sourcePdf":"tcsi-mozaffarikermani-2610187-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082981S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7809129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7809129","articleId":"7707429","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7707441,"authors":[{"name":"Pascal Vivet","affiliation":["CEA-LETI, MINATEC Grenoble, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7811159/7707441/vivet-2611497-small.gif","p":["Pascal Vivet received the Ph.D. degree from the Grenoble Polytechnic Institute in 2001, where he was involved in designing an asynchronous microprocessor.","After four years with STMicroelectronics, he joined the Digital Design Laboratory, CEA-LETI, Grenoble, France, in 2003, where he is currently a Senior Expert.

In this paper, we present a 3D modular and scalable network-on-chip (NoC) architecture implemented using robust asynchronous logic. The 3DNOC circuit targets a Telecom long-term evolution application; it is composed of two die layers, fabricated in 65 nm technology using TSV middle aspect ratio 1:8, and integrates ESD protection, a 3D design-for-test, and a fault tolerant scheme. The 3D links achieve 0.66 pJ/b energy consumption and 326 Mb/s data rate per pin for the parallel link. Thin die effect is demonstrated by thermal analysis and measurements, as well as the dynamic self-adaptation of the 3D link performances with 3D thermal conditions. Finally, the scalability of the 3DNOC circuit, in terms of power delivery network and thermal dissipation, is demonstrated by using simulations up to a 3D stack of eight die layers.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2016.2611497","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7811159/07707441.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2016.2611497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7811159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A $4 \\times 4 \\times 2$ Homogeneous Scalable 3D Network-on-Chip Circuit With 326 MFlit/s 0.66 pJ/b Robust and Fault Tolerant Asynchronous 3D Links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707441/","displayDocTitle":"A $4 \\times 4 \\times 2$ Homogeneous Scalable 3D Network-on-Chip Circuit With 326 MFlit/s 0.66 pJ/b Robust and Fault Tolerant Asynchronous 3D Links","volume":"52","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16584871","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7707441/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"French National Program Programme d\u2019Investissements d\u2019Avenir, IRT Nanoelec","grantNumber":"ANR-10-AIRT-05"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A $4 \\times 4 \\times 2$ Homogeneous Scalable 3D Network-on-Chip Circuit With 326 MFlit/s 0.66 pJ/b Robust and Fault Tolerant Asynchronous 3D Links","sourcePdf":"jssc-vivet-2611497-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.195103S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7811159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7811159","articleId":"7707441","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7707442,"authors":[{"name":"Isaac Abraham","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7707442/abrah-2621721-small.gif","p":["Isaac Abraham (M\u201915) received the master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering with specialization in VLSI and control systems from Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA, in 1998.","He is currently a Staff Analog Engineer and Analog Tech Lead with Intel Corporation, where he is involved in analog IO interfaces for DDR."]},"firstName":"Isaac","lastName":"Abraham","orcid":"0000-0001-8846-013X","id":"37086619343"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2169-3536"}],"articleNumber":"7707442","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":551},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/index.html"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"Vacancy migration model.

The model also reveals implicit complex resistors that cause the fleeting negative resistance characteristic in the memristor, as observed by Chua. Elegant closed-form solutions with remarkable scope are produced even under simplified modeling conditions. Numerical methods verify the closed form model.

However, the performances of predictive models are greatly affected when the real-world data set is highly imbalanced. A data set is called imbalanced if the samples size from one class is very much smaller or larger than the other classes. The most commonly used technique is over/under sampling for handling the class-imbalance problem (CIP) in various domains. In this paper, we survey six well-known sampling techniques and compare the performances of these key techniques, i.e., mega-trend diffusion function (MTDF), synthetic minority oversampling technique, adaptive synthetic sampling approach, couples top-N reverse k-nearest neighbor, majority weighted minority oversampling technique, and immune centroids oversampling technique. Moreover, this paper also reveals the evaluation of four rules-generation algorithms (the learning from example module, version 2 (LEM2), covering, exhaustive, and genetic algorithms) using publicly available data sets. The empirical results demonstrate that the overall predictive performance of MTDF and rules-generation based on genetic algorithms performed the best as compared with the rest of the evaluated oversampling methods and rule-generation algorithms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Prediction algorithms","Genetic algorithms","Sampling methods","Customer retention","Learning systems","Customer satisfaction","Customer profiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["customer relationship management","data handling","genetic algorithms","organisational aspects","sampling methods","service industries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["immune centroids oversampling","majority weighted minority oversampling","couples top-N reverse k-nearest neighbor","adaptive synthetic sampling","synthetic minority oversampling","mega-trend diffusion function","class imbalance problem","genetic algorithms","rule-generation algorithms","customer retention process","telecom industry","service-based organizations","customer retention","customer churn prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SMOTE","ADASYN","mega trend diffusion function","class imbalance","rough set","customer churn","mRMR.

To solve this problem, the joint design of training-based channel estimation and cluster formation are studied in this paper. To provide efficient cooperation strategies in C-RANs, individual C-RAN clusters are formed by the remote radio heads (RRHs), and a data-assisted channel estimation scheme is studied, which can reduce the redundant cost of training sequences. To ensure the performance of channel estimation and data transmissions, the cluster formation and the channel estimation are optimized jointly. In particular, an iterative training-based channel estimation scheme is designed by using convex optimization and the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm jointly. Moreover, a utility function of cluster formation can be established based on the estimates and the mean squared error of our proposed channel estimation algorithm, and the cluster formation of RRHs can be formulated as a coalitional formation game. Furthermore, a sub-optimal algorithm is also proposed to reduce the computational complexity. Finally, the simulation results are shown to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07707458.pdf","startPage":"9643","endPage":"9658","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2621819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2621819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Design of Iterative Training-Based Channel Estimation and Cluster Formation in Cloud-Radio Access Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707458/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","displayDocTitle":"Joint Design of Iterative Training-Based Channel Estimation and Cluster Formation in Cloud-Radio Access Networks","htmlLink":"/document/7707458/","publicationDate":"2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16606977","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501045"},{"fundingName":"State Major Science and Technology Special Projects","grantNumber":"2016ZX03001017-004"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2014AA01A707"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Design of Iterative Training-Based Channel Estimation and Cluster Formation in Cloud-Radio Access Networks","sourcePdf":"access-zhao-2621819-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096246S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7707458","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7707459,"authors":[{"name":"Steven Platnick","affiliation":["Earth Sciences Division, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7762241/7707459/platn-2610522-small.gif","p":["Steven Platnick received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Duke University, Durham, NC, USA, in 1979, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, in 1980, and the Ph.D. degree in atmospheric sciences from the University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA, in 1991.","He held engineering positions at Hewlett-Packard Company for six years and was a National Research Council Resident Research Associate with NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, Santa Rosa, CA, USA.

Collection 6 (C6) reprocessing of the product was completed in May 2014 and March 2015 for MODIS Aqua and Terra, respectively. Here we provide an overview of major C6 optical property algorithm changes relative to the previous Collection 5 (C5) product. Notable C6 optical and microphysical algorithm changes include: 1) new ice cloud optical property models and a more extensive cloud radiative transfer code lookup table (LUT) approach; 2) improvement in the skill of the shortwave-derived cloud thermodynamic phase; 3) separate cloud effective radius retrieval data sets for each spectral combination used in previous collections; 4) separate retrievals for partly cloudy pixels and those associated with cloud edges; 5) failure metrics that provide diagnostic information for pixels having observations that fall outside the LUT solution space; and 6) enhanced pixel-level retrieval uncertainty calculations. The C6 algorithm changes can collectively result in significant changes relative to C5, though the magnitude depends on the data set and the pixel's retrieval location in the cloud parameter space. Example L2 granule and level-3 gridded data set differences between the two collections are shown. While the emphasis is on the suite of cloud optical property data sets, other MODIS cloud data sets are discussed when relevant.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","MODIS","Optical

In contrast to the existing methods that are mostly derived from the Neumann series expansion framework, additional coefficients have been introduced in our proposed method to enhance the precision of approximation. We propose an efficient algorithm for the coefficient design, which consists of an eigenvalue estimation procedure derived from random matrix theory, and a least-squares fitting procedure that solves a low-dimensional overdetermined system of linear equations. Complexity analysis and simulation results show that our eigen-based MIA method exhibits practically comparable computational complexity, while achieving substantial performance enhancement compared to other benchmark methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Eigen-Based Approach for Enhancing Matrix Inversion Approximation in Massive MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2622010","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7951139/07707460.pdf","startPage":"5480","endPage":"5484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2622010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707460/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"An Eigen-Based Approach for Enhancing Matrix Inversion Approximation in Massive MIMO Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7707460/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16965037","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"104-2622-E-194-004-CC1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Eigen-Based Approach for Enhancing Matrix Inversion Approximation in Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2622010-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07174S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7707460","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7707461,"authors":[{"name":"Mikkel H\u00f8yerby","affiliation":["Merus Audio, Herlev, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7756673/7707461/hoyer-2600251-small.gif","p":["Mikkel H\u00f8yerby (M\u201906) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark, in 2004, and the industrial Ph.D. degree from the Technical University of Denmark in co-operation with Motorola, in 2010, working in-between as a Research Assistant in the field of power electronics.","From 2009 to 2010, he was a Research Engineer in the field of radio frequency (RF) power amplifier linearization with Motorola Solutions, Copenhagen, Denmark.

The proposed estimator, called measure-transformed GQMLE (MT-GQMLE), minimizes the empirical Kullback-Leibler divergence between a transformed probability distribution of the data and a hypothesized Gaussian probability measure. By judicious choice of the transform we show that, unlike the GQMLE, the proposed estimator can gain sensitivity to higher order statistical moments and resilience to outliers leading to significant mitigation of the model mismatch effect on the estimates. Under some mild regularity conditions, we show that the MT-GQMLE is consistent, asymptotically normal and unbiased. Furthermore, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic efficiency. A data driven procedure for optimal selection of the measure transformation parameters is developed that minimizes the trace of an empirical estimate of the asymptotic mean-squared-error matrix. The MT-GQMLE is applied to linear regression and source localization and numerical comparisons illustrate its robustness and resilience to outliers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2017","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16486377","htmlLink":"/document/7707462/","displayDocTitle":"Measure-Transformed Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001742","fundingName":"United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014334"},{"fundingName":"United States MURI","grantNumber":"W911NF-15-1-0479"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measure-Transformed Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimation","sourcePdf":"tsp-todros-2621732-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132817S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7753033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7753033","articleId":"7707462","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7707463,"authors":[{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Rottenberg","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles, Brussel, Belgium","ICTEAM, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7753033/7707463/rotte-2621722-small.gif","p":["Fran\u00e7ois Rottenberg (S\u201915) received the M.Sc. degree in\n electrical engineering from the Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain (UCL), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, in 2014.\n Since September 2014, he has been working toward the Ph.D. degree working part time at ICTEAM\u2014Universit\u00e9\n Catholique de Louvain and at OPERA\u2014Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles, Bruxelles, Belgium.

The users and the base station (BS) communicate using space division multiple access. The low complexity proposed solution is based on a single tap per-subcarrier precoding/decoding matrix at the BS in the downlink/uplink. As opposed to classical approaches that assume flat channel frequency selectivity at the subcarrier level, the BS does not make this assumption and takes into account the distortion caused by channel frequency selectivity. The expression of the FBMC asymptotic mean squared error (MSE) in the case of strong channel selectivity derived in earlier works is developed and extended. The linear precoders and decoders are found by optimizing the MSE formula under two design criteria, namely zero forcing or minimum MSE. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the performance of the optimized design. As long as the number of BS antennas is larger than the number of users, it is shown that those extra degrees of freedom can be used to compensate for the channel frequency selectivity.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2621722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7753033/07707463.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2621722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753033","startPage":"587","endPage":"600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Tap Precoders and Decoders for Multiuser MIMO FBMC-OQAM Under Strong Channel Frequency Selectivity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single-Tap Precoders and Decoders for Multiuser MIMO FBMC-OQAM Under Strong Channel Frequency Selectivity","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707463/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"3","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16486386","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7707463/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003134","fundingName":"Fonds pour la Formation \u00e0 la Recherche dans l\u2019Industrie et dans l\u2019Agriculture"},{"fundingName":"Catalan and Spanish governments","grantNumber":"2014SGR1567 and TEC2014-59255-C3-1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Tap Precoders and Decoders for Multiuser MIMO FBMC-OQAM Under Strong Channel Frequency Selectivity","sourcePdf":"tsp-rottenberg-2621722-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096021S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7753033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7753033","articleId":"7707463","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7707464,"authors":[{"name":"Ninghang Hu","affiliation":["University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, WX, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/8024097/7707464/hu-2621761-small.gif","p":["Ninghang Hu received the MSc degree in artificial intelligence from the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in 2011.

Typically, training such a system requires activity labels to be both completely and accurately annotated. In this paper, we go beyond such restriction and propose a learning method that allow labels to be incomplete and uncertain. We introduce the idea of soft labels which allows annotators to assign multiple, and weighted labels to data segments. This is very useful in many situations, e.g., when the labels are uncertain, when part of the labels are missing, or when multiple annotators assign inconsistent labels. We formulate the activity recognition task as a sequential labeling problem. Latent variables are embedded in the model in order to exploit sub-level semantics for better estimation. We propose a max-margin framework which incorporate soft labels for learning the model parameters. The model is evaluated on two challenging datasets. To simulate the uncertainty in data annotation, we randomly change the labels for transition segments. The results show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7707464/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2017","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17153712","pubMedId":"28113744","volume":"39","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Recognize Human Activities Using Soft Labels","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European project ACCOMPANY","grantNumber":"287624"},{"fundingName":"European project MONARCH","grantNumber":"601033"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Recognize Human Activities Using Soft Labels","sourcePdf":"tpami-hu-2621761-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085629S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"8024097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8024097","articleId":"7707464","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":7707465,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Arshad Nasir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7753033/7707465/nasir-2621719-small.gif","p":["Ali Arshad Nasir (S'09\u2013M'13) received the Ph.D.\n degree in telecommunications engineering from the Australian National University, Canberra, Australia, in 2013 and\n worked there as a Research Fellow from 2012 to 2015.

The primary concern in this work is the network internal security, where there may be a single multiantenna eavesdropper or there is a risk that any near user may accidentally eavesdrop on the received signal of any far user. The objective is to maximize the minimum secrecy user rate under BS transmit power and UE minimum harvested energy constraints. New path-following algorithms are proposed for computational solutions of these difficult nonconvex optimization problems. Each iteration involves one simple convex quadratic program. Numerical results confirm that the proposed algorithms converge quickly after few iterations having a low computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2621719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7753033/07707465.pdf","startPage":"677","endPage":"689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2621719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy Rate Beamforming for Multicell Networks With Information and Energy Harvesting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy Rate Beamforming for Multicell Networks With Information and Energy Harvesting","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707465/","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16486383","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7707465/","volume":"65","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.K. Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship","grantNumber":"RF1415\\14\\22"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrecy Rate Beamforming for Multicell Networks With Information and Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"tsp-duong-2621719-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.214677S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7753033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7753033","articleId":"7707465","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7707468,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7763897/7707468/liu-2621667-small.gif","p":["Yang Liu received the B.Eng. degree from the Xidian University of Technology, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2014.

However, most existing approaches solve the column vectors of the optimal projection matrix one by one with greedy strategy. Thus, the obtained optimal projection matrix does not necessarily best optimize the corresponding trace ratio objective function, which is the essential criterion function for general supervised dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we propose a non-greedy iterative algorithm to solve the trace ratio form of L1-norm-based linear discriminant analysis. We analyze the convergence of our proposed algorithm in detail. Extensive experiments on five popular image databases illustrate that our proposed algorithm can maximize the objective function value and is superior to most existing L1-LDA algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Non-Greedy Algorithm for L1-Norm LDA","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2016.2621667","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7763897/07707468.pdf","startPage":"684","endPage":"695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2016.2621667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7763897","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707468/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Non-Greedy Algorithm for L1-Norm LDA","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7707468/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16573429","pubMedId":"28113761","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271296 and 61125204"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China","grantNumber":"2012JM8002"},{"fundingName":"111 Project of China","grantNumber":"B08038"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2012M521747"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005320","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Non-Greedy Algorithm for L1-Norm LDA","sourcePdf":"tip-gao-2621667-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16593S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7763897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"7763897","articleId":"7707468","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7707469,"authors":[{"name":"Jamil Farhat","affiliation":["Federal University of Technology-Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7707469/farha-2622062-small.gif","p":["Jamil Farhat (S\u201915) was born in Joinville, Santa Catarina, Brazil, in 1990.

We assume that only the channel state information (CSI) of the legitimate channel is available, while the CSI with respect to the eavesdropper is unknown. Then, we propose a CSI-aided decode-and-forward (DF) scheme, in which the transmitter uses the available CSI in order to choose between direct and cooperative paths. Moreover, the relay employs either repetition coding (CSI-RC), i.e., source and relay use the same codebook, or parallel coding (CSI-PC), when different codebooks are used. By resorting to the Dinkelbach algorithm, we propose a joint power allocation scheme, which also optimizes \u03b8 to maximize the SEE. Our schemes are compared with the traditional DF, amplify- and-forward, and cooperative jamming (CJ). In most scenarios, CSI-RC performs best in terms of SEE. Nevertheless, we observe that CSI-PC achieves the highest SEE when \u03b8 \u2192 1 and if the relay is close to either the transmitter or the receiver. Moreover, CJ also stands out to maximize the SEE if the relay is placed closer to the eavesdropper. In addition, the influence of \u03b8 in the system performance is evaluated, showing that a joint \u03b8 and power optimization considerably improves the SEE.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2622062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07707469.pdf","endPage":"7288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency of Repetition Coding and Parallel Coding Relaying Under Partial Secrecy Regime","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2622062","startPage":"7275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency of Repetition Coding and Parallel Coding Relaying Under Partial Secrecy Regime","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707469/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16470598","publicationDate":"2016","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7707469/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002322","fundingName":"Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy Efficiency of Repetition Coding and Parallel Coding Relaying Under Partial Secrecy Regime","sourcePdf":"access-farhat-2622062-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163084S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7707469","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7707470,"authors":[{"name":"Kae Won Choi","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7707470/choi-2621766-small.gif","p":["Kae Won Choi (M\u201908\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S. degree in civil, urban, and geosystem engineering in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2003 and 2007, respectively.

We have implemented a real-life multi-antenna WPSN testbed and conducted extensive experiments on the testbed. The key technology for the high-efficiency WPSN is an adaptive energy beamforming scheme that dynamically steers a microwave beam towards a sensor node. We propose a receive power-based channel estimation and energy beamforming algorithm. In addition, an adaptive duty cycle control algorithm is proposed to prevent energy storage of a sensor node from being depleted. The proposed duty cycle control algorithm is designed based on a proportional-integral-derivative controller. These algorithms are all implemented in the multi-antenna WPSN testbed. By experiments, we validate the feasibility of the multi-antenna WPSN, and show the performance of the proposed algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless-Powered Sensor Networks: How to Realize","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2621766","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07707470.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2621766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707470/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Wireless-Powered Sensor Networks: How to Realize","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7707470/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618454","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Korean Government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"2014R1A5A1011478"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless-Powered Sensor Networks: How to Realize","sourcePdf":"twc-kim-2621766-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118213S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7707470","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7707471,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Gaafar","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Divison, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7707471/gaafa-2621767-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Gaafar (S\u201915) was born in Bani Souwaif, Egypt.

The self-interference introduced at the primary network may dramatically impede the secondary user (SU) opportunity to access the spectrum. To tackle this problem, we use the so-called improper Gaussian signaling. Particularly, we assume the downlink transmission of a SU that uses improper Gaussian signaling while the FD PU pair implements the regular proper Gaussian signaling. First, we derive a closed-form expression and an upper bound for the SU and PUs outage probabilities, respectively. Second, we optimize the SU signal parameters to minimize its outage probability while maintaining the required PUs quality-of-service based on the average channel state information (CSI). Moreover, we provide the conditions to reap merits from employing improper Gaussian signaling at the SU. Third, we design the SU signal parameters based on the perfect knowledge of its direct link instantaneous CSI and investigate all benefits that can be achieved at both the SU and PUs. Finally, we provide some numerical results that demonstrate the advantages of using improper Gaussian signaling to access the spectrum of the FD PUs.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2621767","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07707471.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2621767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","startPage":"235","endPage":"249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underlay Spectrum Sharing Techniques With In-Band Full-Duplex Systems Using Improper Gaussian Signaling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Underlay Spectrum Sharing Techniques With In-Band Full-Duplex Systems Using Improper Gaussian Signaling","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7707471/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618420","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7707471/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004052","fundingName":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underlay Spectrum Sharing Techniques With In-Band Full-Duplex Systems Using Improper Gaussian Signaling","sourcePdf":"twc-gaafar-2621767-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100803S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7707471","onlineDate":"26 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"}]
