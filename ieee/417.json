The derivation is based on a new communication scheme for wireless ad hoc networks utilizing the concept of cooperative many-to-many communication, called opportunistic cooperation, as opposed to the traditional approach that emphasizes on one-to-one communication. We demonstrate that the capacity of MANETs with multiple antennas is improved using cooperation as compared to non-cooperative schemes, i.e., point-to-point communication.

In conjunction with centralized processing, MIMO radar has the potential to significantly improve radar functions such as detection and parameter estimation. MIMO radar is distinct from other types of array radars such as phased array or STAP, which process the signals of closely spaced elements and, hence, cannot capitalize on the spatial characteristics of targets. In this work, we explore the ability of MIMO radar and coherent processing to locate a target with high resolution and to resolve targets located in the same range cell. A distributed target model is developed. It is demonstrated that MIMO radar with centralized coherent processing is able to resolve scatterers with a range resolution well beyond that supported by the signal bandwidth. The location estimation capabilities are further illustrated by introducing a new two-dimensional ambiguity function. The analysis is discussed in the context of established results for randomly thinned arrays. The investigation of high resolution MIMO radar also includes comparison with the performance of non-coherent MIMO radar and the effect on performance of the number of sensors and their locations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176505.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"30","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.356576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.356576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Resolution Capabilities of MIMO Radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal resolution","Phased arrays","Spatial resolution","Radar signal processing","Spaceborne radar","Signal processing","Radar scattering","Transmitters","Backscatter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","radar equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","radar backscatter","multistatic architecture","location estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"High Resolution Capabilities of MIMO Radar","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176505/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288335","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Resolution Capabilities of MIMO Radar","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074978S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4176508,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Yang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, MC 136-93, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chun-Yang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293085800"},{"name":"P.

In the MIMO radar system, the transmitter sends noncoherent (possibly orthogonal) broad (possibly omni-directional) waveforms. These waveforms can be extracted by a matched filterbank at the receiver. The extracted signals can be used to obtain more diversity or improve the clutter resolution. This paper focuses on space-time adaptive processing (STAP) for MlMO radar systems which improves the clutter resolution. The size of the MIMO STAP steering vector can be much larger than the traditional SIMO STAP steering vector because of the extra dimension. An accurate estimation of clutter rank for the subspace method is developed, and is a generalization of Brennan's rule to the MIMO radar case. A data independent method for estimating the clutter subspace is also described.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.356579","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176508.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.356579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","startPage":"41","endPage":"45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming issues in modern MIMO Radars with Doppler","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming issues in modern MIMO Radars with Doppler","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176508/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10285190","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4176508/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming issues in modern MIMO Radars with Doppler","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05605S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4176518,"authors":[{"name":"Teemu Pitkanen","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Teemu","lastName":"Pitkanen","id":"37294921700"},{"name":"Risto Makinen","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Risto","lastName":"Makinen","id":"37285972200"},{"name":"Jari Heikkinen","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Jari","lastName":"Heikkinen","id":"37298962600"},{"name":"Tero Partanen","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Tero","lastName":"Partanen","id":"37294909000"},{"name":"Jarmo Takala","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarmo","lastName":"Takala","id":"37275700700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176518","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Energy efficiency","Application specific integrated circuits","Software performance","Fast Fourier transforms","Energy consumption","Arithmetic","Computer aided instruction","Clocks","Flexible printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","fast Fourier transforms","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed-radix FFT","fast Fourier transform","transport triggered architecture processor","ASIC implementation","software implementation","programmable processor","complex-valued arithmetic","address computation","clock gating","radix-4 computations","radix-2 computations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176518","abstract":"Transport triggered architecture (TTA) offers a cost-effective trade-off between the energy-efficiency and performance of an ASIC implementation and the flexibility provided by a software implementation on a programmable processor.

While the proposed design performs as good as or better than random interleavers for various block-sizes, it improves the error floor of the Zigzag codes and offers a lot of parallelism suitable for high data-rate applications. The interleaver can be specified with only a few parameters and can be efficiently implemented in both hardware and software. We also evaluate semi-parallel Zigzag decoder architecture that exploits the parallelism of the proposed interleavers to improve the throughput. We also evaluate the performance of an efficient decoding schedule for semi-parallel Zigzag decoder that provides better throughput and performance trade-offs compared to the fully parallel and serial decoder schedule. The proposed interleaver scheme and architecture are suitable for high throughput Ultra Wideband communications that demand data-rates up to several hundred mbps.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.356592","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176521.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"104","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.356592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structured Interleavers and Decoder Architectures for Zigzag Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Structured Interleavers and Decoder Architectures for Zigzag Codes","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4176521/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288343","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176521/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structured Interleavers and Decoder Architectures for Zigzag Codes","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051442S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4176524,"authors":[{"name":"Adam L.

This ability of providing \" diversity gain\" can increase the capacity of ad hoc networks. Currently, most of the studies on MIMO links systems are focused on the physical layer without taking into consideration the intricacies of a network-wide deployment. In this work we study the benefits of a network-wide deployment of MIMO links in mobile ad hoc networks. In particular, we examine the trade-offs between using the possible diversity gain for an increase in range or an increase in rate. We make minor modifications to traditionally used MAC and routing schemes popularly considered for ad hoc networks and perform extensive simulations to understand the above trade-offs. We quantify the performance trade-offs in terms of the achieved throughput and end-to-end latency. Our studies can serve as a precursor to the design of adaptive schemes that can exploit the achievable diversity to increase range/rate depending on the scenario at hand.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.356596","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176525.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.356596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","startPage":"117","endPage":"121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Diversity Gain in MIMO Equipped Ad hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Diversity Gain in MIMO Equipped Ad hoc Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176525/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288346","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4176525/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Diversity Gain in MIMO Equipped Ad hoc Networks","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08036S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4176526,"authors":[{"name":"Yih-Hao Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yih-Hao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37292133200"},{"name":"Tara Javidi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tara","lastName":"Javidi","id":"37278949700"},{"name":"Rene L.

The objective is to design a scalable scheduler which uses minimum total power to transfer the information bits for all the end-to-end connections at the requested rates. To this end, we decompose the system into multiple isolated MIMO broadcast subsystems. In each time slot, each subsystem independently decides the transmit power, the antenna weights, the transmission rates and the forwarding rules of information bits based on the channel state information and previous decisions of other neighboring subsystems.

At the receiver, an MMSE equalizer is implemented to restore the orthogonality of the UMTS spreading codes and to perform the MIMO detection. The matrix inversion, necessary for the MMSE equalization, is implemented in an iterative manner, requiring only mult-add operations. Since the algorithm is division-free, it is numerically stable, robust, and very well suited for fixed-point implementation. We show that initial convergence of the iterative algorithm can be achieved in only a few iterations. Moreover, we study the equalizer performance in terms of coded block error ratio for low and high code rates and find the proposed algorithm very suitable for approximating matrix inverses.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.356599","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176528.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.356599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust MMSE Equalizer for MIMO Enhanced HSDPA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176528/","displayDocTitle":"A Robust MMSE Equalizer for MIMO Enhanced HSDPA","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10285195","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176528/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust MMSE Equalizer for MIMO Enhanced HSDPA","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039342S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4176530,"authors":[{"name":"E S Warner","affiliation":["QinetiQ Limited, Malvern, Worcestershire, UK"],"firstName":"E S","lastName":"Warner","id":"37294928500"},{"name":"I K Proudler","affiliation":["QinetiQ Limited, Malvern, Worcestershire, UK"],"firstName":"I K","lastName":"Proudler","id":"37283529500"},{"name":"M D Macleod","affiliation":["QinetiQ Limited, Malvern, Worcestershire, UK"],"firstName":"M D","lastName":"Macleod","id":"37279070600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176530","dbTime":"80 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"abstract":"Although it is usually assumed in the literature that interference to MEMO communication systems will be prevented by regulation, MEMO might in future be used in applications where strong interference could occur.

The performance measure of interest is the rate of decay of the expected mean squared error with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), called the distortion exponent. We first show that using a broadcast strategy as in [D. Gunduz and E. Erkip, 2006], but with a different power and rate allocation policy, the optimal distortion exponent can be achieved for bandwidth efficiencies, 0 les b < (|N - M| + 1)/min(M, N). This is the first time the optimal exponent for 1/min(M, N) < b < (|N - M| + l)/min(M, N) is characterized. We then propose a digital layered transmission scheme that uses both time layering and superposition. This includes many known schemes in [D. Gunduz and E. Erkip, 2006; G. Caire and K. Narayanan, 2005] as special cases. The proposed scheme is at least as good as the currently best known schemes for the entire range of bandwidth efficiencies, whereas at least for some M , N, and b, it is strictly better than the currently best known schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.356617","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176546.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.356617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Distortion Exponent of Some Layered Transmission Schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176546/","displayDocTitle":"On the Distortion Exponent of Some Layered Transmission Schemes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288358","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176546/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Distortion Exponent of Some Layered Transmission Schemes","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071077S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4176547,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Gastpar","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Foundations Center, Department of EECS, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Gastpar","id":"37273006200"},{"name":"Gerhard Kramer","affiliation":["Lucent Technologies, Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Kramer","id":"37275136700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176547","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference channels","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","Integrated circuit noise","AWGN","Degradation","Output feedback","Upper bound","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","cochannel interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noisy feedback","interference channels","Hekstra-Willems dependence-balance arguments"]}],"abstract":"An upper bound is established on the usefulness of noisy feedback for the interference channel (IC).

Each node is allowed to communicate with its immediate neighbor in order to exploit the spatial dimension, while it evolves locally to account for the time dimension as well. In applications where communication and energy resources are scarce, an approximate RLS scheme that is also fully distributed is proposed in order to decrease the communication burden necessary to implement distributed collaborative solution. The performance of the resulting algorithm tends to its exact counterpart in the mean-square sense as the forgetting factor lambda tends to unity. A spatial-temporal energy conservation argument is used to evaluate the steady-state performance of the individual nodes across the adaptive distributed network for the low communications RLS implementation. Computer simulations illustrate the results.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.356622","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176551.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.356622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Recursive Least-Squares Strategies Over Adaptive Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176551/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Recursive Least-Squares Strategies Over Adaptive Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288362","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176551/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Recursive Least-Squares Strategies Over Adaptive Networks","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-60.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040135S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4176566,"authors":[{"name":"Yimin Zhang","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Communications, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yimin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279958600"},{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Communications, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","id":"37280869400"},{"name":"Moeness G.

In the proposed system, a node can significantly increase the capacity of information it can handle. In addition, the proper use of multi-channel beamforming techniques eliminates the deafness problem, thereby secures high data rate channels for prioritized information transmission and dynamically optimize the resource allocation among different data streams.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Wireless mesh networks","Array signal processing","Mesh networks","Directive antennas","Directional antennas","Routing","Mobile ad hoc networks","Deafness","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","adaptive antenna arrays","directive antennas","mobile antennas","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel smart antenna","wireless ad hoc network","mobile ad hoc network","mesh network","network-centric operation","directional antenna technology","multichannel beamforming"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354756","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176566.pdf","startPage":"305","endPage":"309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Channel Smart Antennas in Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176566","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Channel Smart Antennas in Wireless Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176566/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176566/","accessionNumber":"10288373","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Channel Smart Antennas in Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065798S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4176568,"authors":[{"name":"Tomas Lang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Lang","id":"37284101800"},{"name":"Alberto Nannarelli","affiliation":["Department of Informatics & Mathematics Modelling, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Nannarelli","id":"37266650900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176568","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":363},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Throughput","Counting circuits","Computer science","Informatics","Hardware","Arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinational circuits","counting circuits","multiplying circuits","pipeline arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radix-10 combinational decimal multiplier","pipeline arithmetic","operand recoding","counter","partial product precomputation","adder"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we present a combinational decimal multiply unit which can be pipelined to reach the desired throughput.

It is a simple and elegant method, but it suffers from the problem of long latency. The angle recoding method is able to reduce the number of iterations by more than 50%, but its implementation in hardware requires a large increase in cycle time, to accommodate its complex angle selection function. This restricts its use to those cases where the angle of rotation is fixed and known in advance, so that the method can be applied off-line. This paper, presents a simpler implementation of the angle selection scheme that allows the angle recoding method to be used dynamically for any arbitrary angle of rotation. The method also has the advantage that all the angle constants are found in parallel, in a single step, without having to perform successive CORDIC iterations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Signal processing algorithms","Delay","Iterative algorithms","Equations","Hardware","Lattices","Filters","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","iterative methods","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive CORDIC","parallel angle recoding","CORDIC rotations","angle selection scheme","successive CORDIC iterations","coordinate rotation digital computer","iterative algorithm","signal processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176570","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354760","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176570.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354760","startPage":"323","endPage":"327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive CORDIC: Using Parallel Angle Recoding to Accelerate CORDIC Rotations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive CORDIC: Using Parallel Angle Recoding to Accelerate CORDIC Rotations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176570/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176570/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288376","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive CORDIC: Using Parallel Angle Recoding to Accelerate CORDIC Rotations","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-79.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053558S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4176577,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Caire","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Caire","id":"37267243200"},{"name":"Nihar Jindal","affiliation":["University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Nihar","lastName":"Jindal","id":"37268996400"},{"name":"Mari Kobayashi","affiliation":["Cenre Tecnologic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Mari","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37290906700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176577","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"abstract":"We consider a MIMO fading broadcast channel and compare the achievable ergodic rates when the channel state information at the transmitter is provided by \"analog\" noisy feedback or by quantized (digital) feedback.

Surprisingly it is always advantageous to increase the number of base station antennas, even when the reverse SINR is low and the channel estimate poor: greater numbers of antennas enable us to climb out of the noise and to serve more terminals. Even within short coherence intervals (T= 10 symbols) and with low SINR's (-10.0 dB reverse, 0.0 dB forward) given large numbers of base station antennas (M ges 16 ) it is both feasible and advantageous to learn the channel and to serve a multiplicity of terminals simultaneously as well.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354768","startPage":"359","endPage":"363","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176578.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How Much Training is Required for Multiuser Mimo?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176578/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"How Much Training is Required for Multiuser Mimo?","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","accessionNumber":"10288380","publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4176578/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How Much Training is Required for Multiuser Mimo?","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-87.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046775S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"294","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4176579,"authors":[{"name":"Marios Kountouris","affiliation":["France Telecom Research and Development Center, Issy-Les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Marios","lastName":"Kountouris","id":"37294325000"},{"name":"Ruben de Francisco","affiliation":["Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Ruben","lastName":"de Francisco","id":"37294312700"},{"name":"David Gesbert","affiliation":["Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gesbert","id":"37274459900"},{"name":"Dirk T.

Considering a multi-user system where each terminal employs multiple antennas (including the base station), asymptotic (in the number of antennas) analytical expressions of the system capacity are presented and studied in three different cases: equal time sharing, equal power sharing and optimum time-power scheduling. Interestingly, based only on the knowledge at the base station of the number of scatterers at each receiver link and not the full instantaneous channel realization (which can be fed back with limited overhead), one is able to derive optimal power and time scheduling policies which enhance the performance with respect to uniform time and power allocation. Simulations provided in the case of a small number of antennas confirm the asymptotic claims.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176582.pdf","startPage":"379","endPage":"383","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some Results on the Asymptotic Downlink Capacity of MIMO Multi-user Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","MIMO","Base stations","Time sharing computer systems","Scattering","Transmitters","Antennas and propagation","Power system modeling","Mobile communication","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","multi-access systems","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic downlink capacity","MIMO multiuser networks","scattering environment","multiple antennas","equal time sharing","equal power sharing","optimum time-power scheduling","channel realization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO multi-user","analytical capacity","capacity optimization","time-sharing","power allocation","time allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Some Results on the Asymptotic Downlink Capacity of MIMO Multi-user Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176582/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288384","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some Results on the Asymptotic Downlink Capacity of MIMO Multi-user Networks","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061074S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4176583,"authors":[{"name":"Kyeong Jin Kim","affiliation":["Nokia, Inc., Irving, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kyeong Jin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280262200"},{"name":"Charlie Zhang","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Dallas, USA","Motorola, Fort Worth, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Charlie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288988300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176583","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Base stations","Broadcasting","Vectors","Receiving antennas","Channel state information","Quality of service","Interference","Transmitting antennas","Multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO multiuser precoding system","multiple antenna multiuser channels","channel mismatch","perfect channel state information","linear prefilter","nonlinear vector perturbation"]}],"abstract":"For multiple antenna multiuser channels, the perfect channel state information (CSI) at the base station is assumed to achieve the sum rate advantage provided by the multiple antennas.

In this paper, we study one of the key components in this new construction, namely the multidimensional nonsubsampled hourglass filter banks. Starting with a rigorous analysis on the geometry of multidimensional hourglass-shaped passband supports, we propose a novel design for these filter banks in arbitrary dimensions, featuring perfect reconstruction and finite impulse response (FIR) filters. We analyze necessary and sufficient conditions for the resulting filters to achieve good frequency responses, and provide an optimal solution that satisfies these conditions using simplest filters. The proposed filter design technique is verified by a design example in 3-D.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Multidimensional systems","Passband","Finite impulse response filter","Frequency","Channel bank filters","Computational geometry","Information filtering","Information filters","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","channel bank filters","FIR filters","multidimensional digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multidimensional nonsubsampled hourglass filter banks","filter design","2D directional filter banks","finite impulse response filters","FIR filters"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354778","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176588.pdf","startPage":"406","endPage":"410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional Nonsubsampled Hourglass Filter Banks: Geometry of Passband Support and Filter Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176588","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional Nonsubsampled Hourglass Filter Banks: Geometry of Passband Support and Filter Design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176588/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176588/","accessionNumber":"10285206","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional Nonsubsampled Hourglass Filter Banks: Geometry of Passband Support and Filter Design","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-97.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045983S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176588","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4176597,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhua Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jinhua","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37291790800"},{"name":"Yan Xin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Xin","id":"37293344500"},{"name":"Hari Krishna Garg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hari Krishna","lastName":"Garg","id":"37281044200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176597","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference channels","Decoding","Silicon carbide","Integrated circuit modeling","Yttrium","Communication networks","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","channel coding","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference channels","random coding","cascaded superposition coding","common information"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176597","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354787","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176597.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Achievable Rate Region for Interference Channels with Common Information","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the interference channel with common information, of which the two senders need send not only the private information but also certain common information to their receivers.

Recently, an improved version has been proposed, where the inner loop is optimized only to a certain tolerance that still guarantees the algorithm convergence. This requires tracking the instantaneous error of the inner loop, and this issue has not yet been addressed. In this paper, we provide a tight upper bound of the instantaneous error of the inner loop which can be used to construct a non- heuristic stopping criterion. Specifically, we derive the Lagrange dual function of the inner optimization problem and provide a method to obtain a feasible dual variable from which a tight upper bound of the instantaneous error can be easily computed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Iterative algorithms","Upper bound","Optimization methods","Covariance matrix","Lagrangian functions","MIMO","Iterative methods","Convergence","Tracking loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel capacity","convergence of numerical methods","covariance matrices","iterative methods","matrix decomposition","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual decomposition","sum capacity maximization","vector broadcast channel","iterative water-filling like algorithm","covariance matrix","bisection method","algorithm convergence","instantaneous error tracking","nonheuristic stopping criterion","Lagrange dual function","inner optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vector broadcast channels","sum capacity","Lagrange duality","dual decomposition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354791","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176601.pdf","startPage":"468","endPage":"472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Dual Decomposition Based Sum Capacity Maximization for Vector Broadcast Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Dual Decomposition Based Sum Capacity Maximization for Vector Broadcast Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176601/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176601/","accessionNumber":"10288394","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Dual Decomposition Based Sum Capacity Maximization for Vector Broadcast Channels","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051062S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4176606,"authors":[{"name":"Agostino Capponi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, California Institute of Technology, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Agostino","lastName":"Capponi","id":"37272713300"},{"name":"Lance Kaplan","affiliation":["U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Lance","lastName":"Kaplan","id":"37271026000"},{"name":"Concetta Pilotto","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, California Institute of Technology, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Concetta","lastName":"Pilotto","id":"37299947900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176606","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor phenomena and characterization","Switches","Protocols","Energy management","Computer science","Upper bound","Signal processing","Batteries","Collaboration","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed sensors","mean square error methods","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random proximity sensor networks","binary proximity sensors","sensor management","birth-and-death stochastic process","mean-squared localization error","centroid localization scheme"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176606","abstract":"In this paper, we characterize the localization performance and connectivity of sensors networks consisting of binary proximity sensors using a random sensor management strategy.

A maximal asymptotic efficiency detector is employed as the first stage to generate better initial estimates of the user bits, followed by a local maximum likelihood kernel for subsequent stages. The proposed detector is particularly attractive for heavily correlated or over-loaded multi-user systems. The proposed multi-stage detector also includes the possibility of known memoryless non-linearity in the system, e.g., the non-linearity introduced due to saturation by the downlink RF amplifier in satellite communication systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354815","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176625.pdf","startPage":"585","endPage":"589","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-stage Detection Using Constellation Structure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Multi-stage Detection Using Constellation Structure","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4176625/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288409","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176625/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-stage Detection Using Constellation Structure","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042759S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4176637,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojie Zhang","affiliation":["Telecommunication R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Xiaojie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291977900"},{"name":"Jungwoo Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jungwoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280330400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176637","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Throughput","Receiving antennas","Scheduling algorithm","Downlink","Base stations","Upper bound","Channel capacity","Interference cancellation","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","computational complexity","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity multiuser MIMO scheduling","channel decomposition","inter-user interference","transmit preprocessing technique","base station","channel capacity"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Multiuser MIMO Scheduling with Channel Decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176637","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354827","startPage":"641","endPage":"645","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176637.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","abstract":"In multiuser MIMO systems, the base station schedules transmissions to a group of users simultaneously. In order to avoid the inter-user interference, a transmit preprocessing technique which decomposes the multiuser MIMO downlink channel into multiple parallel independent single-user MIMO channels can be used. When the number of users is larger than the maximum that the system can support simultaneously, the base station selects a subset of users who have the best instantaneous channel quality to maximize the system throughput. Since the exhaustive search for the optimal user set is computationally prohibitive, a low complexity scheduling algorithm which aims to maximize the capacity upper bound is proposed in this paper. Simulation results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm achieves similar total throughput as the optimal algorithm but with much lower complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176637/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176637/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288415","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Multiuser MIMO Scheduling with Channel Decomposition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Multiuser MIMO Scheduling with Channel Decomposition","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047128S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4176640,"authors":[{"name":"Ozgur Oyman","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Ozgur","lastName":"Oyman","id":"37296073400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176640","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Cellular networks","Spread spectrum communication","Frequency conversion","Routing","Context","Relays","Land mobile radio cellular systems","OFDM","Radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","cellular radio","communication complexity","diversity reception","frequency division multiple access","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","scheduling","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","multihop communication","relay-assisted broadband cellular network","information theory","orthogonal frequency division multihop multiple-access","interference-free multiuser communication","OFDMA","subcarrier allocation","multihop route selection","low-complexity centralized opportunistic scheduling algorithm","diversity gain"]}],"abstract":"We study the problem of joint scheduling and routing in the context of multi-hop communication over a relay-assisted broadband cellular network from an information-theoretic view.

The asymptotic performance of the LDPC codes that we designed are as close as 0.6 decibel from the theoretical limit.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4176653/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288426","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Systematic Construction of LDPC Codes for Relay Channel in Time-Division mode","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Systematic Construction of LDPC Codes for Relay Channel in Time-Division mode","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068596S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4176656,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Friedlander","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Friedlander","id":"37268592100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176656","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar antennas","Radar detection","Frequency","Transmitting antennas","Adaptive arrays","Clutter","Statistics","Detectors","Antenna arrays","Pulse amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","adaptive radar","radar antennas","radar clutter","radar detection","statistics","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive waveform design","multi antenna radar system","antenna array","clutter statistics","target detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176656","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354846","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","abstract":"We consider a radar system which uses an array of antennas, and is capable of adjusting the waveform transmitted through these antennas based on target and clutter statistics, on a pulse by pulse basis.

It is demonstrated that the asymptotic CRB of SP is 3dB lower than the MSE of the simplistic mean estimator. We propose a semi-blind SP scheme which asymptotically achieves this CRB. In the second part, we quantify the throughput performance of the estimation schemes by developing a framework for the worst case capacity of a channel with correlated symbols and noise. It is observed that while CP outperforms SP in terms of MSE of estimation, SP has an overall advantage over CP in terms of net throughput and is therefore bandwidth efficient.

The sum rate difference between the two strategies is analytically computed at asymptotically high SNR, and it is seen that this asymptotic statistic provides an accurate characterization at even moderate SNR levels.

Two design parameters, i.e., a channel quality threshold and a feedback probability, are proposed to adjust the scheduling and feedback behavior of this system.

The main advantages of the proposed protocol are that it substantially reduces the feedback requirements, still achieves multiuser diversity gain, and provides some fairness without a priori assumptions about the channel distribution.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354858","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176668.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","startPage":"794","endPage":"798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Feedback and Online Optimization for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Linear Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Feedback and Online Optimization for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Linear Receivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176668/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288435","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4176668/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Feedback and Online Optimization for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Linear Receivers","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08611S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4176669,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Vakili","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Vakili","id":"37294638900"},{"name":"Amir F.

Theoretically, with full and perfect CSI in hand, dirty paper coding (DPC) can achieve any point on the capacity region, including the non-symmetrical boundary points. However, the full CSI requirement and the computational complexity of DPC motivates the development of simpler schemes which require little feedback from the users and can obtain a large portion of the capacity of the channel. In this paper we will look at the throughput and rate ratio achieved by schemes based on the idea of opportunistic beam-forming and employing a rate back-off mechanism in order to maximize the throughput in the case of imperfect CSI. We will determine the optimal scheduling parameters and will show the order optimality of these schemes in the regime of large number of users.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354859","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176669.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","startPage":"799","endPage":"803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differentiated Rate Scheduling for MIMO Broadcast Channels with Estimation Errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Differentiated Rate Scheduling for MIMO Broadcast Channels with Estimation Errors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176669/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288436","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4176669/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differentiated Rate Scheduling for MIMO Broadcast Channels with Estimation Errors","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059829S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4176670,"authors":[{"name":"Sibasish Das","affiliation":["Department ECE, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Sibasish","lastName":"Das","id":"37291450400"},{"name":"Philip Schniter","affiliation":["Department ECE, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Schniter","id":"37271304700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176670","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Diversity reception","OFDM","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Interference","MIMO","Diversity methods","Channel state information","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming strategies","combining strategies","doubly selective channels","spatial diversity gains","MIMO-OFDM systems","inter-carrier interference","time-selective wireless channels","frequency-selective wireless channels","transmitter"]}],"abstract":"Beamforming and combining strategies are extensively used to harness spatial diversity gains in MIMO-OFDM systems.

The data rates and capacity demands of HSDPA require MIMO adaptive equalizers, which attempt to undo channel coloration and cross-coupling using the pilot signals defined in the 3GPP standard. However, the convergence of LMS-type algorithms is slow, thereby degrading dynamic performance. Surprisingly, the conventional RLS algorithm does not improve the convergence in this setting. However, we show that an RLS algorithm using an M-chip output correlator provides a dramatic improvement in convergence speed while still being implementable within affordable computational constraints.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354906","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176716.pdf","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive RLS MIMO Equalizer Algorithm for HSDPA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176716/","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive RLS MIMO Equalizer Algorithm for HSDPA","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288469","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176716/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive RLS MIMO Equalizer Algorithm for HSDPA","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053573S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4176745,"authors":[{"name":"Melissa Duarte","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Melissa","lastName":"Duarte","id":"37286100200"},{"name":"Ashutosh Sabharwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ashutosh","lastName":"Sabharwal","id":"37270204100"},{"name":"Chris Dick","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Dick","id":"37284012700"},{"name":"Raghu Rao","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Raghu","lastName":"Rao","id":"38560364000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176745","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Array signal processing","MIMO","Computer architecture","OFDM","Feedback","Antenna feeds","Quantization","Real time systems","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming architecture","MIMO systems","quantized feedback","multiple antenna systems","probability","quantization codebooks","real-time transmit beamforming","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","OFDM system"]}],"abstract":"Quantized feedback in multiple antenna systems has potential to increase throughput or reduce probability of outage.

Such scatterers arise from target components that contain edges, like flat plates, dihedral and trihedral reflectors, cones, cylinders and other basic geometric shapes. When the MLE of the linear prediction coefficients is used to estimate the scatterer's range, assuming constant amplitude, very closely spaced roots arise from the linear prediction polynomial. The mean square error (MSE) of the multiple root, corresponding to polynomial amplitude dependence, is computed in closed form in the presence of noise. A better approach is to constrain the linear prediction coefficients to account for the multiple roots while doing maximum likelihood estimation of these coefficients. Its mean square error performance is given by the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), is computed for the repeated root sinusoids and is shown to be significantly more accurate than the MSE of the distinct(non-repeated) roots model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Polynomials","Amplitude modulation","Radar scattering","Optical scattering","Frequency estimation","Chirp modulation","Amplitude estimation","Mean square error methods","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","backscatter","maximum likelihood estimation","mean square error methods","polynomial approximation","radar tracking","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation","MLE","radar return","complex scatterer superposition","target component","linear prediction coefficients","linear prediction polynomial","mean square error methods","MSE","Cramer-Rao bound","CRB","radar backscatter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354949","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176759.pdf","startPage":"1217","endPage":"1221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Range of Polynomial Amplitude Modulated Complex Scatterers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176759","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Range of Polynomial Amplitude Modulated Complex Scatterers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176759/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176759/","accessionNumber":"10285252","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Range of Polynomial Amplitude Modulated Complex Scatterers","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052289S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4176761,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The maximal SNR value obtainable via matched filtering is itself sensitive to the signal pulse shape initially given. In some signaling situations (e.g. radar) we are unilaterally free to choose signal shape, and with this come prospects of further SNR improvement. Four distinct perspectives on optimizing signal selection are pursued, including a new single-frequency toneburst windowing approach that becomes a very good approximation for large signal sizes. Three of the approaches are capable of near-optimal SNR performance, but the whitener eigenvalue method introduced is recommended as the best possible way of selecting signals. Discussion is included of special multi-tonality issues which arise for smaller signals and for multiple maximum whitener eigenvalues.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4176761/","accessionNumber":"10288498","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Signal Selection for FIR Matched Filtering in Pole-Only Noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Signal Selection for FIR Matched Filtering in Pole-Only Noise","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111118S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4176764,"authors":[{"name":"Shuying Shi","affiliation":["Fraunhofer German-Sino Laboratory for Mobile Communications (MCI), Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Shuying","lastName":"Shi","id":"37291460500"},{"name":"Martin Schubert","affiliation":["Fraunhofer German-Sino Laboratory for Mobile Communications (MCI), Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Schubert","id":"37265056000"},{"name":"Holger Boche","affiliation":["Heinrich-Hertz-Chair for Mobile Communications, Faculty of EECS, Technical University Berlin, Berlin, Germany","Heinrich-Hertz-Institut HHI, Fraunhofer Institute of Telecommunications, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Boche","id":"37276597900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176764","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational efficiency","Transceivers","MIMO","Downlink","Filters","Iterative algorithms","Design optimization","Mobile communication","Linear systems","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transceiver design","multiuser MIMO channel","power minimization","user-MMSE target","mean square error method","convergence behavior","power allocation","linear system","fixed point iteration"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies transceiver design for multiuser MIMO systems and focuses on the problem of minimizing the total transmit power while maintaining individual minimum mean square error (MMSE) requirement per user.

The field order q is chosen such that the number of bits per GF(q) LDPC symbol matches the number of bits per space-time symbol. The result is an elegant coding and decoding scheme that leverages the powerful LDPC iterative decoding technique. Results for 2, 3, and 4 transmitter systems with relatively short block lengths of around 2000 bits are provided, demonstrating frame-error- rate performances as close as 0.5 dB to the probability of outage upper bound.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354958","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176768.pdf","startPage":"1264","endPage":"1268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Space-Time GF(q) LDPC Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176768/","displayDocTitle":"Direct Space-Time GF(q) LDPC Modulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10285254","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176768/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Space-Time GF(q) LDPC Modulation","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049926S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4176771,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Rupp","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Rupp","id":"37276736700"},{"name":"Christoph F.

We are interested in the potential benefits/tradeoffs such systems have for the transmission of media. In doing so the paper necessarily considers two main issues. The first is to describe a measure/framework that can be used to generally guide the assessment of media (source) quality in the presence of outage events. The measure presented relates to traditional metrics but allows for more careful consideration of outage events. This allows for a more realistic assessment of the net media quality. Having such a measure is central to the MIMO investigation. The second issue is the optimization of media transport over wireless MIMO. With transmission systems one can explore with media (unlike data) the tradeoffs between media quality, the attempted transmission rate and the probability of outage events. With MIMO in particular we can consider adding diversity options enabled by layered source descriptions. The results suggest that MIMO transmission strategies that add diversity (linked to the source) can show benefits to media quality when compared to some media agnostic MIMO strategies that focus only on capacity.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354968","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176778.pdf","startPage":"1308","endPage":"1315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distortion Tradeoffs of Different Layered Speech and Media Transmission Techniques Over Wireless MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176778/","displayDocTitle":"Distortion Tradeoffs of Different Layered Speech and Media Transmission Techniques Over Wireless MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288510","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176778/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distortion Tradeoffs of Different Layered Speech and Media Transmission Techniques Over Wireless MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073539S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4176786,"authors":[{"name":"Rajeev Agrawal","affiliation":["Motorola, Inc., Arlington, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Rajeev","lastName":"Agrawal","id":"37286801200"},{"name":"Randall Berry","affiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Randall","lastName":"Berry","id":"37278715600"},{"name":"Jianwei Huang","affiliation":["Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293538200"},{"name":"Vijay Subramanian","affiliation":["Hamilton Institute, Maynooth, Ireland"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Subramanian","id":"37289003400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176786","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal scheduling","Resource management","OFDM","USA Councils","Downlink","Dynamic scheduling","Time division multiplexing","Multiaccess communication","Channel estimation","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","frequency division multiple access","radiocommunication","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal scheduling","OFDMA systems","resource allocation","wireless network","channel estimation","self-noise term","decoding process"]}],"abstract":"We consider a scheduling and resource allocation problem for the downlink of an OFDMA-based wireless network, where the channel estimation error is modeled by a self-noise term in the decoding process.

In component-wise conditionally unbiased (CWCU) Bayesian parameter estimation, every parameter in turn is treated as deterministic while the others are being treated as Bayesian. If the parameters are transmitted symbols, the CWCU approach corresponds to unbiased symbol detection whereas joint deterministic unbiasedness leads to a zero-forcing approach. In this paper we consider an intermediate approach corresponding to Block-CWCU (BCWCU) LMMSE estimation. We investigate the interplay between block-size, joint bias and prior covariance rank. We also investigate two sequential interference cancellation (SIC) implementations of BCWCU-LMMSE estimation. The results are illustrated with concrete examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4176802/","accessionNumber":"10288525","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Some Bias and MSE Issues in Block-Component-Wise Conditionally Unbiased LMMSE","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of Some Bias and MSE Issues in Block-Component-Wise Conditionally Unbiased LMMSE","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043499S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4176804,"authors":[{"name":"Jarvis Haupt","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Jarvis","lastName":"Haupt","id":"37294263500"},{"name":"Rui Castro","affiliation":["Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Castro","id":"37283436800"},{"name":"Robert Nowak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Nowak","id":"37265271600"},{"name":"Gerald Fudge","affiliation":["L-3 Communications, Integrated Systems, Greenville, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Fudge","id":"37294264800"},{"name":"Alex Yeh","affiliation":["L-3 Communications, Integrated Systems, Greenville, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37302282500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176804","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Pattern classification","Signal reconstruction","Testing","Compressed sensing","Image storage","Matched filters","Signal detection","Drives","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal classification","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sampling","signal classification","random vectors","signal reconstruction","error bounds","compressed sensing"]}],"abstract":"Compressive sampling (CS), also called compressed sensing, entails making observations of an unknown signal by projecting it onto random vectors. Recent theoretical results show that if the signal is sparse (or nearly sparse) in some basis, then with high probability such observations essentially encode the salient information in the signal. Further, the signal can be reconstructed from these \"random projections,\" even when the number of observations is far less than the ambient signal dimension. The provable success of CS for signal reconstruction motivates the study of its potential in other applications. This paper investigates the utility of CS projection observations for signal classification (more specifically, m-ary hypothesis testing).

Our goal is to preserve diversity and besides, to provide additional array gain (SNR gain) compared to conventional space-time codes. In practice, the transmitter channel state information is degraded by bandwidth limitation and noise in the feedback link. The imperfect and impaired feedback leads to drastic performance degradation unless the system is robustly designed against low-resolution and erroneous feedback information. Therefore, combining coding and beam- forming must be optimized for low-rate and erroneous feedback conditions. In this work, the combining is performed using a class of constellation sets inspired from orthogonal designs and precoded STBCs which is called partly precoded orthogonal designs (PPODs). PPODs provide full-diversity with any feedback rate, any number of transmit antennas, and any amount of feedback error. The attractive property of our scheme is that it converges to conventional space-time coding with low-rate and highly erroneous feedback and to pure beamforming with high rate and error-free feedback. Moreover, our scheme shows desirable robustness against design mismatch with respect to feedback channel specifications.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355008","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176818.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355008","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","startPage":"1501","endPage":"1505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-Time Coding and Beamforming Using Noisy Rate-Limited Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Space-Time Coding and Beamforming Using Noisy Rate-Limited Feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176818/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176818/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288537","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time Coding and Beamforming Using Noisy Rate-Limited Feedback","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-327.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061775S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4176819,"authors":[{"name":"Nihar Jindal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Nihar","lastName":"Jindal","id":"37268996400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176819","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Mobile antennas","Transmitting antennas","Antenna feeds","State feedback","Channel state information","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Downlink","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO broadcast channels","digital channel feedback","multiple antenna broadcast","downlink channel","limited rate digital feedback","convey channel state information","linear precoding"]}],"abstract":"This paper summarizes recent results on the multiple antenna broadcast (downlink) channel in which limited- rate digital feedback is used to convey channel state information from each mobile (receiver), each of which is assumed to have perfect channel information, to the transmitter.

In our previous work, the finite-rate feedback-based communication system was formulated as a general fixed-rate vector quantization problem for the purposes of analysis. In this paper, the analysis is extended to deal with complex variables further facilitating its use for communication systems with feedback. As an extended application of the general distortion analysis, tight lower bounds on the capacity loss of MIMO systems due to the finite-rate channel quantization are provided in this paper. Based on the obtained analytical results, it is shown that the system capacity loss decreases exponentially with the ratio of the quantization rate to the total degrees of freedom of the source variable. Interestingly, it is also shown that when the number of beams used by the transmit pre-coder equals to half of the transmit antennas (but not the minimal number of transmit and receive antennas), the system has the maximum number of free parameters to quantize. Finally, numerical and simulation results are presented which further confirm the tightness of theoretical distortion bounds.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176822.pdf","startPage":"1521","endPage":"1525","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of MIMO Systems with Finite-Rate Channel State Information Feedback: A Source Coding Perspective","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information analysis","MIMO","Channel state information","State feedback","Source coding","Communication systems","Receiving antennas","Fading","Vector quantization","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel coding","distortion","fading channels","feedback","MIMO communication","precoding","quantisation (signal)","source coding","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system","finite-rate channel state information feedback quantization","source coding","flat fading channel","distortion analysis","transmit antenna","complex variable"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of MIMO Systems with Finite-Rate Channel State Information Feedback: A Source Coding Perspective","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176822/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288541","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of MIMO Systems with Finite-Rate Channel State Information Feedback: A Source Coding Perspective","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071923S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4176823,"authors":[{"name":"Alkan Soysal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Alkan","lastName":"Soysal","id":"37294080100"},{"name":"Sennur Ulukus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sennur","lastName":"Ulukus","id":"37273214000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176823","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","MIMO","Transmitters","Iterative algorithms","Round robin","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Covariance matrix","Channel state information","State feedback","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","fading channels","feedback","iterative methods","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","multiuser channels","optimisation","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum multiuser power allocation","fading MIMO multiple access channels","CSI","channel state information","transmitters","single-user power allocation","covariance feedback","iterative algorithm","eigenvalues","covariance matrix","Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions","optimization problem","algorithm convergence","round-robin fashion"]}],"abstract":"We consider both the single-user and the multiuser power allocation problems in MIMO systems, where the receiver side has the perfect channel state information (CSI), and the transmitter side has partial CSI, which is in the form of covariance feedback. In a single-user MIMO system, we consider an iterative algorithm that solves for the eigenvalues of the optimum transmit covariance matrix that maximizes the rate. The algorithm is based on enforcing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions of the optimization problem at each iteration. We prove that this algorithm converges to the unique global optimum power allocation when initiated at an arbitrary point. We, then, consider the multi-user generalization of the problem, which is to find the eigenvalues of the optimum transmit covariance matrices of all users that maximize the sum rate of the MIMO multiple access channel (MIMO-MAC). For this problem, we propose an algorithm that finds the unique optimum power allocation policies of all users. At a given iteration, the multi-user algorithm updates the power allocation of one user, given the power allocations of the rest of the users, and iterates over all users in a round-robin fashion. Finally, we make several suggestions that significantly improve the convergence rate of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355013","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176823.pdf","startPage":"1526","endPage":"1530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Power Allocation in Fading MIMO Multiple Access Channels with Partial CSI at the Transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176823/","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Power Allocation in Fading MIMO Multiple Access Channels with Partial CSI at the Transmitters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288542","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176823/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Power Allocation in Fading MIMO Multiple Access Channels with Partial CSI at the Transmitters","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058856S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4176824,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Letessier","affiliation":["LEST-UMR CNRS, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Letessier","id":"37268163600"},{"name":"Baptiste Vrigneau","affiliation":["LEST-UMR CNRS, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Baptiste","lastName":"Vrigneau","id":"37294005300"},{"name":"Philippe Rostaing","affiliation":["LEST-UMR CNRS, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Rostaing","id":"37268164500"},{"name":"Gilles Burel","affiliation":["LEST-UMR CNRS, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Burel","id":"37268166900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176824","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitters","Covariance matrix","AWGN","Channel state information","Decoding","State feedback","Bit error rate","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","multiplexing","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["limited feedback unitary matrix","MIMO precoder","spatial multiplexing systems","transmission reliability","channel state information","optimum linear precoder","dmin precoder","finite codebook","quantized real-valued parameter","optimal precoding matrix","Alamouti code"]}],"abstract":"In spatial multiplexing systems, transmission reliability is enhanced by the full channel state information (CSI) used to design optimum linear precoders, but in practice a full CSI is often unrealistic.

SA imaging redefines the term beamformed line. Since the acquired information comes from all points in the region of interest it is possible to beamform the signals along a desired path, thus, improving the estimation of blood flow. The transmission of coded excitations makes it possible to achieve higher contrast and larger penetration depth compared to \"conventional\" scanners. This paper presents the development and implementation of the signal processing stages employed in SA imaging: compression of received data acquired using codes, and beamforming. The goal was to implement the system using commercially available field programmable gate arrays. The compression filter operates on frequency modulated pulses with duration of up to 50 mus sampled at 70 MHz. The beamformer can process data from 256 channels at a pulse repetition frequency of 5000 Hz and produces 192 lines of 1024 complex samples in real time. The lines are described by their origin, direction, length and distance between two samples in 3D. This parametric description makes it possible to quickly change the image geometry during scanning, thus enabling adaptive imaging and precise flow estimation.

MIMO radar, which can be viewed as a form of microwave tomography for medical imaging geometries, offers an alternative to current X-ray technology. Of particular interest is the detection of cancerous tumors in breast tissue. Previously, ultrawideband radar techniques have been considered. Here, an intermediate bandwidth is assumed, which enables the digitization of the entire baseband signal. However, this comes with the cost of self-interference because of transmitting and receiving simultaneously. Because the scattering response of tumors is weak compared to self-interference, mitigation of the direct transmitter-to-receiver signal is important to detection. In this application, three interference suppression techniques are considered: temporal mitigation, receive-array mitigation, and transmit-waveform optimization. Mitigation residuals, caused by calibration errors and signal nonlinearities, are included in the analysis. A system concept is introduced, and results from simulations using a simplified physical model are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Radar Medical Imaging: Self-Interference Mitigation for Breast Tumor Detection","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355020","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176830.pdf","startPage":"1558","endPage":"1562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Radar Medical Imaging: Self-Interference Mitigation for Breast Tumor Detection","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176830/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288546","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Radar Medical Imaging: Self-Interference Mitigation for Breast Tumor Detection","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065334S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4176838,"authors":[{"name":"Songnan Xi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Songnan","lastName":"Xi","id":"37298170000"},{"name":"Michael D.

In this paper, we investigated the crucial, yet not well discussed issue to jointly design beamforming weights for all transmitters, subject to total transmission power constraints, under the assumption that all users' channel state information (CSI) is available at each of the users. We proposed a class of orthogonal joint beamforming design schemes with matched filter receiver, and an eigen-beamforming (Eig-BF) scheme with ordered successive interference cancellation minimum mean square error receiver (OSIC-MMSE). By comparing these schemes with the optimal joint transceiver design with optimality in terms of overall mean square error (MSE), we show that Eig-BF OSIC-MMSE scheme achieves near-optimum performance at much lower complexity and with much simpler transmitter design, since it only requires each transmitter to know its own CSI and thus can be implemented in a decentralized way. This indicates that marginal performance improvement can be benefited from making all transmitters share their CSI. The orthogonal beamforming schemes, on the other hand, accomplish the simplest receiver structure at the cost of more complicated cooperative transmitters, and thus they may find applications in such systems as satellite communications or ad-hoc networks, where it is better to distribute computational loads among multiple transmitters than to impose it on a single receiver.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355028","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176838.pdf","startPage":"1593","endPage":"1600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Beamforming and Detection Design for Uplink Multiuser MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176838/","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Beamforming and Detection Design for Uplink Multiuser MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288550","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176838/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Beamforming and Detection Design for Uplink Multiuser MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065801S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4176839,"authors":[{"name":"Amir D.

As verified by simulations low computational effort has not necessarily led to a deterioration of performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Equalization of Frequency Selective MIMO Systems via Statistical and Trellis-based Methods","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355033","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176843.pdf","startPage":"1620","endPage":"1624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176843/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Blind Equalization of Frequency Selective MIMO Systems via Statistical and Trellis-based Methods","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176843/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288555","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Equalization of Frequency Selective MIMO Systems via Statistical and Trellis-based Methods","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066733S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4176845,"authors":[{"name":"Andre L.

In this paper, we address the problem of multipath parameter estimation for frequency-selective block-fading MIMO channels by means of parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis [1]-[2]. First, we present a fourth-order PARAFAC model for a specular MIMO radio channel, which jointly captures the space-time signature (angles of arrival, angles of departure and delays) and the time-varying fading amplitudes. Based on this model, an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm is used for estimating the multipath signals from a collection of received data blocks. After the multipath resolution stage, final estimates of the angles, delays and fading amplitudes are obtained by exploiting the knowledge of a multi-block training sequence. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the performance of this estimation approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Frequency-Selective Block-Fading MIMO Channels Using PARAFAC Modeling and Alternating Least Squares","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355035","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176845.pdf","startPage":"1630","endPage":"1634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Frequency-Selective Block-Fading MIMO Channels Using PARAFAC Modeling and Alternating Least Squares","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176845/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10285267","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Frequency-Selective Block-Fading MIMO Channels Using PARAFAC Modeling and Alternating Least Squares","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100334S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4176848,"authors":[{"name":"Huaning Niu","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Huaning","lastName":"Niu","id":"37279107600"},{"name":"Chiu Ngo","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chiu","lastName":"Ngo","id":"37287884600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176848","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":419},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Communication switching","Streaming media","Throughput","Wireless LAN","Delay","Switches","Channel state information","Algorithm design and analysis","Forward error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","forward error correction","MIMO communication","multiplexing","radio receivers","space-time codes","video streaming","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switching","802.11n MIMO systems","multimedia applications","wireless video streaming","WLAN communications","spatial multiplexing","diversity techniques","space-time coding","delay diversity","MIMO channel","instantaneous channel state information","post-detection constellation-coding","receiver","linear receiver","forward error correction codes","eigen-decomposition"]}],"abstract":"Tremendous interest in multimedia applications such as wireless video streaming drives the need for high throughput WLAN communications. Spatial multiplexing and diversity techniques (such as space-time coding and delay diversity) are adopted in the IEEE 802.11n draft specification to fully exploit the benefit of MIMO channel. In this paper, we propose an efficient and simple algorithm that switches between these modes based on the instantaneous channel state information. The post- detection constellation-coding SNR is calculated at the receiver for each mode and is used to derive the switching criterion. The algorithm is designed for practical 802.11n systems with linear receiver and outer forward error correction codes, and does not require complicated eigen-decomposition.

In this paper, we propose the quantization error correction algorithm to enhance the performance and perform simulations to verify our results.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355042","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176852.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","startPage":"1662","endPage":"1665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lattice Reduction Aided MIMO Detectors with Quantization Error Correction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Lattice Reduction Aided MIMO Detectors with Quantization Error Correction","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176852/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288562","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4176852/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice Reduction Aided MIMO Detectors with Quantization Error Correction","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036784S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4176853,"authors":[{"name":"Elisabeth de Carvalho","affiliation":["University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Elisabeth","lastName":"de Carvalho","id":"37293743600"},{"name":"Petar Popovski","affiliation":["University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Petar","lastName":"Popovski","id":"37281987200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176853","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic repeat request","MIMO","Decoding","Transmitting antennas","Samarium","Packet switching","Transmitters","Equalizers","Block codes","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","block codes","equalisers","MIMO communication","multiplexing","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ARQ strategies","packet retransmission strategies","MIMO spatial multiplexing systems","independent coding","zero forcing linear equalizer","space time block code structure","channel state information","retransmission antennas"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents packet retransmission strategies for MIMO spatial multiplexing (SM) systems with independent coding and independent ARQ processes per stream.

In this paper, we investigate an OFDM UWB receiver based on single and double differential modulation/demodulation schemes. Since differential detection eliminates the need for channel estimation, it is a highly attractive option where simplicity and robustness of implementation are desired. However, differential detection suffers from a performance gap when compared to coherent detection with perfect channel knowledge at the receiver. We show that this gap is quite small when channel estimation is taken into consideration for the coherent system. Moreover, in the presence of frequency offset, a double- differential system can outperform a coherent system. We also investigate a differential space-time block-coded system based on the Alamouti scheme, and analyze its performance for the UWB environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Performance Double Differential OFDM UWB Receiver","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355058","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176868.pdf","startPage":"1733","endPage":"1737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"A High-Performance Double Differential OFDM UWB Receiver","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176868/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288575","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Performance Double Differential OFDM UWB Receiver","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044978S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4176869,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279498800"},{"name":"Bin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37291894300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176869","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Downlink","Transmitters","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","Channel capacity","Physical layer","Digital video broadcasting","OFDM","Radio broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcasting","cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA-based broadcasting","access hybrid network","point-to-point connectivity","cellular infrastructure","network capacity","cooperative transmission"]}],"abstract":"Communication networks can be conveniently categorized into two types: those that provide point-to-point connectivity (e.g., cellular) and others that are 'broadcast' in nature (such as TV and radio) that are inherently 'point-to- multipoint'.

However, wide area transmission in cellular environments requires adequate performance in the presence of co-channel interference. Although methods for handling this problem have been proposed before, they usually require bandwidth expansion (e.g. for frequency reuse factors larger than 1) or interference sensing at the receiver (which is not resilient to fast fading). In this paper, single-sideband OFDM is proposed to provide a simple method for co-channel interference resiliency in cellular environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176874.pdf","startPage":"1762","endPage":"1766","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Sideband OFDM for Cellular Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Interchannel interference","Bandwidth","Throughput","Time division multiple access","Multiaccess communication","Transmitters","Frequency diversity","Base stations","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cochannel interference","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-sideband OFDM","cellular system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wireless transmission","frequency-selective channel","wide area transmission","co-channel interference","bandwidth expansion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Single-Sideband OFDM for Cellular Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176874/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288581","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Sideband OFDM for Cellular Systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044815S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4176875,"authors":[{"name":"Tomasz Hrycak","affiliation":["Numerical Harmonic Analysis Group (NuHAG), Department of Mathematics, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Hrycak","id":"37294456600"},{"name":"Gerald Matz","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Matz","id":"37284513500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176875","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":283},"abstract":"We consider wireless OFDM communications over rapidly varying channels as occurring e.g. in high-mobility scenarios.

In this paper, we propose novel equalizers to combat ICI and enable reliable communications even at high Doppler frequencies. In contrast to existing frequency-domain approaches, our schemes operate in the time domain. This allows a low-complexity implementation without introducing any systematic channel approximation errors. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that in conjunction with channel coding our methods achieve significant Doppler diversity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176875.pdf","startPage":"1767","endPage":"1771","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Time-Domain ICI Equalization for OFDM Communications Over Rapidly Varying Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","OFDM","Equalizers","Interference","Digital video broadcasting","Frequency domain analysis","Bit error rate","Convolutional codes","Convolution","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","equalisers","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","radiocommunication","telecommunication network reliability","time-domain analysis","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless OFDM communication","rapidly varying channel","intercarrier interference","low-complexity time-domain ICI equalization","reliable communication","Doppler frequency","frequency-domain approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Time-Domain ICI Equalization for OFDM Communications Over Rapidly Varying Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176875/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288582","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Time-Domain ICI Equalization for OFDM Communications Over Rapidly Varying Channels","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-384.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042214S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4176876,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Ketseoglou","affiliation":["Pomona ECE Department, California Polytechnic State University, Pomona, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Ketseoglou","id":"37300531400"},{"name":"Andrew Tom","affiliation":["Pomona ECE Department, California Polytechnic State University, Pomona, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Tom","id":"37294035800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176876","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receiving antennas","Bit error rate","Detectors","Fading","Least squares approximation","Error analysis","Bandwidth","Iterative decoding","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","diversity reception","expectation-maximisation algorithm","fading channels","iterative decoding","maximum likelihood decoding","maximum likelihood detection","multipath channels","multiuser detection","OFDM modulation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative MAP multiuser OFDM detector","expectation maximization","aposteriori probability channel decoder","turbo processor","multipath fading frequency-selective channel estimation","spatial diversity","channel side information receiver","normalized Doppler frequency"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce an Expectation Maximization (EM) based iterative multi-user OFDM detector, the detector works in tandem with an a posteriori probability (APP) channel decoder to form a Turbo processor, suitable for use in a rapidly changing multi- path fading environment.

The normalized Doppler frequencies are in the order of 0.02 to 0.04, i.e. fast changing channel conditions. The system uses a single pilot slot every 10 - 15 slots, for initial channel estimation (acquisition) per user, so only minimal overhead is required. We show that this configuration achieves very high gains first by virtue of the EM detector that simultaneously detects user data and tracks the channel changes, and second by employing the APP decoder, while at the same time it converges very closely to the ideal, perfect channel side information receiver.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355066","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176876.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","startPage":"1772","endPage":"1776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative MAP Multi-User OFDM over Rapidly-Varying Frequency-Selective Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative MAP Multi-User OFDM over Rapidly-Varying Frequency-Selective Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176876/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288583","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4176876/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative MAP Multi-User OFDM over Rapidly-Varying Frequency-Selective Channels","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030108S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4176877,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Fertl","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Fertl","id":"37294258000"},{"name":"Gerald Matz","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Matz","id":"37284513500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176877","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Sampling methods","Wireless LAN","Time-varying channels","Training data","Iterative algorithms","Computational complexity","Frequency estimation","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","conjugate gradient methods","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","WiMax","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM packet transmissions","channel estimation","mobile environments","2D irregular sampling","training data arrangement","iterative conjugate gradient methods","block Toeplitz matrix","WiMAX","wireless LAN"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel pilot-aided channel estimation method for OFDM packet transmissions over time-varying channels.

For the generalization, a new system parameter called repetition index is introduced whose value is unity for previously reported special cases. By choosing a repetition index larger than unity, the number of received blocks needed for blind identification is significantly reduced compared to all previously reported methods. This feature makes it more realistic especially in wireless environments where the channel state is usually fast-varying. Given the number of received blocks available, the minimum value of repetition index is derived. Theoretical limit allows the proposed method to perform blind identification using only three received blocks. Simulation results not only demonstrate the capability of the algorithm to perform blind identification using fewer received blocks, but also show that in some cases system performance can be improved by choosing a repetition index larger than needed. If the number of received blocks and the repetition index are optimally chosen, the proposed method outperforms previously reported special cases, especially in time-varying channel environments.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176881.pdf","endPage":"1800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Subspace-based Algorithms For Blind Channel Estimation In Cyclic Prefix Systems","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355071","startPage":"1796","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Subspace-based Algorithms For Blind Channel Estimation In Cyclic Prefix Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176881/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","accessionNumber":"10288586","publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4176881/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Subspace-based Algorithms For Blind Channel Estimation In Cyclic Prefix Systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05115S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4176882,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Larsen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Larsen","id":"38559695600"},{"name":"A.

First, a decoding metric based on the channel a posteriori probability density, conditioned on the channel estimate is derived and used for decoding BICM multiband OFDM. Then, we characterize the limits of reliable information rates in terms of the maximal achievable outage rates associated to the proposed metric. We also compare our results with the outage rates of a system using a theoretical decoder. Our results are useful for designing a communication system where a prescribed quality of service (QoS), in terms of achievable target rates with small error probability, must be satisfied even in the presence of imperfect channel estimation. Numerical results over both realistic UWB and theoretical Rayleigh fading channels show that the proposed method provides significant gain in terms of BER and outage rates compared to the classical mismatched detector, without introducing any additional complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable Outage Rates with Improved Decoding of BICM Multiband OFDM under Channel Estimation Errors","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355073","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176883.pdf","startPage":"1806","endPage":"1810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Achievable Outage Rates with Improved Decoding of BICM Multiband OFDM under Channel Estimation Errors","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176883/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288588","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable Outage Rates with Improved Decoding of BICM Multiband OFDM under Channel Estimation Errors","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046367S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4176884,"authors":[{"name":"Prasad Yaddanapudi","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Prasad","lastName":"Yaddanapudi","id":"37294468600"},{"name":"Dimitrie C.

Here SM is applied to OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) transmission. In SM the transmit antenna number is used as an explicit source of information. SM maps a block of information bits to an information symbol and to a particular transmit antenna such that the same information symbol transmitted from different antennas conveys different information. At each time instant, only the corresponding transmit antenna will be radiating signal power on a particular OFDM sub-carrier, while all other transmit antennas transmit zero power. Consequently, inter-channel interference (ICI) at the receiver input and the need for antenna synchronization are completely avoided.

Building upon an existing multichannel digital receiver, we present an innovative single-FPGA front-end that performs real-time 2D-FFT reconstruction from arrays of up to 16 coils. Partial reconfiguration enables rapid switching of FPGA modules for maximal flexibility and lower hardware cost. After an acquisition has been buffered, more complicated parallel MRI reconstruction techniques can replace receiver logic. Alternatively, the front- end can be used as a hardware-accelerated reconstruction engine with other receivers or for PCs.

The first approach combines homodyne detection with SENSE-like reconstructions. The second approach employs separate regularization of the real and imaginary components (two-parameters) of the parallel MRI linear system to constrain the magnitude of phase variation in the reconstructed image. We show that both methods robustly reconstruct images from several sampling patterns. The dominant difference is the number of symmetric lines of k-space needed to provide high quality reconstructions. The two parameter approach can reconstruct good images using only two whereas the homodyne approach requires significantly more. We present a method for automatic selection of the two parameters, and results from both high resolution and low contrast phantom data.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355088","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176898.pdf","startPage":"1880","endPage":"1884","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study of Parallel MRI Reconstruction Approaches for Sub-Sampled Partial-Fourier Acquisitions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Study of Parallel MRI Reconstruction Approaches for Sub-Sampled Partial-Fourier Acquisitions","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4176898/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10285278","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176898/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Parallel MRI Reconstruction Approaches for Sub-Sampled Partial-Fourier Acquisitions","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051289S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4176907,"authors":[{"name":"Dung T.

It is well known that optimal scheduling solutions require centralized information and lead to impractical implementations due to their enormous complexity (high-degree polynomial or NP-hard, depending on the interference scenario). Further, an important characteristic in many multi-hop scenarios is the need for distributed algorithms that operate on local information. Thus, in this paper we develop a constant-time random access distributed algorithm for scheduling in multi- hop wireless networks. An important feature of this scheme is that it achieves a 2-approximation efficiency ratio and can be implemented in an entirely distributed manner with low overhead.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176911.pdf","startPage":"1937","endPage":"1941","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355101","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355101","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176911","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Wireless networks","Optimal scheduling","Processor scheduling","Computer networks","Distributed algorithms","Interference","Scheduling algorithm","Application software","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","distributed algorithms","radio networks","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random access scheduling","multihop wireless networks","scheduling scheme performance","optimal scheduling","high-degree polynomial problem","NP-hard problem","constant-time random access distributed algorithm","2-approximation efficiency ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176911/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Random Access Scheduling Schemes in Multi-hop Wireless Networks","accessionNumber":"10288603","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4176911/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Random Access Scheduling Schemes in Multi-hop Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049463S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4176912,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangping Qin","affiliation":["Samsung Information Systems America, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiangping","lastName":"Qin","id":"37266932700"},{"name":"Randall Berry","affiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Randall","lastName":"Berry","id":"37278715600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176912","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Wireless networks","Rayleigh channels","Frequency conversion","Power system modeling","OFDM","Throughput","Fading","Centralized control","Information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","fading channels","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","radio networks","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed resource allocation","scheduling","OFDMA wireless network","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","time-slotted model","subchannel assignment","channel gain","collision model","suboptimal policy","fading distribution","wireless access network"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we develop distributed resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for the uplink of an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) wireless network.

For the detection of binary symbols transmitted over a general MIMO channel, the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) detector is a computationally attractive alternative to exact ML detection. In the SDR detector, the hard combinatorial optimization problem arising in the ML detector is relaxed into a simple convex optimization problem followed by component wise threshold decisions. In this work, we argue that the SDR detector will provide an increase in diversity over simpler decoder structures such as the ZF and MMSE detectors.

To combat the severe time dispersiveness of the channel OFDM is incorporated. Use of OFDM simplifies the challenging problem of equalization in a MIMO system, due to both inter-symbol- interference (ISI) and co-antenna interference (CAI). The iterative algorithms work in two stages. The first stage estimates the transmitted symbols using a low complexity MMSE equalizer, which accounts for the variance of the already estimated symbols. Then, the second stage finds the a posteriori probabilities of the estimated symbols to find their means and variances to use in the MMSE equalizer in the following iteration. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed iterative algorithm is better than the MMSE equalizer and close to the matched filter bound (MFB) at low computational cost.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Iterative Equalization for Severe Time Dispersive MIMO Channels","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355138","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176948.pdf","startPage":"2102","endPage":"2106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Iterative Equalization for Severe Time Dispersive MIMO Channels","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176948/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288625","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Iterative Equalization for Severe Time Dispersive MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056294S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4176949,"authors":[{"name":"Kyeong Jin Kim","affiliation":["Nokia, Inc., Irving, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kyeong Jin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280262200"},{"name":"Tejas Bhatt","affiliation":["Nokia, Inc., Irving, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Tejas","lastName":"Bhatt","id":"37294653700"},{"name":"Ronald A.

Instead of the approach based on the Frobenius square norm behaviour (FSNB) previously proposed in [1]-[3], we develop a new blind method based on the maximum eigenvalue behaviour (MEVB) according to analysis window shifts. Theoretical analysis shows that the MEVB-based criterion provides a significant improvement of performances, and proves that it is a powerful tool for blind synchronization. We show that the improvement is mainly due to suppression of synchronisation peaks masking that occurred with the previous method.

However, normal SDA suffers from variable computation complexity and non-fixed throughput. The K-best SDA is proposed for MIMO detections for its less complexity and fixed throughput. Most of the K-best SDA complexity comes from the path cost computation and sorting operations at each layer. In this paper, we first introduce a reduced complexity K-best SDA, based on Schnorr-Euchner (SE) strategy. Simulations show that for 4 x 4 64QAM system, we can save 25% path cost computation and 27% sorting operations with almost no performance loss. In addition, by exploiting the natural partial sorted results coming from the SE method, we develop an architecture applying a modified rank order filter to the sorting operation for the K-Best SDA. Compared with bubble sort algorithms, our architecture can reduce almost 50% sorting complexity, which is a significant contribution to the K-best SDA implementation for MIMO systems.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355157","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176967.pdf","startPage":"2190","endPage":"2194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved K-Best Sphere Decoding Architecture for MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"An Improved K-Best Sphere Decoding Architecture for MIMO Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176967/","publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","accessionNumber":"10285292","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176967/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved K-Best Sphere Decoding Architecture for MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050243S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4176968,"authors":[{"name":"Nisha Champaneria","affiliation":["Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Nisha","lastName":"Champaneria","id":"37294592500"},{"name":"Todd K.

In order to combine the sphere decoder with the outer channel code decoder, researchers have proposed to include a candidate list in the sphere decoder to provide soft information to the channel code decoder. This algorithm is called list sphere decoder (LSD). With the LSD, due to the introduction of the candidate list, the decoding speed is around 10 times lower than that of the conventional sphere decoder (SD) if the LSD uses the largest Euclidean distance (ED) in the list for the radius reduction. At the same time, if the candidate list is divided into multiple sublists to reduce the complexity of the list updating circuit, the average number of cycles required becomes even larger. Meanwhile, in real applications, the maximal number of cycles in the sphere decoder is usually bounded to guarantee a certain data throughput. This bound will also affect the performance of the LSD. In this paper, we propose a radius reduction method which uses either the mean value or the median value of the Euclidean distances (ED) of the candidates in the list. This algorithm leads to a faster decoding speed with little or no performance loss. If the idea of using sublists is applied, this radius reduction method reduces the amount of increase in the average number of cycles. Furthermore, if a bound is set on the maximal number of cycles, this method can provide better performance than the original LSD. We also propose a simple performance evaluation method for comparing different radius reduction methods without involving a real soft-input-soft-output channel code decoder.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355159","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176969.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355159","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","startPage":"2200","endPage":"2203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Radius Reduction Method for List Sphere Decoders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Radius Reduction Method for List Sphere Decoders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176969/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176969/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288639","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Radius Reduction Method for List Sphere Decoders","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-478.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058113S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4176970,"authors":[{"name":"Milos Ivkovic","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Milos","lastName":"Ivkovic","id":"38242245800"},{"name":"Shuguang Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Shuguang","lastName":"Cui","id":"37267838900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176970","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Parity check codes","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","Iterative algorithms","AWGN channels","Iterative decoding","Equations","Message passing","Sum product algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error correction codes","impulse noise","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hard decision error correcting scheme","LDPC code","impulse noise channel","low-density parity-check code","binary erasure channel","binary symmetric channel","decoding algorithm","three-state quantization","sum-product algorithm"]}],"abstract":"We investigate hard decision based low- density parity-check (LDPC) codes over an impulse noise channel, which is modeled as the concatenation of a binary erasure channel (BEC) and a binary symmetric channel (BSC).

Popularity of these codes is more from the ease of generation from standard kernels rather than the efficiency of the codes. Availability of these codes is limited in number and in their lengths. By relaxing the restrictions like zero crossings, linear phase etc on the nature of codes, number of new sets of codes can be generated. In this paper, methodology has been proposed for generating new Walsh-like family codes that can be used for both synchronous and asynchronous communications. Performance characteristics of these codes have been studied in AWGN and in Rayleigh fading channels. These codes outperform Walsh codes in their asynchronous channel behavior and closely match with Gold codes performance. In addition, we present in this paper that there are a good number of such desirable code sets available in the binary sample space with different transform sizes. These new binary sets with good performance and flexible code lengths might help us to improve the spread spectrum capabilities of future CDMA communications systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Walsh-like Nonlinear Phase Orthogonal Transforms for CDMA Communications","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355162","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176972.pdf","startPage":"2214","endPage":"2218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Walsh-like Nonlinear Phase Orthogonal Transforms for CDMA Communications","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176972/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288641","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Walsh-like Nonlinear Phase Orthogonal Transforms for CDMA Communications","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094212S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4176973,"authors":[{"name":"Don Torrieri","affiliation":["Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Don","lastName":"Torrieri","id":"37300038300"},{"name":"Avinash Mathur","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wichita State University, Wichita, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Avinash","lastName":"Mathur","id":"37287269800"},{"name":"Amitav Mukherjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wichita State University, Wichita, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Amitav","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37291343600"},{"name":"Hyuck M.

At the receiver, an initial estimate of channel coefficient and noise PSD is obtained using pilot information. Subsequent values of channel coefficient and noise PSD are both iteratively updated by the soft feedback from the LDPC decoder. The updated channel coefficient and noise PSD are iteratively passed to the LDPC decoder, which results in an improved decoding accuracy, as shown.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176973.pdf","startPage":"2219","endPage":"2223","publicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative EM Estimation Based LDPC CDMA Receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Multiaccess communication","Iterative decoding","Turbo codes","Phase shift keying","Signal to noise ratio","Modulation coding","Channel estimation","Demodulation","Phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","code division multiple access","expectation-maximisation algorithm","iterative decoding","parity check codes","phase shift keying","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative EM estimation","CDMA receiver","channel coefficient","power spectral density","iterative receiver","low-density parity-check code","LDPC code","channel estimation","expectation maximization","binary phase-shift keying","pilot information","LDPC decoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EM Algorithm","Iterative receiver","LDPC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Iterative EM Estimation Based LDPC CDMA Receiver","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4176973/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288642","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative EM Estimation Based LDPC CDMA Receiver","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079911S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4176975,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Yang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, MC 136-93, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chun-Yang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293085800"},{"name":"P.

Such mismatches can occur as a result of direction-of arrival (DOA) errors, local scattering, near-far spatial signature mismatch, waveform distortion, source spreading, imperfectly calibrated arrays and distorted antenna shape. In this paper, an adaptive beamformer which is robust against the DOA mismatch is proposed. This method imposes two quadratic constraints such that the magnitude responses of two steering vectors exceed unity. Then a diagonal loading method is used to force the magnitude responses within a range of the arrival angles to exceed unity. The diagonal loading factor can be computed systematically by a proposed algorithm. Numerical examples show that this method has a significantly better SINR performance compared to previously published methods (including the MVDR), and a complexity comparable to the standard MVDR beamformer.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176491","startPage":"2227","endPage":"2231","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176490/4176491/04176975.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Beamformer Robust to Steering Vector Mismatch","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4176975/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Beamformer Robust to Steering Vector Mismatch","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288643","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Beamformer Robust to Steering Vector Mismatch","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066381S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4176976,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksandar Dogandzic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Aleksandar","lastName":"Dogandzic","id":"37317008800"},{"name":"Benhong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Benhong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38200348700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0784-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0785-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"4176976","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Amplitude estimation","Adaptive signal detection","Interference","Bayesian methods","Analysis of variance","White noise","Noise level","Signal detection","Detectors","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","amplitude estimation","Bayes methods","interference (signal)","matched filters","signal detection","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex signal amplitude estimation","adaptive signal detection","unknown low-rank interference","Bayesian method","generalized multivariate analysis of variance","GMANOVA","white noise","iterated conditional modes algorithm","ICM algorithm","adaptive-matched-fllter","signal detector"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4176976","abstract":"We propose a Bayesian method for complex signal amplitude estimation in low-rank interference.

However, in practice the precise value of the SOI steering vector is unknown and only an estimate is used. In hopes of protecting the actual SOI in case of mismatches it has been recently proposed to use a non-attenuation constraint inside a hypersphere centered at the presumed SOI steering vector. In an effort to strike a balance between robustness to steering vector error and interference-plus-noise suppression, we propose in this paper to use two concentric hyperspheres instead of one with different degrees of protection in each. We determine conditions on the user defined parameters to ensure existence of a solution to the resulting constrained optimization problem. The multiply constrained filter solution is demonstrated to be of the diagonally loaded type with adaptive loading factor. We further give necessary conditions for the two-constraint filter to be distinct, in terms of SINR, to the one-constraint case.

It can be applied prior to delay lock loops in Global Positioning System (GPS). The optimum cancellation weights can be selected based on the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) criterion. However, when the interferer is close to one of the satellites, the MVDR fails to lower the interference-to-signal-and-noise ratio and also leads to irregular and undesirable array response. The solution is to use one set of weights for each satellite, and, as such, isolate this failure to one satellite, rather spread it to all satellites in the field of view. The paper compares single vs. multiple beam MVDR GPS receivers under different interference location and polarization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4176990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","accessionNumber":"10288653","htmlLink":"/document/4176990/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"GPS Interference Cancellation Performance in Single and Multiple MVDR Beamforming Methods","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPS Interference Cancellation Performance in Single and Multiple MVDR Beamforming Methods","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACSSC-00-499.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055541S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176490","isNumber":"4176491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176490","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4176491","articleId":"4176990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4177031,"authors":[{"name":"Yongling Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Yongling","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37293341500"},{"name":"Umit Ozguner","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Umit","lastName":"Ozguner","id":"37272118000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0171-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4177031","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4177031","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Remotely operated vehicles","Mobile robots","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Switches","Multiagent systems","Control system synthesis","Rail transportation","Land vehicles","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-agent systems","position control","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path routing","switch-back avoidance","autonomous vehicles","multiagent system modelling","multiagent system control","cellular structure","unmanned aerial vehicles","unmanned ground vehicles","virtual switch","recursive algorithm"]}],"abstract":"We proposed a new framework for multi-agent system modelling and control with a cellular structure in (Zheng and Ozguner, 2006), and this is a subsequent paper as a series, focusing on the path routing for the leading vehicle of each vehicle group.

Such structure is adopted to allow the implementation of the proposed controllers in the current framework, without changing the structure of the controllers already implemented. Besides guaranteeing a minimum performance index for the closed loop system, the proposed procedure also guarantees the controller robustness at the design stage.

Using past traffic traces we characterize network traffic during various time-of-day intervals, assuming that it is anomaly-free. We present two different approaches to characterize traffic: (i) a model-free approach based on the method of types and Sanov's theorem, and (ii) a model-based approach modeling traffic using a Markov modulated process. Using these characterizations as a reference we continuously monitor traffic and employ large deviations results to compute the probability that the monitored traffic is \"consistent\" with the corresponding reference characterization. Low values of this probability identify, in real-time, traffic anomalies.

Unlike traditional robots, continuum robot manipulators do not have rigid joints, hence the manipulators are compliant, extremely dexterous, and capable of dynamic, adaptive manipulation in unstructured environments; however, the development of high-performance control algorithms for these manipulators is a challenging problem. In this paper, we present an approach to whole arm grasping control for continuum robots. The grasping controller is developed in two stages; high level path planning for the grasping objective, and a low level joint controller using a neural network feedforward component to compensate for dynamic uncertainties. These techniques are used to enable whole arm grasping without using contact force measurements and without using a dynamic model of the continuum robot","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2006.377452","startPage":"6445","endPage":"6449","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 45th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2006.377452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176993","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 45th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176992/4176993/04177464.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Grasping Controller for Continuum Robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4177464/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Grasping Controller for Continuum Robots","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4177464/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9408897","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Grasping Controller for Continuum Robots","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"CDC-00-471.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060976S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176992","isNumber":"4176993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176992","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4176993","articleId":"4177464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4177510,"authors":[{"name":"Prabir Barooah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Center for Control, Dynamical-Systems, and Computation, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Prabir","lastName":"Barooah","id":"37299740200"},{"name":"Joao P.

Effective resistances are defined to be the square blocks that appear in the diagonal of the inverse of the matrix-weighted Dirichlet graph Laplacian matrix. However, they can also be obtained from a \"generalized\" electrical network that is constructed from the graph, and for which currents, voltages and resistances take matrix values. Effective resistances play an important role in several problems related to distributed control and estimation. They appear in least-squares estimation problems in which one attempts to reconstruct global information from relative noisy measurements; as well as in motion control problems in which agents attempt to control their positions towards a desired formation, based on noisy local measurements. We show that in either of these problems, the effective resistances have a direct physical interpretation. We also show that effective resistances provide bounds on the spectrum of the graph Laplacian matrix and the Dirichlet graph Laplacian.

In this paper, a force-position teleoperation controller is implemented in which the master damping is adjusted in a dual manner based on the online estimate of operator's arm damping. To this purpose, a novel methodology for online estimation of forearm damping when arm movement is restricted to only elbow joint motion in horizontal plane is developed. The proposed scheme uses elbow joint angular position and velocity, and electromyogram signals collected from upper arm muscles in a radial basis function artificial neural network for online estimation of damping parameter.

An equally important design objective, as a result of each node's finite power, is for measurement processing to satisfy explicit constraints on, or perhaps make selective use of, the distributed algorithmic resources. We formulate this dual-objective design problem within the Bayesian decentralized detection paradigm, modeling resource constraints by a directed acyclic network with low-rate, unreliable communication links. Existing team theory establishes when necessary optimality conditions reduce to a convergent iterative algorithm to be executed offline (i.e., before measurements are processed). Even so, this offline algorithm has exponential complexity in the number of nodes and its distributed implementation assumes a fully-connected communication network. We state conditions by which the offline algorithm admits an efficient message-passing interpretation, featuring linear complexity in the number of nodes and a natural distributed implementation. We experiment with a simulated network of binary detectors, applying the message-passing algorithm to optimize the achievable tradeoff between global detection performance and network-wide online communication. The empirical analysis also exposes a design tradeoff between constraining in-network processing to preserve resources (per online measurement) and then having to consume resources (per offline reorganization) to maintain effective detection performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4177682/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4177682/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9430607","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Message-Passing Algorithm for Optimizing Decentralized Detection Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Message-Passing Algorithm for Optimizing Decentralized Detection Networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"CDC-00-689.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052645S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176992","isNumber":"4176993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176992","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4176993","articleId":"4177682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4177692,"authors":[{"name":"Randy A.

We model the sampled-data system as a hybrid system and we employ a Lyapunov function with discontinuities to establish the stability of the system. Our stability and stabilization results are presented as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). By solving these LMIs, one can find a positive constant which determines an upper bound on the sampling intervals such that the stability of the closed-loop is guaranteed. The control design LMIs also provide controller gains that can be used to stabilize a given process.

For the case of a linear system with known dynamics, the classical Kalman filter provides an optimal solution (Jazwinski, 1970 and Gelb, 1974). However, state estimation for nonlinear systems remains a problem of research interest. There are two main approaches to approximate nonlinear filtering. The first approach is based on a linearization of the nonlinear dynamics and measurement mapping. For example, the extended Kalman filter uses the nonlinear dynamics to propagate the state estimate while using the linearized dynamics and linearized output map to propagate the pseudo-error covariance. The extended Kalman filter is often highly effective, and documented applications cover an extraordinarily broad range of disciplines. The second approach to approximate nonlinear state estimation foregoes an explicit update of the state estimate error covariance in favor of a collection of filters whose response is used to approximate the state estimate error covariance. These statistical approaches include the particle, unscented, and ensemble Kalman filters (Julier et al., 2000; Daum, 1995; and Houtekamer and Mitchell, 1998).

This occurs in areas ranging from the underwater robotics to the control of satellites clusters. Bandwidth limitations impose constraints on information exchange. Consequently, there is a strong need for developing methods that maximize the relevancy of the exchanged control information. In general, increasing the sampling frequency improves the disturbance rejection abilities whereas increasing the quantization precision improves the steady state precision. However, when the bandwidth is limited, increasing the sampling frequency necessitates the reduction of the quantization precision. In the opposite, augmenting the quantization precision requires the lowering of the sampling frequency. Motivated by these observations, an approach for the dynamical on-line assignment of sampling frequencies and control inputs quantization is proposed. This approach, which is based on the Model Predictive Control (MPC) technique, enables to choose the sampling frequency and the quantization levels of control signals from a predefined set, in order to optimize the control performance. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated on a simulation example.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Sampling methods","Frequency","Communication system control","Bandwidth","Communication channels","Robot control","Satellites","Steady-state","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous time systems","discrete time systems","predictive control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantization precision","networked systems","control information exchange","communication channel","sampling frequency","disturbance rejection","model predictive control","control signals"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.2006.377761","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 45th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 45th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4176992/4176993/04177871.pdf","startPage":"1135","endPage":"1140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4176993","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2006.377761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trading Quantization Precision for Sampling Rates in Networked Systems with Limited Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4177871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Trading Quantization Precision for Sampling Rates in Networked Systems with Limited Communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4177871/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4177871/","accessionNumber":"9398747","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trading Quantization Precision for Sampling Rates in Networked Systems with Limited Communication","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"CDC-00-878.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064064S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176992","isNumber":"4176993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176992","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4176993","articleId":"4177871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4177898,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Hammouri","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Automatique et de G\u00e9nie des Proc\u00e9d\u00e9s L.A.G.E.P., Universit\u00e9 Claude Bemard Lyon 1, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Hammouri","id":"37300773500"},{"name":"Madiha Nadri","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Automatique et de G\u00e9nie des Proc\u00e9d\u00e9s L.A.G.E.P., Universit\u00e9 Claude Bemard Lyon 1, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Madiha","lastName":"Nadri","id":"37300774800"},{"name":"Rafael Mota","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Automatique et de G\u00e9nie des Proc\u00e9d\u00e9s L.A.G.E.P., Universit\u00e9 Claude Bemard Lyon 1, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Mota","id":"37089122871"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0171-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4177898","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time measurement","Sampling methods","Observers","Riccati equations","Control systems","Particle measurements","State estimation","Observability","Kalman filters","Symmetric matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical engineering","continuous time systems","discrete time systems","Lyapunov matrix equations","observability","observers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gain observer","discrete time system","uniformly observable systems","chemical engineering process","continuous time dynamical system","discrete time output measurement","state estimation","parameter estimation","extended Kalman technique","discrete stationary Lyapunov equation"]}],"abstract":"For many physical processes, and in particular, chemical engineering processes, output measurements are discrete in time.

The first agent is located at the source of a disturbance, it can measure the disturbance with high accuracy and it can perform local actuation, while communicating with the second agent via a Gaussian channel with a prescribed signal to noise ratio. What remains of the disturbance, after the control action of the first agent, will hit the second agent after a fixed delay. The second agent has noisy measurements as well as the information conveyed through the communication channel to decide on the best strategy to reduce the effects of the remaining disturbance. The control design paradigm is to minimize a quadratic cost combining the control power of the first agent and the final effect of the disturbance at the second agent. Such a framework can be viewed as an extension of the well known Witsenhausen's counter-example which did not include a communication channel. In the absence of a channel, Hans Witsenhausen has shown, by means of an example, that nonlinear strategies outperform the best linear strategy. This result is not obvious because the framework is linear and Gaussian, and the cost is quadratic. In this paper, we give an example illustrating that Witsenhausen's conclusion holds for our framework where a communication channel is present. We provide numerical results showing that, for a large range of the signal to noise ratio at the channel, nonlinear strategies strongly out-perform the best linear strategies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4177961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4177961/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9398819","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Witsenhausen's Counter Example Holds in the Presence of Side Information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Witsenhausen's Counter Example Holds in the Presence of Side Information","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"CDC-00-968.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051587S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4176992","isNumber":"4176993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4176992","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4176993","articleId":"4177961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4177969,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher M.

The complexity measure used is the cardinality of the state space of the underlying Markov chain. In the first step, hidden Markov models are associated with a certain class of stochastic jump linear systems, namely the ones where the parametric input is a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables. The image of the high dimensional hidden Markov model in this class of stochastic jump linear systems is simplified by means of a balanced truncation algorithm, which was developed by Kotsalis (2006).

Tokamaks, which are the major and most promising magnetic confinement approach to fusion being pursued around the world, are high order, nonlinear systems with a large number of instabilities, so there are many extremely challenging mathematical modeling and control problems, which must be solved before a fusion power system becomes a viable entity.

Traditionally, highly skilled artists and animators construct shape and appearance models for digital character. They then define the character's motion at each time frame or specific key-frames in a motion sequence to create a digital performance. Increasingly, producers are using motion capture technology to record animations from an actor's performance. This technology reduces animation production time and captures natural movements to create a more believable production. However, motion capture requires the use of specialist suits and markers and only records skeletal motion. It lacks the detailed secondary surface dynamics of cloth and hair that provide the visual realism of a live performance. Over the last decade, we have investigated studio capture technology with the objective of creating models of real people that accurately reflect the time-varying shape and appearance of the whole body with clothing. Surface capture is a fully automated system for capturing a human's shape and appearance as well as motion from multiple video cameras to create highly realistic animated content from an actor's performance in full wardrobe.

A short survey of the most recent publications is presented to support the options assumed during the definition of a framework for implementing circuits immune to bit-flips induction mechanisms in memory cells, based on a customized redundant infrastructure and on a detection-and-fix controller.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for Fault Tolerant Real Time Systems Based on Reconfigurable FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2006.355409","startPage":"131","endPage":"138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2006.355409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4178171","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4178170/4178171/04178242.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4178242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4178242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Fault Tolerant Real Time Systems Based on Reconfigurable FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4178242/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9529680","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for Fault Tolerant Real Time Systems Based on Reconfigurable FPGAs","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"ETFA-00-71.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055226S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4178170","isNumber":"4178171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4178170","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4178171","articleId":"4178242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4178249,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Saska","affiliation":["Informatics VII: Robotics and Telematics, Julius-Maximilians University Wuerzburg, Germany","Gerstner Laboratory for Intelligent Decision Making, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Saska","id":"37298817800"},{"name":"Martin Macas","affiliation":["Gerstner Laboratory for Intelligent Decision Making, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Macas","id":"37712673600"},{"name":"Libor Preucil","affiliation":["Gerstner Laboratory for Intelligent Decision Making, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Libor","lastName":"Preucil","id":"37550774800"},{"name":"Lenka Lhotska","affiliation":["Gerstner Laboratory for Intelligent Decision Making, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Lenka","lastName":"Lhotska","id":"37271828600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9758-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-0740"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-0759"}],"articleNumber":"4178249","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1584},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robot Path Planning using Particle Swarm Optimization of Ferguson Splines","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4178170/4178171/04178249.pdf","startPage":"833","endPage":"839","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2006.355416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4178171","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2006.355416","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Particle swarm optimization","Mobile robots","Intelligent robots","Laboratories","Decision making","Shape control","Robot control","Iterative algorithms","Collision avoidance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","particle swarm optimisation","path planning","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot path planning","particle swarm optimization","Ferguson splines","mobile robot","path description","cubic splines","car-like robot","evolutionary technique"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4178249","abstract":"Robot path planning problem is one of most important task mobile robots.

In this algorithm the macro-sequences (Ms) obtained from complementary sets of M sequences are used to obtain the impulse response of the environment. The signals received by the sensorial system are demodulated and correlated to find the transmitted signals. It is possible to obtain more detailed information from the environment through the analysis carried out over the correlated signal to extract the impulse response of the environment. In order to eliminate the cross correlation among the Ms and improve the localization of the correlation peaks, a post-process algorithm is applied to the correlated signal to find them with more accurately.

We analyze the performance of dirty-paper coding over MIMO keyhole channels. The keyhole condition, where the MIMO channel has only one degree of freedom, impairs the performance of the systems. Under these conditions, one may wish to design codes that are robust to this situation. We study the capacity and the probability of error of a MIMO system with BPSK over keyhole channel. We also prove the intuitive result that the capacity under keyhole condition can be improved using dirty paper coding","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4178390/4139314/04178492.pdf","startPage":"402","endPage":"407","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICECE.2006.355656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECE.2006.355656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4139314","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4178492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of Dirty-Paper Coding over MIMO Keyhole Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","MIMO","Channel capacity","Interference","Antennas and propagation","Radio transmitters","Fading","Receivers","Scattering","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel coding","error statistics","fading channels","MIMO communication","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dirty-paper coding","MIMO keyhole channels","multiple input multiple output fading","degenerate channels","error probability","BPSK","channel capacity","bit error rate","channel state information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dirty paper coding (DPC)","Keyhole","Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","Channel capacity","Bit error rate (BER)","Channel state information (CSI)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4178492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of Dirty-Paper Coding over MIMO Keyhole Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4178492/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9487713","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of Dirty-Paper Coding over MIMO Keyhole Channels","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"ICECE-00-102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059209S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4178390","isNumber":"4139314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4178390","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4139314","articleId":"4178492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICECEIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4178493,"authors":[{"name":"Rishad Ahmed Shafik","affiliation":["Islamic University of Technology, Gazipur, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Rishad Ahmed","lastName":"Shafik","id":"37295869200"},{"name":"Md.

A feature vector representing the second norm of details of fault currents of six levels of resolution is used to discriminate between different faults.

This method is able to detect not only the moving vector on a 2D plane but also the moving direction in a depth axis at very high speed such as more than 1000 fps. The proposed method uses not a normal block-based approach adopted by various smart sensors but a pixel-based approach using frame difference between neighbor pixels. Because of high inter-frame correlation at high frame rate, the 2D moving vector can be detected into a limited area which results in small column-parallel circuits on the sensor. In a depth axis, the moving direction is detected by object size changing. In this method, the detectable speed range can be controlled on the sensor and moved to lower speed by two methods. One is changing the reference timing for the frame difference from next frame to later frames and the other is changing the reference pixel position from neighbor pixels to interpolated pixels.","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2006 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/4178539/4178540/04178621.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"318","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2006 IEEE","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2007.355469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2007.355469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4178540","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4178621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Objects Tracking Using Smart Image Sensor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sensors","Optical sensors","Intelligent sensors","Object detection","High speed optical techniques","Focusing","Optical imaging","Smart pixels","Circuits","Optical detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","image sensors","intelligent sensors","object detection","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D objects tracking","smart image sensor","normal block based approach","2D moving vector","interpolated pixels","neighbor pixels","high inter-frame correlation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4178621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"3D Objects Tracking Using Smart Image Sensor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4178621/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9718304","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Objects Tracking Using Smart Image Sensor","confLoc":"Daegu, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICSENS-00-81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112475S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4178539","isNumber":"4178540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4178539","xplore-issue":"4178540","articleId":"4178621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4178622,"authors":[{"name":"Hongbo Zhu","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Electronic and Information Engineering Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hongbo","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37289612500"},{"name":"Hiroki Inubushi","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Electronic and Information Engineering Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Inubushi","id":"37295893300"},{"name":"Noriyuki Takahashi","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Electronic and Information Engineering Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriyuki","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37290899500"},{"name":"Kenji Taniguchi","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Electronic and Information Engineering Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Taniguchi","id":"37270851500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0375-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0376-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-0395"}],"articleNumber":"4178622","dbTime":"37 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sensors","Sensor arrays","Array signal processing","Transmitters","Image converters","Modulation coding","Intelligent sensors","Delay effects","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Background noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sensors","pseudonoise codes","ultrasonic transducer arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic 3D image sensor","PN code","FPGA board","ultrasonic transmitter","array receiver","ultrasonic wave modulation","pseudonoise code","array sensor","plastic balls"]}],"abstract":"We developed a new 3D image sensor consisting of an FPGA board, an ultrasonic transmitter, an array receiver and an AD converter.

We propose a new post-bonding immobilization process to prepare the enzyme layers within microfluidic channels of electrochemical biosensors. An array of Pt vertical electrodes is electroplated using a SU-8 mold. The cured SU-8 is then removed by plasma etching to expose the Pt electrode and to define the fluidic channel cavity simultaneously.

Additionally, the collection of the full data set should be performed in the most resource efficient way, thus prolonging the battery lifetime of the network. We introduce a new approach for energy efficient data collection through the use of staggered sampling. Staggered sampling means that at each sampling moment (epoch) only a small percentage of sensors collect (sample) data. The proposed approach leverages on statistical relationships between samples taken from different sensors and/or at different epochs for the prediction of the non-sampled sensor data. The main goal of the approach is to ensure complete collection of data during a periodic cycle while minimizing the number of sensor readings collected at any point in time. Complete data collection is confirmed by ensuring that each sensor is either sampled at each epoch or the data sample can be accurately recovered though model prediction of the sampled sensors. The proposed approach consists of two main phases. First, efficient modeling of the prediction relationship between two sensors using kernel smoothing over different time lags is performed. Second, the selection of epochs at which each sensor is to sample the data is determined. A 0-1 integer linear programming formulation is used to address this NP-complete assignment problem optimally on relatively large instances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on traces from actually deployed networks for sensor of two modalities: temperature and humidity.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4178540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2007.355584","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2006 IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2006 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/4178539/4178540/04178736.pdf","startPage":"777","endPage":"780","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2007.355584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Staggered Sampling for Energy Efficient Data Collection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Staggered Sampling for Energy Efficient Data Collection","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4178736/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9718394","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4178736/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Staggered Sampling for Energy Efficient Data Collection","confLoc":"Daegu, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICSENS-00-196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049303S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4178539","isNumber":"4178540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4178539","xplore-issue":"4178540","articleId":"4178736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4178743,"authors":[{"name":"Awais M.

In addition, observation of Random Telegraph Signal noise (RTS) in small-capacitance pixels is demonstrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4178946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4178946/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9572883","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Monolithic Sensors for Charged-Particle Imaging using Per-Pixel Correlated Double Sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithic Sensors for Charged-Particle Imaging using Per-Pixel Correlated Double Sampling","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NSSMIC-1-27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0565S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4143535","isNumber":"4178919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4143535","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4178919","articleId":"4178946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4179007,"authors":[{"name":"P.

At each turn, there will be several thousands of data to record and process in order to decide if the beams should be permitted to continue circulating or their safe extraction is necessary to be triggered. The processing involves a proper analysis of the loss pattern in time and for the decision the energy of the beam needs to be accounted. This complexity needs to be minimized by all means to maximize the reliability of the BLM system and allow a feasible implementation. In this paper, a field programmable gate array (FPGA) based implementation is explored for the real-time processing of the LHC BLM data. It gives emphasis on the highly efficient successive running sums (SRS) technique used that allows many and long integration periods to be maintained for each detector's data with relatively small length shift registers that can be built around the embedded memory blocks.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.356003","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4143535/4179079/04179157.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.356003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4179079","startPage":"950","endPage":"954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA Based Implementation for Real-Time Processing of the LHC Beam Loss Monitoring System's Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4179157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA Based Implementation for Real-Time Processing of the LHC Beam Loss Monitoring System's Data","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4179157/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9573141","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4179157/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA Based Implementation for Real-Time Processing of the LHC Beam Loss Monitoring System's Data","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NSSMIC-2-78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035145S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4143535","isNumber":"4179079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4143535","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4179079","articleId":"4179157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4179168,"authors":[{"name":"Attila Hidvegi","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Attila","lastName":"Hidvegi","id":"37272445400"},{"name":"Daniel Eriksson","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Eriksson","id":"37296518200"},{"name":"Bo Cederwall","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Cederwall","id":"37296518600"},{"name":"Samuel Silverstein","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Silverstein","id":"37272433900"},{"name":"Christian Bohm","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Bohm","id":"38288112300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0560-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0561-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"4179168","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data acquisition","Sampling methods","Energy resolution","Field programmable gate arrays","Real time systems","Ethernet networks","Pulse shaping methods","Shape","Data processing","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","data acquisition","field programmable gate arrays","gamma-ray detection","germanium radiation detectors","high energy physics instrumentation computing","local area networks","nuclear electronics","position sensitive particle detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high speed data acquisition system","segmented germanium detectors","gamma ray tracking","segment pulse shapes","DQ system sampling rate","analog-digital converter","high performance FPGA","Xilinx Virtex-IV","high speed ADC","real time data processing","embedded soft processor","offboard gigabit Ethernet communication","high speed communication link","ADC performance","ADC-FPGA interfacing","flexible processing algorithms"]}],"abstract":"When using segmented Ge-detectors for gamma ray tracking it is necessary to determine the segment pulse shapes with high accuracy. A high-speed data acquisition system with many channels, high precision and with high sampling rate is required. To find the optimum performance, we are investigating what can be achieved by a system with extremely high sampling rates, 10 bits @2 GS/s. There are many other applications for such a system. Higher sampling rates usually mean lower bit resolution of the ADC, but with oversampling we expect to achieve a very good energy and time resolution. The system uses high performance FPGAs (Xilinx Virtex-IV) to cope with the data rates delivered by the high speed ADCs and to make all the data processing onboard in real time. Control and monitoring is implemented in an embedded soft processor. This processor is also in charge of the offboard gigabit Ethernet communication. The final system will consist of several separate boards, each with a number of input channels that will have to communicate with each other in real time over a high-speed communication link. The processed result will be transmitted over Ethernet to final storage. The project introduces many challenging issues, which are being addressed in turn with different prototype designs. These issues are: the ADC performance, interfacing the ADCs to the FPGA, implementing the flexible processing algorithms and high speed interconnection between the boards.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.356014","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference

the resistivity and crystal orientation on the leakage current and radiation response characteristics have been studied. The detector with (111) oriented substrate shows higher leakage current than (100) orientation due to the higher interface trap density at the Si/SiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n interface. And high resistive substrate shows larger leakage current than low resistive one because of its wider depletion width at the same bias voltage. However, in case of (100) oriented substrate, the leakage current of low resistive substrate is larger than high resistive substrate at high reverse bias. It seems that thermionic field emission (TFE) current for low resistive substrate increased at high reverse bias. To compare the charge generation and collection for the radiation, we irradiated an X-ray beam to each detector and read the output current. The detector with (111) oriented substrate shows 20% higher output current than (100) orientation and it is independent on the resistivity of the substrates. The most influential factor on the output current is the thickness of the wafer.

The width of the reconstruction TOF kernel is taken to be equal to the measured coincidence timing resolution (tau). If tau changes (e.g., as a function of count rate), the TOF kernel used in reconstruction will not accurately model the measured data. The goal of this work was to assess the effect of using an inaccurate value of tau in the reconstruction TOF kernel. The Alderson phantom with 10-mm hot spheres was imaged on the Philips Gemini TF PET/CT system (585-ps intrinsic timing resolution). Distributions of hot spheres in 27- and 35-cm diameter warm cylinders were also simulated (trues only) for 300- and 600-ps timing resolutions. The data were reconstructed using up to 20 iterations of TOF-OSEM with 20 chronological subsets. For simulated data, reconstruction with a TOF kernel 10-25% narrower than tau led to a 3-12% decrease in contrast for all sphere sizes at the same background noise level because sphere events were misplaced due to the finite timing accuracy. Using a reconstruction TOF kernel 10-25% wider than tau resulted in a 3-7% increase in contrast. Even wider reconstruction kernels led to still higher contrasts for kernel widths up to 2-3 times tau, although at the cost of increased reconstruction time and slower convergence rates. For kernel widths greater than 3tau, the performance decreased, as the reconstruction approached the non-TOF algorithm. These trends were also observed with the measured data, although much less pronounced. The results indicate that contrast/noise performance is fairly insensitive to inaccuracies in the reconstruction TOF kernel, provided that it is not narrower than the actual timing resolution of the data.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.354230","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4143535/4179239/04179343.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.354230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4179239","startPage":"1723","endPage":"1727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of Time-of-Flight Kernel Accuracy in TOF-PET Reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4179343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Influence of Time-of-Flight Kernel Accuracy in TOF-PET Reconstruction","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4179343/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9551227","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4179343/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of Time-of-Flight Kernel Accuracy in TOF-PET Reconstruction","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NSSMIC-3-104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056512S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4143535","isNumber":"4179239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4143535","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4179239","articleId":"4179343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4179351,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew E.

However, since each APD is coupled to an LYSO/LGSO phoswich scintillator pair, an efficient crystal identification algorithm must be developed to meet the stringent requirements of CT data acquisition in single photon counting mode. We propose a new ultra-fast crystal identification algorithm based on a Wiener filter. This filter instantly recovers crystal parameters by minimizing a linear cost function. A simple one-dimension projection based discrimination is used to identify the scintillating crystal. The algorithm achieves a discrimination rate of 88% for low-energy X-ray photons (~60 keV) at a high count rate >1 M events/sec/channel when implemented in a field programmable gate array.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4143535/4179239/04179366.pdf","startPage":"1848","endPage":"1852","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.354253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.354253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4179239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4179366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real Time Implementation of a Wiener Filter Based Crystal Identification Algorithm for Photon Counting CT Imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photonic crystals","Wiener filter","Computed tomography","Positron emission tomography","Animals","Avalanche photodiodes","Parallel processing","Data acquisition","Nonlinear filters","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avalanche photodiodes","computerised tomography","image recognition","photon counting","positron emission tomography","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wiener filter","photon counting CT imaging","LabPET","small animal avalanche photodiode","APD-based PET scanner","parallel processing","computed tomography","positron emission tomography","LYSO-LGSO phoswich scintillator pair","CT data acquisition","single photon counting mode","ultrafast crystal identification algorithm","scintillating crystal","low-energy X-ray photon","field programmable gate array"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4179366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Real Time Implementation of a Wiener Filter Based Crystal Identification Algorithm for Photon Counting CT Imaging","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4179366/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9562468","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real Time Implementation of a Wiener Filter Based Crystal Identification Algorithm for Photon Counting CT Imaging","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NSSMIC-3-127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071068S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4143535","isNumber":"4179239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4143535","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4179239","articleId":"4179366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4179373,"authors":[{"name":"M.-A.

Real time digital signal analysis also filters out events outside the photopeak with crystal granularity to eliminate Compton events and electronic noise. Retained events are then merged into a single stream through a real-time sorting tree, at which end the prompt and delayed coincidences are extracted. A single Firewire link handles both control and data transfers with a computer. The LabPETtrade features four data recording modes, giving the user the choice to retain data for research or to minimize file size for high coincidence count rate and imaging purposes. The electronic system also supports time synchronized data insertion for flags such as vital signs used in gated image reconstruction. Aside from data acquisition, hardware can generate live energy and discrimination histograms suitable for fast, automatic channel calibration.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System Integration of the LabPET Small Animal PET Scanner","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.354260","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4143535/4179239/04179373.pdf","startPage":"1880","endPage":"1884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.354260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4179239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4179373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4179373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"System Integration of the LabPET Small Animal PET Scanner","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4179373/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9551250","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System Integration of the LabPET Small Animal PET Scanner","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NSSMIC-3-134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124745S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4143535","isNumber":"4179239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4143535","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4179239","articleId":"4179373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4179420,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Treatment planning systems are nowadays based on empirical methods which can lead to errors in the localization of the area to be irradiated of the order of centimeters. The use of Monte Carlo techniques permits to reach a more adequate precision but with the drawback of a computing time which is too high with respect to the requirements of a radiotherapy center. We propose to implement time consuming algorithms directly in hardware circuits based on programmable logic devices in order to speed up the computation. The hardware is based on a 'Configurable Computer', a PCI master board housing one or more high performance fPGA and a RAM large enough for the application.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.354306","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4143535/4179395/04179420.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.354306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4179395","startPage":"2004","endPage":"2007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monte Carlo Computations for Radiotherapy with the use of Dedicated Processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4179420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Monte Carlo Computations for Radiotherapy with the use of Dedicated Processors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4179420/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9551273","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4179420/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monte Carlo Computations for Radiotherapy with the use of Dedicated Processors","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NSSMIC-4-25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074652S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4143535","isNumber":"4179395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4143535","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4179395","articleId":"4179420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4179441,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Dun Lin","affiliation":["Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hong-Dun","lastName":"Lin","id":"38184101900"},{"name":"Guodong Sui","affiliation":["Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Guodong","lastName":"Sui","id":"37296317100"},{"name":"Cheng-Chung Lee","affiliation":["Department of BioEngineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Cheng-Chung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292819400"},{"name":"Robert W Silverman","affiliation":["Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Robert W","lastName":"Silverman","id":"37268297800"},{"name":"Graham Cole","affiliation":["Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Graham","lastName":"Cole","id":"37285416500"},{"name":"Joel Leong","affiliation":["Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Leong","id":"37296316400"},{"name":"Sung-Cheng Huang","affiliation":["Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sung-Cheng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37278583400"},{"name":"Michael E Phelps","affiliation":["Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael E","lastName":"Phelps","id":"37290141400"},{"name":"Hsiao-Ming Wu","affiliation":["Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hsiao-Ming","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279673400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0560-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0561-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"4179441","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"abstract":"Quantitative microPET imaging provides the capability of performing biochemical and physiological investigations. The collection of multiple blood samples over time is necessary for quantitative analysis. The procedure is challenging because the amount of blood volume is small in rats and mice. To overcome this issue, an automatic blood sampling system was developed using a novel microfluidic chip design to take serial blood samples (<0.25 muL per sample; 18 blood samples in current design) at precise times from rats and mice. In this work, we utilize a National Instruments DAQPad 6507 digital output computer interface to control the sampling on the chip via mini-pneumatic valves. The system provides a user-friendly GUI programmed by LabVIEW to setup the sampling information, which includes mouse ID, tracer selection and sampling volume and time sequences. It can be easily reconfigured to utilize new microfluidic chip designs as well as changes in the sampling protocol. Real-time sampling status and the output of sampling information is continually displayed. Our initial implementation of this design can automatically collect ~0.185 muL blood samples within less than 2 second intervals from a small rodent.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4143535/4179395/04179441.pdf","startPage":"2095","endPage":"2098","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.354327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.354327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4179395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4179441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Control System of a Microfluidic Blood Sampler for Quantitative microPET Studies in Small Laboratory Animals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic control","Microfluidics","Blood","Laboratories","Animals","Sampling methods","Mice","Rats","Chip scale packaging","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","bioMEMS","blood","computer interfaces","flow control","graphical user interfaces","microfluidics","microvalves","pneumatic control equipment","positron emission tomography","volume control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic control system","microfluidic blood sampler","small laboratory animals","quantitative microPET imaging","biochemical investigations","physiological investigations","small blood volume","rats","mice","automatic blood sampling system","microfluidic chip design","National Instruments","DAQPad 6507","digital output computer interface","sampling control","mini-pneumatic valves","LabVIEW GUI","mouse ID","tracer selection","sampling volume","time sequences"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4179441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Control System of a Microfluidic Blood Sampler for Quantitative microPET Studies in Small Laboratory Animals","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4179441/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9551253","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Control System of a Microfluidic Blood Sampler for Quantitative microPET Studies in Small Laboratory Animals","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NSSMIC-4-46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053703S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4143535","isNumber":"4179395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4143535","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4179395","articleId":"4179441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4179503,"authors":[{"name":"Michel Defrise","affiliation":["Department of Nuclear Medicine, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Defrise","id":"37268069600"},{"name":"Vladimir Panin","affiliation":["Molecular Imaging, Siemens Medical Solutions, Inc., Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Panin","id":"37268271300"},{"name":"Christian Michel","affiliation":["Molecular Imaging, Siemens Medical Solutions, Inc., Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Michel","id":"37268279600"},{"name":"Michael E.

This information leads to improved signal-to-noise ratio when imaging large patients [Ref. l]-[Ref. 4], see [Ref. 5] for additional references. The additional TOF measurement also has some side benefits, including faster convergence of iterative reconstruction algorithms and, when working with histogrammed data, an improved robustness to angular undersampling. The latter property has been exploited to reduce the number of axial and transaxial angular samples without compromising spatial resolution, thereby allowing a significant acceleration of fully 3D iterative reconstruction. This work pursues the study of 2D rebinning for TOF-PET. We investigate algorithms in which rebinning is performed separately for each axial plane parallel to the axis of the scanner, that is, for each pair of sinogram variables (s, phi). Such algorithms will be called axial rebinning algorithms. The TOF-SSRB method, for example, belongs to that family. Axial rebinning algorithms are attractive because they can be applied directly to the raw (s,phi) samples defined by the transaxial arrangement of the detectors in each ring. This eliminates the need to pre-interpolate the data on a grid of uniformly spaced s samples (the arc correction) or to fill gaps in the data due to missing detectors. In addition, maintaining the native (s, phi) sampling should allow a more accurate modeling of the transaxial point-spread-function (PSF) during 2D iterative reconstruction. The goal of this work, therefore, is to develop axial rebinning algorithms that are more accurate than TOF-SSRB. Two approaches are explored: an analytical approach (section II) and a discrete approach (section III).","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4143535/4179395/04179503.pdf","startPage":"2370","endPage":"2374","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.354389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.354389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4179395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4179503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete axial rebinning for time-of-flight PET","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Positron emission tomography","Iterative algorithms","Image reconstruction","Detectors","Signal resolution","Signal to noise ratio","Convergence","Reconstruction algorithms","Robustness","Spatial resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","medical image processing","positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete axial rebinning","time-of-flight PET","coincident photons","signal-to-noise ratio","patient imaging","TOF measurement","iterative reconstruction algorithms","histogrammed data","angular undersampling","3D iterative reconstruction","2D rebinning","sinogram variables","axial rebinning algorithms","TOF-SSRB method","transaxial arrangement","transaxial point-spread-function","2D iterative reconstruction","analytical approach","discrete approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4179503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Discrete axial rebinning for time-of-flight PET","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4179503/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9551364","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete axial rebinning for time-of-flight PET","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NSSMIC-4-108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068121S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4143535","isNumber":"4179395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4143535","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4179395","articleId":"4179503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4179540,"authors":[{"name":"William F.

This TOF \"mashing\" technique (less precise transaxial axial angular sampling) together with single-slice rebinning (SSRB) and reduced MSRB (\"M\" for multiple) allows much smaller, more optimized TOF projection data space sizes without significant loss in image resolution. This \"works in progress\" article presents methods for providing both nearest-neighbor rebinning and TOF mashing in general-purpose on-line hardware. Mechanisms to support both TOF axial rebinning and TOF-MSRB are in place but require more validation. The Siemens PDR (PETLINKtrade DMA Rebinner) card has been previously presented for fast and effective LOR-to-projection-space mapping in other PET applications. Here we apply the PDR card for yet another tough and interesting application. In this case, the PDR architecture - which makes use of FPGAs and flash memory - supports nearest-neighbor rebinning, transaxial TOF mashing and TOF-MSRB for the Siemens Long-Axis TOF PET/CT prototype. The TOF PET portion of this PET/CT system supports 52 rings of (4times4times20mm) LSO crystals (624 crystals/ring), a 70 cm dia. FOV with a 22 cm axial length, and a 500 ps FWHM intrinsic TOF resolution. As with previous PDR applications, internal rebinning throughput of 13 to 15 M event packets per second is possible. PDR throughput via PCI to local RAID is in excess of 7 M event packets per second.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mashups","Sampling methods","Positron emission tomography","Computed

The experimental results confirm that the ratio of prompts (or trues) to randoms was improved because a smaller timing window could be used. \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">18</sup>\nF-fluoride rat bone scan data was reconstructed with our fully 3-D MLEM with a highly accurate detector response model using Monte Carlo simulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Coincidence Processing for the RatCAP Conscious Rat Brain PET Scanner","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.356516","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4143535/4179561/04179673.pdf","startPage":"3045","endPage":"3048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.356516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4179561","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4179673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4179673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Digital Coincidence Processing for the RatCAP Conscious Rat Brain PET Scanner","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4179673/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9572827","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Coincidence Processing for the RatCAP Conscious Rat Brain PET Scanner","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NSSMIC-5-112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057126S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4143535","isNumber":"4179561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4143535","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4179561","articleId":"4179673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4179698,"authors":[{"name":"Shaoying Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Shaoying","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292596200"},{"name":"Michael A.

As a consequence of this accuracy, it suffers from a relatively low detection efficiency, and thus long computation times. One technique used to improve the speed of MC modeling is the effective and well established variance reduction technique (VRT) known as forced detection (FD). With this method, photons are followed as they transverse the object under study, but are then forced to travel in the direction of the detector surface whereby they are convolved with a delta function determined from the probability density function (PDF). Another more sufficient method called convolution-based forced detection (CFD) is based upon the fundamental idea of FD with the exception that detected photons are rather convolved with a distance-dependent blurring kernel. In order to further increase the speed of MC, a method named multiple projection convolution-based forced detection (MP-CFD) is presented. Rather than forcing photon to hit a single detector, the MP-CFD method follow the photon transport through the object, but then at each scatter site, forces the photon to interact with the detectors at a variety of angles surrounding the object. In this way, it is possible to simulate all the projection images in SPECT simulation simultaneously, rather than as separate projections. The result of this is vastly improved simulation times as much of the computation load of simulating photon transport through the object is done only once for all projection angles. The results of MP-CFD agree well with the experimental data in measurements of point spread function (PSF's), with correlation coefficient (r\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) as 0.997. The speed of MP-CFD is shown to be about 60 times faster than regular forced detection MC with similar result.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4179561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.356541","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4143535/4179561/04179698.pdf","startPage":"3142","endPage":"3147","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.356541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerated SPECT Monte Carlo Simulation using Multiple Projection Sampling and Convolution-based Forced Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Accelerated SPECT Monte Carlo Simulation using Multiple Projection Sampling and Convolution-based Forced Detection","isConference":true,"volume":"5","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4179698/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9562513","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4179698/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerated SPECT Monte Carlo Simulation using Multiple Projection Sampling and Convolution-based Forced Detection","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NSSMIC-5-137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054104S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4143535","isNumber":"4179561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4143535","xplore-issue":"4179561","articleId":"4179698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":4179760,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The method takes into consideration normally-detected projection data which are not detected due to motion. Furthermore, it incorporates information from all detected events, particularly those which, following correction for motion, fall outside the FoV (e.g. axially or through detector gaps), thus satisfying a mathematical requirement, elaborated in the text, that would allow accurate motion averaging of sensitivity factors in image-space (as opposed to projection-space). The proposed method has been extensively validated using phantom experiments as well as realistic simulations of a new mathematical brain phantom developed in this work.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4143535/4179711/04179760.pdf","startPage":"3331","endPage":"3338","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.353718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.353718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4179711","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4179760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Event-Driven Motion Compensation Incorporating All Detected Events","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Event detection","Motion detection","Image reconstruction","Positron emission tomography","Detectors","Scattering","Imaging phantoms","Spatial resolution","Motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","medical image processing","phantoms","positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event driven motion compensation","motion compensated reconstruction","high resolution PET","image space","phantom experiment","mathematical brain phantom"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4179760/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Event-Driven Motion Compensation Incorporating All Detected Events","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4179760/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9562560","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Event-Driven Motion Compensation Incorporating All Detected Events","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NSSMIC-6-49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081231S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4143535","isNumber":"4179711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4143535","xplore-issue":"4179711","articleId":"4179760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4179778,"authors":[{"name":"Sungwon Yoon","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sungwon","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37085732486"},{"name":"Angel R.

In the new architecture neighbouring pixels communicate with one another. Charges can be summed event-by-event and the incoming quantum can be assigned as a single hit to the pixel with the biggest charge deposit. In the case where incoming X-ray photons produce fluorescence - a particular issue in high-Z materials - the charge deposited by those fluorescent photons will be included in the charge sum provided that the deposition takes place within the volume of the pixels neighbouring the initial impact point. The chip is configurable such that either the dimensions of each detector pixel match those of one readout pixel or detector pixels are 4 times greater in area than the readout pixels. In the latter case event-by-event summing is still possible between the larger pixels. As well as this innovative analog front-end circuit, each pixel contains comparators, logic circuits and two 15-bit counters. When the larger detector pixels are used these counters can be configured to permit multiple thresholds in a pixel providing colour information. The prototype chip has been designed and manufactured in an 8-metal 0.13mum CMOS technology. First measurements show an electronic pixel noise of ~72 e- rms (Single Pixel Mode) and ~140 e- rms (Charge Summing Mode).","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4179711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.353767","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4143535/4179711/04179809.pdf","startPage":"3557","endPage":"3561","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.353767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Medipix3 Prototype, a Pixel Readout Chip Working in Single Photon Counting Mode with Improved Spectrometric Performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"The Medipix3 Prototype, a Pixel Readout Chip Working in Single Photon Counting Mode with Improved Spectrometric Performance","isConference":true,"volume":"6","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4179809/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9573232","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4179809/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Medipix3 Prototype, a Pixel Readout Chip Working in Single Photon Counting Mode with Improved Spectrometric Performance","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NSSMIC-6-98.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044535S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4143535","isNumber":"4179711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4143535","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4179711","articleId":"4179809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4179962,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Complete Single Chip AM/FM Radio Integrated Circuit","abstract":"We have developed a carmlete single chip AM/FM radio integrated circuit embodying all the necessary function for an AM/FM radio system. It includes the AM/FM front end, AM/FM IF amplifiers, AM AGC, AM/FM detector, audio pre and power airplifiers, variable capacitor diode for the FM AFC, tuning indicator circuit, electric volume, as well as a regulated supply. As a result, the application of this IC enables a complete AM/ FM radio system without any use of active ccmponents.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4179982/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1982","publicationDate":"Aug. 1982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","volume":"CE-28","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Complete Single Chip AM/FM Radio Integrated Circuit","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Complete Single Chip AM/FM Radio Integrated Circuit","sourcePdf":"TCE-vCE-28-n3-46.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047601S","chronDate":"Aug.  1982","isNumber":"4179936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"9","articleId":"4179982","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"}]
