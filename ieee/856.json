Efficiently and correctly predicting the future flows of various regions can improve traffic resources scheduling and reduce the possibility of accidents. However, factors which affect the change of traffic passenger flows are complex, including interlaced lines and stations in large areas, diversified traveling demands for people, accidents and bad weathers. So the predicting algorithms or models should be more sensitive to multiply elements and their effecting patterns. Recently, deep learning performs the excellent ability to extract high dimensional spatial-temporal characters in regression and classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a new modeling method for urban traffic passenger flows. Instead of the grid matrices, we quantify the relationship between stations and represent it by a undirected graph. Then we sort the stations by their passenger flows and construct the two-channels graph flows matrices as the input of deep convolutional neural networks. To increase the temporal information of inputs, we also combine the input matrices with recent historical samples. In addition, we add date markers to correct the final prediction flows to further improve the accuracy. Finally we evaluate our model with the real Beijing subway data and compare with other traditional models on short-term passenger flows prediction tasks. Experiments show that our model including multidimensional flows graph matrices and the deep learning model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18342460","htmlLink":"/document/8560019/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Graph CNNs for Urban Traffic Passenger Flows Prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph CNNs for Urban Traffic Passenger Flows Prediction","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"938000a029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122741S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8533596","isNumber":"8559978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8533596","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8559978","articleId":"8560019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560021,"authors":[{"name":"Jiasong Zhu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulatio Ministry of Land and Resources Key Laboratory of Spatial Information Smarting Sensing and Services Shenzhen University"],"firstName":"Jiasong","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37676443500"},{"name":"Weidong Lin","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulatio Ministry of Land and Resources Key Laboratory of Spatial Information Smarting Sensing and Services Shenzhen University"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086563069"},{"name":"Ke Sun","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulatio Ministry of Land and Resources Key Laboratory of Spatial Information Smarting Sensing and Services Shenzhen University"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086275448"},{"name":"Xianxu Hou","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering Shenzhen University"],"firstName":"Xianxu","lastName":"Hou","id":"37086464768"},{"name":"Bozhi Liu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering Shenzhen University"],"firstName":"Bozhi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086464835"},{"name":"Guoping Qiu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering Shenzhen University"],"firstName":"Guoping","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37273739100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9380-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9381-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8560021","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560021","abstract":"With the rapid development of modern road traffic network, the demand of automatic traffic understanding has become a vital issue for building the intelligent traffic monitoring system and self-driving techniques.

The first step of the approach is to carry out the small signal analysis using modal analysis (MA) to generate the training database. Then from labeled database and other historical data, a deep learning based method is employed to learn how to make the right prediction of SSSA in real-time, without the knowledge of future wind or solar data.

To reduce the disease burden and improve public health, algorithmic support is essential. To realize this, health data must be computer understandable, secured, ubiquitous, and interoperable. Medical and disease data entered into computers are unstructured natural language texts with medical jargons which a computer normally cannot understand. EMR (Electronic Medical Records) are data silos in the hospital and do not interoperate. In this paper we present Ethereum based future ready Proof of Disease (PoD) consensus protocol with a computer understandable single instance of truth. It will solve many challenges that electronic health records (EHR) or health information exchange (HIE) have failed to address.

In previous researches, authentication of watermark in IPs easily disclosures sensitive information of real embedded watermarks, where the evidence of identifying IP ownership may be attacked by illegal verifiers. Despite several watermark detection techniques can address the disclosure of sensitive information in detection procedure, the efficiency for such a detection remains relatively low. Besides, it may yield to large communication overhead on multiple authentication rounds. Motivated by the needs of robustness and efficiency, it is proposed in this work a leakage-resilient protocol to authenticate ownership of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) bitfile design using zero-knowledge proof. The prover can convince the verifier that he knows a secret in the suspected bitfile design via only one interaction. Real locations of watermarks are concealed through location anonymity. With the received authentication package from the prover, the verifier cannot obtain other useful information about watermarks. From experiments, we show that the proposed authentication technique achieves high efficiency and robustness on watermark detection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Leakage-Resilient FPGA-Based IP Identity Authentication Protocol","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","doi":"10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00083","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8533596/8559978/08560061.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559978","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Leakage-Resilient FPGA-Based IP Identity Authentication Protocol","conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8560061/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18342485","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Leakage-Resilient FPGA-Based IP Identity Authentication Protocol","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"938000a287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106998S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8533596","isNumber":"8559978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8533596","xplore-issue":"8559978","articleId":"8560061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560075,"authors":[{"name":"Qiaoxiang Xiao","affiliation":["Key Lab. of Knowledge Processing & Networked Manufacturing, Hunan University of Science & Technology, Xiangtan, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Qiaoxiang","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37086558156"},{"name":"Buqing Cao","affiliation":["Key Lab. of Knowledge Processing & Networked Manufacturing, Hunan University of Science & Technology, Xiangtan, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Buqing","lastName":"Cao","id":"38103977200"},{"name":"Xiangping Zhang","affiliation":["Key Lab. of Knowledge Processing & Networked Manufacturing, Hunan University of Science & Technology, Xiangtan, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Xiangping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086462080"},{"name":"Jianxun Liu","affiliation":["Key Lab. of Knowledge Processing & Networked Manufacturing, Hunan University of Science & Technology, Xiangtan, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Jianxun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292080900"},{"name":"Rong Hu","affiliation":["Key Lab. of Knowledge Processing & Networked Manufacturing, Hunan University of Science & Technology, Xiangtan, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37708587700"},{"name":"Bing Li","affiliation":["School of Computer, Wuhan-University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Li","id":"37280004600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9380-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9381-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8560075","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560075","abstract":"Discovering appropriate, user-desired Web services from massive Web services quickly and accurately for users to build valuable Web applications has become a significant challenge. Web services clustering has been proved to be an effective way for Web service discovery. Some recent research works exploit additional information (such as, tags or word clusters information) to argument LDA-based topic modeling for better service clustering. Although they definitely boost service clustering via mining more implicit topics and semantic correlation of service document, their performance still can be improved due to inherent disadvantage of LDA topic model and adopted clustering algorithms. To address this problem, we propose a Web services clustering method based on HDP topic model and SOM neural network. This method, firstly uses Word2Vec to expand the original Web services description document from Wikipedia English corpus and applies HDP topic model to model the expanded Web services description document to obtain the document-topic vector. At last, it employs SOM algorithm on the document-topic vector to achieve Web services clustering. The comparative experiments are performed on ProgrammableWeb dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method respectively achieves significant improvements of 486%, 54.0%, 35.8%, 47.1%, 39.0%, 28.6%, and 9.4%, compared with other seven service clustering methods.","doi":"10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00097","startPage":"397","endPage":"404","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8533596/8559978/08560075.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Web Services Clustering Based on HDP and SOM Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","pattern clustering","self-organising feature maps","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document-topic vector","Web services clustering","seven service clustering methods","SOM neural network","appropriate user-desired Web services","massive Web services","valuable Web applications","Web service discovery","word clusters information","argument LDA-based topic","service document","HDP topic model","original Web services description document","expanded Web services description document"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Web Services","Word2Vec","HDP topic model","Self Organizing Maps","Web Service Clustering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Web Services Clustering Based on HDP and SOM Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8560075/","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18342310","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Web Services Clustering Based on HDP and SOM Neural Network","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"938000a397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061751S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8533596","isNumber":"8559978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8533596","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8559978","articleId":"8560075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8560096,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Jia","affiliation":["Service Computing Technology and System Lab, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Jia","id":"37086561861"},{"name":"Zhi Zhou","affiliation":["Service Computing Technology and System Lab, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37071868800"},{"name":"Hai Jin","affiliation":["Service Computing Technology and System Lab, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Jin","id":"37086534803"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9380-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9381-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8560096","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","optimisation","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["input data placement","resulted performance-cost tradeoff problem","query characteristics","two-stage optimization","data movement","two-stage joint optimization approach","status quo approach","cross-edge analytics","emerging computing paradigm","edge computing","application datasets","performance logs","multiple edge sites","cross-edge datasets","raw data","low traffic cost","centralized cloud datacenter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["edge computing","big data","cross edge analytics","performance cost tradeoff"]}],"abstract":"As an emerging computing paradigm, edge computing has gathered much attention recently. With edge computing, application datasets as examplified by performance logs and activity records naturally span across multiple edge sites. Analyzing such cross-edge datasets is however, by no means trivial, since the status quo approach which aggregates the raw data to a centralized cloud datacenter incurrs high performance and cost overheads. To address this challenge, in this paper, we tackle the problem of speeding up cross-edge analytics with low traffic cost, through joint optimization of task and input data placement. The resulted performance-cost tradeoff problem is difficult due its non-convexity and the uncertainty of query characteristics. To address these challenges, we combine convex relaxation with a two-stage optimization. Specifically, a prediction of the query characteristics is used to determine the data movement when the data is generated, and then the actual value is used to decide the task placement when the query arrives. Evaluations using a production trace from a Facebook cluster highlight that, the two-stage joint optimization approach can reduce the total cost by up to 83% compared to the status quo approach.","doi":"10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00118","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8533596/8559978/08560096.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559978","startPage":"564","endPage":"571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing the Performance-Cost Tradeoff in Cross-Edge Analytics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing the Performance-Cost Tradeoff in Cross-Edge Analytics","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560096/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18342464","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8560096/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing the Performance-Cost Tradeoff in Cross-Edge Analytics","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"938000a564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078322S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8533596","isNumber":"8559978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8533596","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8559978","articleId":"8560096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560097,"authors":[{"name":"Yufei Chen","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yufei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086556599"},{"name":"Huihui Chen","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huihui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086558199"},{"name":"Ziyang He","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ziyang","lastName":"He","id":"37086557218"},{"name":"Cong Yang","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086563044"},{"name":"Yangjie Cao","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yangjie","lastName":"Cao","id":"37086560464"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9380-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9381-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8560097","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","electrocardiography","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","medical signal detection","medical signal processing","patient diagnosis","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Anterior Myocardial Infarction detection","myocardial infarction diagnosis","ECG signals","squeeze convolution","depthwise convolution","pointwise convolution","ECG features","single-channel convolutional neural network","MCL-CNN's rationality","multilead ECG classification","multichannel lightweight convolutional neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Learning, Convolution Neural Network, Electrocardiogram, Myocardial Infarction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560097","abstract":"Myocardial Infarction (MI) is one of the major causes of human death.

MCL-CNN utilizes the signal from each ECG lead in order to find the suitable filter to get the superior feature representation. On one hand, MCL-CNN uses the squeeze convolution, the depthwise convolution, and the pointwise convolution to extract ECG features, which has lower computational complexity than the traditional CNN. On the other hand, Adam optimizer is applied by MCL-CNN to improve the classification performance. Comparing to both the single-channel convolutional neural network and the multi-channel convolutional neural networks, experimental results show that MCL-CNN can achieve a superior metrics scores (i.e., Accuracy=96.18%, AUC=95.50%, Sensitivity=93.67%, Specificity=97.32%).

Unlike existing energy-efficient data collection models in WSNs, we present a hybrid data collection scheme based on Compressed Sensing (CS) to collect the compressed sensed data in an energy-efficient and load-balanced manner. In our proposed scheme, the data collection process is divided into the intra-cluster data collection process and the inter-cluster data collection process. By modelling the optimal clustering problem as a separable convex optimization problem, we can obtain the optimal clustering size and the optimal data transmission radius. Furthermore, a Cluster Head (CH) chain based on pseudo Hilbert curve is built to collect the compressed sensed data among CHs in an accumulative way. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only reduces the total energy consumption, but also effectively balance the distribution of energy consumption among CHs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8533596/8559978/08560104.pdf","startPage":"619","endPage":"626","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","doi":"10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559978","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Data Collection Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks Using Compressed Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","pattern clustering","power consumption","telecommunication power management","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","energy-efficient data collection models","hybrid data collection scheme","intra-cluster data collection process","inter-cluster data collection process","optimal clustering problem","compressed sensing","optimal data transmission","energy consumption","convex optimization problem","cluster head chain","pseudoHilbert curve"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless sensor networks, data collection, compressed sensing, clustering, Hilbert curve"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Data Collection Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks Using Compressed Sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8560104/","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18342271","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Data Collection Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks Using Compressed Sensing","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"938000a619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094509S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8533596","isNumber":"8559978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8533596","xplore-issue":"8559978","articleId":"8560104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560109,"authors":[{"name":"Haixiang Hou","affiliation":["Services Computing Technology and System Lab, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Haixiang","lastName":"Hou","id":"37086383501"},{"name":"Hai Jin","affiliation":["Services Computing Technology and System Lab, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Jin","id":"37086456514"},{"name":"Xiaofei Liao","affiliation":["Services Computing Technology and System Lab, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Liao","id":"37085372351"},{"name":"Deze Zeng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, China University of Geosciences, China"],"firstName":"Deze","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37648157100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9380-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9381-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8560109","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","differential equations","mobile computing","mobile radio","resource allocation","sensor fusion","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic analysis","fog computing","task dissemination phase","time allocation scheme","extensive simulation-based evaluations","optimal time allocation","encounter rates","ODEs","ordinary differential equations","sensing data","epidemic routing","service deployment","device-to-device communications","mobile computing applications","cloud service provision paradigm","D2D Communications","mobile crowdsensing","deadline-constrained MCS applications","mobile nodes","fog nodes","data collection phase"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Terms Fog computing","Mobile crowdsensing","Stochastic analysis","Epidemic routing"]}],"abstract":"As a new cloud service provision paradigm, fog computing has revolutionized many mobile computing applications, including mobile crowdsensing (MCS). In this study, we focus on the fog computing empowered MCS with device-to-device (D2D) communications, where both the task dissemination and data collection are deployed as services in the fog nodes (e.g., base stations), and the mobile nodes opportunistically forward both the tasks and the sensing data via D2D communications by epidemic routing. One natural question arose in such scenario is on the affection to the quality-of-sensing (e.g., coverage) from the service deployment. To this end, we are motivated to conduct a stochastic analysis on the D2D-based MCS supported by fog computing. In particular, we use ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the task dissemination phase and the data collection phase and derive the achievable coverage as a function of parameters such as the number of fog nodes exploited, the number of mobile nodes, the encounter rates. We also apply our analysis to find out the optimal time allocation for deadline-constrained MCS applications. Through extensive simulation-based evaluations, we verify the correctness of our analysis, with the average error less than 9.6%, and the optimality of our time allocation scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Analysis on Fog Computing Empowered Mobile Crowdsensing with D2D Communications","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","doi":"10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00131","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8533596/8559978/08560109.pdf","startPage":"656","endPage":"663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559978","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Analysis on Fog Computing Empowered Mobile Crowdsensing with D2D Communications","conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8560109/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18342313","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Analysis on Fog Computing Empowered Mobile Crowdsensing with D2D Communications","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"938000a656.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.158698S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8533596","isNumber":"8559978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8533596","xplore-issue":"8559978","articleId":"8560109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560111,"authors":[{"name":"Hailliang Zhao","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hailliang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37087546466"},{"name":"Wei Du","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Du","id":"37532598000"},{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086557826"},{"name":"Tao Lei","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Lei","id":"37086553894"},{"name":"Qiwang Lei","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Qiwang","lastName":"Lei","id":"37086555216"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9380-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9381-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8560111","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1176},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560111","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","energy consumption","energy harvesting","mobile computing","optimisation","quality of experience","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell capacity enhanced computation offloading","intelligent services","MEC servers","energy harvesting technology","high energy consumption","capacity-constrained mobile device batteries","multiserver scenarios","computation offloading strategies","resource competition","offloading execution","Lyapunov optimization-based dynamic computation Offloading algorithm","intelligent computation offloading strategy","QoE aware","multiserver mobile edge computing system","LODCO Algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["intelligent services, mobile edge computing, energy harvesting, computation offloading, genetic algorithm, greedy policy"]}],"abstract":"The increasing complexity of intelligent services requires new paradigm to overcome the problems caused by resource-limited mobile devices.

This gives rise to a fundamental and critical problem, i.e., how to schedule their workloads under the constraint of task dependency while strictly subject to the latency tolerance. In this paper, we attempt to solve this task scheduling problem in the scenario, where both the time and the energy consumed by computing and communication are sufficiently modeled. Since it is NP-hard to such a problem, we propose a greedy algorithm instead so as to obtain an approximate solution. Extensive simulations show that the performance of our proposed algorithm is approximately optimal.","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8533596/8559978/08560151.pdf","startPage":"977","endPage":"982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00173","doi":"10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fine-Grained Task-Dependency Offloading in Mobile Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fine-Grained Task-Dependency Offloading in Mobile Cloud Computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560151/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8560151/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18342263","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fine-Grained Task-Dependency Offloading in Mobile Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"938000a977.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086545S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8533596","isNumber":"8559978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8533596","xplore-issue":"8559978","articleId":"8560151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560153,"authors":[{"name":"Saqib Ali","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, P.

In such networks, the diverse IoT devices harvest the data from the remote environments and relay it to multiple intermediate agents over the wireless links towards the cloud for storage, analysis and decision making. Such systems require highly trustworthy data to guarantee accurate and timely decisions. However, in most of the cases, the IoT data becomes dubious during the transmission towards the cloud. Ensuring data provenance in such a heterogeneous multi-layered system is a critical security issue. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secure data provenance framework for cloud-centric IoT network by utilizing the immutable, deterministic and public nature of the blockchain smart contracts with the traditional cloud infrastructure. In the framework, the cryptographic hash of the device metadata is stored in the blockchain whereas actual data is stored off-chain i.e., in the cloud, making it highly scalable for a dense deployment of IoT devices in the network. Multiple smart contracts are stationed in the blockchain to guarantee the provenance receipt to the data stored in the cloud. The initial evaluation revealed that the proposed framework is highly acceptable in achieving the data provenance for large-scale cloud-centric IoT networks.","doi":"10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00175","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud

Transportation Modes with Low-Power-Consumption Sensors Using Recurrent Neural Network","abstract":"With the quick development of mobile Internet and the popularity of smartphones, smartphone-based transportation mode detection has become a hot topic, which is able to provide effective data support for urban planning and traffic management. Though the popular GPS based transportation mode detection method has achieved reasonable accuracy, this method consumes large power, thus limiting it to be used in smartphones. Here, we propose a novel transportation mode detection algorithm using recurrent neural network. In order to identify transportation modes with low power consumption, this algorithm only uses four low-power-consumption sensors (namely accelerator, gyroscope, magnetometer and barometer) which are embedded in the commodity smartphones. Furthermore, we exploited the good representative ability of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and applied it to recognizing the transportation modes to achieve higher accuracy. To filter noises, a preprocessing is applied. After calculating features, we adopt the LSTM learning algorithm to train a model of transportation mode recognition and employ this model to predict transportation modes. Extensive experimental results indicate that our proposed approach outperforms the compared state-of-the-art transportation recognition methods with 96.9% accuracy to detect four transportation modes, namely buses, cars, subways, and trains.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560169/","accessionNumber":"18342262","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8560169/","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detecting Transportation Modes with Low-Power-Consumption Sensors Using Recurrent Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Transportation Modes with Low-Power-Consumption Sensors Using Recurrent Neural Network","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"938000b098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102336S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8533596","isNumber":"8559978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8533596","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8559978","articleId":"8560169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8560173,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiyun Yu","affiliation":["Software College, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Ruiyun","lastName":"Yu","id":"37589341300"},{"name":"Xingyou Xia","affiliation":["Software College, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xingyou","lastName":"Xia","id":"37086555256"},{"name":"Yan Zhou","affiliation":["Automation of Process Industry, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086557989"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9380-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9381-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8560173","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","data communication","mobile computing","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algorithm samples original data","compressed sensing sampling rule","compressed sensing reconstruction algorithm","sufficient mobile nodes","CIDG algorithm","data fidelity","mobile crowdsensing systems","mobile devices","implicit cooperativity","peoplecentric information","un-transmitted data","information perception","cooperativity based data gathering algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile crowdsensing","Compressed sensing","Implicit cooperativity","Data gathering"]}],"abstract":"Mobile crowdsensing technology is a new paradigm put forward for information perception in recent years.

This paper proposes a Compressed Sensing and Implicit Cooperativity based Data Gathering Algorithm (CIDG) in Mobile Crowdsensing Systems. This algorithm samples original data based on the compressed sensing sampling rule, and transmits sampled data over the network. Particularly, this paper discovers and defines implicit cooperativity between data and further exploit it to estimate un-transmitted data, and finally recover the original data by exploiting the compressed sensing reconstruction algorithm. In the condition of sufficient mobile nodes in the network, the CIDG algorithm can recover all data in the whole sensing area using a certain part of data. The simulation results show that CIDG can remarkably reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network without losing data fidelity.","doi":"10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00195","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8533596/8559978/08560173.pdf","startPage":"1124","endPage":"1129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Sensing and Implicit Cooperativity Based Data Gathering Algorithm in Mobile Crowdsensing Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560173","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560173/","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Sensing and Implicit Cooperativity Based Data Gathering Algorithm in Mobile Crowdsensing Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18342285","htmlLink":"/document/8560173/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Sensing and Implicit Cooperativity Based Data Gathering Algorithm in Mobile Crowdsensing Systems","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"938000b124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053325S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8533596","isNumber":"8559978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8533596","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8559978","articleId":"8560173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560181,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Li","id":"37405877100"},{"name":"Keyue Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Keyue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086556699"},{"name":"Duan Xue","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Duan","lastName":"Xue","id":"37086555394"},{"name":"Yijian Pei","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Yijian","lastName":"Pei","id":"37086554988"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9380-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9381-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8560181","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":617},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560181","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile computing","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile edge computing environments","edge servers","random deployment algorithm","mobile terminals","K-means based edge server deployment algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile edge computing, K-means, edge server deployment algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In mobile edge computing environments, edge servers are deployed at the edge of the network to provide low-latency and high-bandwidth services for mobile terminals.

Moreover, these motions were applied to bed-exit prediction in several cases of disturbance and for beds of different structures, and the system accurately predicted bed-exit.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560184/","accessionNumber":"18342448","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8560184/","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bed-Exit Prediction Based on 3D Convolutional Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bed-Exit Prediction Based on 3D Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"938000b185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047221S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8533596","isNumber":"8559978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8533596","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8559978","articleId":"8560184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8560189,"authors":[{"name":"Fangsu Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Electronic Information, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Fangsu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086384048"},{"name":"Gaocai Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Electronic Information, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Gaocai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37278830200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9380-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9381-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8560189","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on Energy Minimization Data Transmission Strategy in Mobile Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8533596/8559978/08560189.pdf","startPage":"1211","endPage":"1218","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559978","doi":"10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00211","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing","optimisation","queueing theory","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["storage requirements","mobile terminal","green cloud computing","data transmission process","mobile cloud computing","average transmission energy strategy","unit data","transmission delay","data transmission queue model","energy minimization data transmission strategy","complex computing","optimal stopping theory","admission rule","data generated rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile cloud computing","data transmission","energy optimization","optimal stopping theory","secretary problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560189","abstract":"With the rapid expansion of mobile cloud computing and its wide appliance, as well as the improvement of user's performance requirements for mobile terminals, it is an inevitable trend for mobile cloud computing to shift the complex computing and storage requirements of mobile terminals to the cloud for processing.

In this paper, we focus on energy optimization in the data transfer process of mobile cloud computing. Based on the optimal stopping theory, an average transmission energy strategy for minimizing unit data is proposed with a given data generated rate and transmission delay. We construct a data transmission queue model with multiple application scenarios. Based on the secretarial problem of minimizing the average absolute ranking of candidates, an admission rule that is superior to the top k candidates is proposed to minimize the average energy consumption of unit data. Indeed, the rule has been proved that it has the best K. value. The experimental results show that the optimization strategy proposed in this paper has lower average energy per unit of data, more excellent energy efficiency, and better detection efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18342235","htmlLink":"/document/8560189/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Study on Energy Minimization Data Transmission Strategy in Mobile Cloud Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on Energy Minimization Data Transmission Strategy in Mobile Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"938000b211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09133S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8533596","isNumber":"8559978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8533596","xplore-issue":"8559978","articleId":"8560189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560201,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolong Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085377176"},{"name":"Md Zakirul Alam Bhuiyan","affiliation":["Fordham University, New York, NY, US"],"firstName":"Md Zakirul Alam","lastName":"Bhuiyan"},{"name":"Lianyong Qi","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Qufu Normal University, Qufu, China"],"firstName":"Lianyong","lastName":"Qi","id":"37532753900"},{"name":"Xuyun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Auckland, New zealand"],"firstName":"Xuyun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086560807"},{"name":"Wanchun Dou","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wanchun","lastName":"Dou","id":"37547250700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9380-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9381-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8560201","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","metropolitan area networks","radio networks","resource allocation","telecommunication scheduling","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load-aware resource scheduling method","virtual machine scheduling method","load balance analysis","load balancing","cloudlet management","dynamic load-balance distribution","mobile users","smart city","mobile devices","abundant access services","WMAN","wireless metropolitan area network","wireless area metropolitan network","Load aware management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloudlet","WMAN","VM scheduling","load balance","smart city"]}],"abstract":"Wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN) emerges to be popular and powerful to provide abundant access services for mobile devices in the construction of smart city.

However, it is still a challenge to realize the dynamic load-balance distribution of the performed mobile applications for cloudlet management in WMAN. In view of this challenge, a Load-aware Resource Scheduling method, named LRS, is designed to achieve the goal of load balancing. Technically, we present the load balance analysis for the cloudlets in WMAN first.

Nevertheless, the current Linux prefetching architecture is designed specifically for hard disk drives (HDDs). In recent decades, flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) have been widely deployed in the storage systems, especially as caches forming a multi-tiered storage system, to boost I/O performance. Since the access characteristics of HDDs and SSDs are drastically different, the data prefetching scheme of Linux must be re-designed. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a new data prefetching architecture, called Cross-Layer Adaptive Caching (CLAP), for multi-tiered storage systems. CLAP adaptively determines the prefetching depth by analyzing the degree of data access sequentiality and the characteristics of the accessed storage devices. From the experimental results, CLAP can successfully improve the I/O access performance in multi-tiered storage systems.","doi":"10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00271","startPage":"1582","endPage":"1586","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8533596/8559978/08560249.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Prefetching Scheme for Multi-Tiered Storage Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560249/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Prefetching Scheme for Multi-Tiered Storage Systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18362475","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8560249/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Prefetching Scheme for Multi-Tiered Storage Systems","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"938000b582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056476S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8533596","isNumber":"8559978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8533596","xplore-issue":"8559978","articleId":"8560249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8560273,"authors":[{"name":"Baichuan Liu","affiliation":["China National Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Baichuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086556323"},{"name":"Huawei Huang","affiliation":["Academic Center for Computing and Media, Studies.

The current research presents a faster detection framework (R-PCNN) combining the preprocessing and structure optimization of Faster R-CNN.

This article is based on the work of Overdue Prediction of Bank Loans Based on Deep Neural Network. And we propose to analyze the dynamic behavior of users by LSTM algorithm, and use the SVM algorithm to analyze the user's static data to solve the current prediction problems. This article uses users' basic information, bank records, user browsing behavior, credit card billing records, and loan time information to evaluate whether users are delinquent. These static data are the basic input for SVM. For LSTM model, we extract user's recent transaction type from browsing behavior as input to LSTM, to predict the probability of users' overdue behavior. Finally, we calculate the average of the two algorithms as the final result. From the experimental results, this LSTM-SVM model shows a great improvement than traditional algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18342292","htmlLink":"/document/8560290/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Overdue Prediction of Bank Loans Based on LSTM-SVM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overdue Prediction of Bank Loans Based on LSTM-SVM","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"938000b859.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058066S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8533596","isNumber":"8559978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8533596","xplore-issue":"8559978","articleId":"8560290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560298,"authors":[{"name":"Binbin Yong","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Binbin","lastName":"Yong","id":"37086520804"},{"name":"Xin Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086507565"},{"name":"Yan Liu","affiliation":["Baidu X-Lab Baidu Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086560823"},{"name":"Hang Yin","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Yin","id":"37086555703"},{"name":"Liang Huang","affiliation":["School of Physical Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086559719"},{"name":"Qingguo Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qingguo","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37400757200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9380-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9381-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8560298","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560298","abstract":"Network security is a complex and difficult problem, in which web injection is one of the most serious security problems, especially webshell.

We pre-classify the color fundus retinal images by CNN, and construct first-order potential functions of CRF. Then the linear combination of Gaussian kernel functions is used to construct the second-order potential function of CRF model. Finally, regional restricts method is applied that analyzes the consistency of the connected region labels and corrects the labels of each pixel by calculating the posterior probability mean of the super-pixel region. The combination of CNN and CRF not only uses the pixel's intrinsic features, but also the spatial context information to make the detection more accurate. The added constraints further preserve the local information of the target and infer the entire model through a mean field approximation algorithm. This improves the accuracy of detection of optic discs in color fundus retina images. Experiments show that the CNN-CRF model performs better than the existing algorithms for the optic disc detection in pathological images. It provides an effective solution to optic disc detection problem by inhibiting its vulnerability to noise interference such as peripheral lesions and pigmentation. We compare our results to recent published results on several retina databases and show that the CNN-CRF model outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE

electronic devices, such as smart meters, smart appliances, renewable energy resources and energy efficient resources. Some of these devices can be of low quality, especially for start-up smart grid companies in developing countries; and due to the large quantity of those devices, the number of faulty devices is usually much greater than the available maintenance workers. On one hand, the faulty devices are required to be fixed soonest possible to avoid energy and economic losses. On the other hand, because of the limitation on labour resource, the grid management system (GMS) has to assign workers to fix the most emergent faulty devices. Moreover the GMS has to also maximize the total number of faulty devices that a worker can fix within his working hour as well as the overall distance that he travels. In this study, a large-scale smart grid maintenance planning framework is proposed considering the above three factors, i.e., with limited number of maintenance workers, within their working hours, the number of most emergent faulty devices that can be fixed is optimized.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8560301/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18342279","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Intelligent Maintenance Planning of Smart Meter Reparations for Large-Scale Smart Electric Power Grid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Intelligent Maintenance Planning of Smart Meter Reparations for Large-Scale Smart Electric Power Grid","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"938000b929.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079727S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8533596","isNumber":"8559978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8533596","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8559978","articleId":"8560301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8560303,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Song","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Song","id":"37086556192"},{"name":"Qun Jin","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Jin","id":"37086459646"},{"name":"Ke Yan","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Yan","id":"37086388802"},{"name":"Huijuan Lu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huijuan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086501524"},{"name":"Julong Pan","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Julong","lastName":"Pan","id":"37086553734"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9380-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9381-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8560303","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"abstract":"Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a set of machine learning algorithms, which has been widely used in diverse domains. With the increasing size of datasets, the traditional SVM training algorithms for large-scale datasets become infeasible. Mathematical optimization and cascade parallelism are both popular strategies for accelerating SVM training. In these parallel methods, the use of appropriate parallel framework to reduce SVM training time has become a priority issue and a research focus. In this paper, we investigate and overview mathematical optimization algorithms and parallel technologies of SVM, and summarize parallel SVM solutions and application problems under different frameworks. We propose a Vote Parallel SVM to reduce the training time.

Recently, some of them are also offering IOT support. The combination of IOT and smart city is not an easy task, the data volumes are much higher than those addressed for industrial IOT. The complexity of IOT smart city solutions have been identified by a number of actors. The European commission started set up the EIP project for stimulating and concerting actions. The Select4Cities project of the European Commission and associated community http://www.select4cities.eu/ created a challenge to find research solutions satisfying a formalized set of functional and nonfunctional requirements. Snap4City presented in this paper is one of the solutions developed in response to that challenge. The solution proposed is capable to develop in few steps sophisticated IOT applications that can control city dashboards as well as IOT mobile applications. Moreover, a number of development and monitoring tools have been developed. Among them, in this paper, a special attention is given to the tools and solutions for monitoring communication performance and to perform the assessment of scalability of the IOT smart city infrastructure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560331/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18342288","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8560331/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Snap4City: A Scalable IOT/IOE Platform for Developing Smart City Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Snap4City: A Scalable IOT/IOE Platform for Developing Smart City Applications","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"938000c109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049059S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8533596","isNumber":"8559978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8533596","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8559978","articleId":"8560331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":8560358,"authors":[{"name":"Ishara Paranawithana","affiliation":["Pillar of Engineering Product Development, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ishara","lastName":"Paranawithana","id":"37085747547"},{"name":"Hsieh-Yu Li","affiliation":["Pillar of Engineering Product Development, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hsieh-Yu","lastName":"Li","id":"37085839428"},{"name":"Shaohui Foong","affiliation":["Pillar of Engineering Product Development, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shaohui","lastName":"Foong","id":"37086538394"},{"name":"U-Xuan Tan","affiliation":["Pillar of Engineering Product Development, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"U-Xuan","lastName":"Tan","id":"37086356436"},{"name":"Liangjing Yang","affiliation":["Zhejiang University/University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Institute (ZJU-UIUC Institute), China"],"firstName":"Liangjing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086314217"},{"name":"Terence Sey Kiat Lim","affiliation":["Department of Urology, Changi General Hospital, Singapore"],"firstName":"Terence Sey","lastName":"Kiat Lim","id":"37086537448"},{"name":"Foo Cheong Ng","affiliation":["Department of Urology, Changi General Hospital, Singapore"],"firstName":"Foo Cheong","lastName":"Ng","id":"37086353942"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3593-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2514-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3594-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2161-8070"}],"articleNumber":"8560358","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Ultrasonic imaging","Target tracking","Automation","Minimally invasive surgery","Three-dimensional displays","Force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","diseases","force feedback","kidney","medical image processing","medical robotics","motion compensation","surgery","visual servoing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force feedback","position-based admittance control scheme","image correlation-based block matching algorithm","robotic manipulator","kidney stone removal","percutaneous Nephrolithotomy surgery","ultrasound-guided involuntary motion compensation","realtime visual servoing","visual servoing framework","2D ultrasound image plane","handheld 2D ultrasound probe","fluoroscopy guidance","ultrasound guidance"]}],"abstract":"Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a minimally invasive percutaneous surgical procedure used for large kidney stone removal under ultrasound and fluoroscopy guidance. During the surgery, precise control of handheld 2D ultrasound probe is required but highly challenging as it depends on operator's experience, judgement and dexterity. To complicate the problem, kidney stone moves away from its 2D ultrasound image plane due to respiratory movement of the patient. This makes locating the kidney stone extremely challenging, if not impossible, further limiting the success of the initial needle puncture. Therefore, there is a need to bring automation to the intraoperative workflow to compensate out-of-plane motion of the kidney stone. Maintaining simultaneous control of appropriate contact force during visual tracking is also essential to ensure accurate percutaneous access to the target calyx. This work proposes a visual servoing framework to address the aforesaid problems. Our proposed visual servoing framework comes in the form of two stages namely; pre-scan and realtime visual servoing. Probe holding robotic manipulator firstly scans a small region around the target to construct 3D volume data, followed by out-of-plane target tracking using image correlation-based block matching algorithm. A position based admittance control scheme is developed to address the latent need of maintaining an appropriate contact force between the probe and patient's body during visual servoing. Experimental results show that proposed framework is able to track out-of-plane motion of kidney stone with a position error of only one frame while regulating the environment force feedback with a maximum error of 0.2N. By incorporating automation to existing surgical workflow, we hope to positively impact the way minimally invasive surgeries are performed.","doi":"10.1109/COASE.2018.8560358","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8536777/8560337/08560358.pdf","startPage":"1123","endPage":"1129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COASE.2018.8560358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasound-Guided Involuntary Motion Compensation of Kidney Stones in Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Surgery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560358/","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasound-Guided Involuntary Motion Compensation of Kidney Stones in Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Surgery","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18306896","htmlLink":"/document/8560358/","conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasound-Guided Involuntary Motion Compensation of Kidney Stones in Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Surgery","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070107S","chronDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8536777","isNumber":"8560337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8536777","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8560337","articleId":"8560358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560363,"authors":[{"name":"Hsuan An Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsuan An","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37086537658"},{"name":"Chen Fu Chien","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen Fu","lastName":"Chien","id":"37275380000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3593-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2514-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3594-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2161-8070"}],"articleNumber":"8560363","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560363","abstract":"The productivity of bottle neck influences the gross yield of manufacturing system significantly.

Using deep neural networks, the process of detecting pavement distress can be automated to a high degree. However, evaluations show that they perform relatively poor on road images, that are significantly different from training data. Therefore, we show, how the performance can be improved with a human in the loop. The basic idea is to enlarge the training dataset. Luckily, many unlabeled road images from previous inspections are available. Nevertheless, annotating all of them is labor-intensive, and thus, not feasible. Since only diverse data enable an increase in performance, selecting the right subregions of the images for annotation is the key. To achieve this goal, we model the network's uncertainty and incorporate it for selecting new subregions. Our experiments show that we are able to improve the network's performance with only a fraction of data that would usually be necessary to get the same performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Uncertainty","Annotations","Roads","Neural networks","Employment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","inspection","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","roads","structural engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public roads","deep neural networks","unlabeled road images","deep learning based pavement distress detection","human effort minimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/COASE.2018.8560372","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8536777/8560337/08560372.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COASE.2018.8560372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How to Improve Deep Learning based Pavement Distress Detection while Minimizing Human Effort","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"How to Improve Deep Learning based Pavement Distress Detection while Minimizing Human Effort","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560372/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8560372/","accessionNumber":"18293026","conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to Improve Deep Learning based Pavement Distress Detection while Minimizing Human Effort","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07676S","chronDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8536777","isNumber":"8560337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8536777","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8560337","articleId":"8560372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8560394,"authors":[{"name":"Parham M.

Generally, master and slave subsystems of a teleoperation process are robots with complex dynamics. This complexity makes the modelling process difficult, and usually with unavoidable uncertainties. Along with the latency through the communication network between the master and slave systems, the control problem becomes critical in terms of maintaining stability and performance of the system. Describing the modelling procedure and properties, this paper proposes an adaptive control scheme strengthened with a radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN)-based algorithm to cope with the model uncertainties and also for stabilisation in the presence of time-varying delays. Using Lyapunov theorem, the stability analysis of the overall system under the proposed control method is investigated. Furthermore, simulation and experimental studies show the effectiveness and performance of this control for a teleoperation system.","doi":"10.1109/COASE.2018.8560394","pdfPath":"/iel7/8536777/8560337/08560394.pdf","startPage":"252","endPage":"257","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COASE.2018.8560394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Adaptive Control of Teleoperation Systems with Uncertainties and Time-Varying Delay","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Adaptive Control of Teleoperation Systems with Uncertainties and Time-Varying Delay","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18293140","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8560394/","conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Adaptive Control of Teleoperation Systems with Uncertainties and Time-Varying Delay","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074449S","chronDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8536777","isNumber":"8560337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8536777","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8560337","articleId":"8560394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8560418,"authors":[{"name":"David A.

Cloud-based control systems are a solution that addresses these issues. Advantages of the cloud are the elasticity of computational power (Infrastructure as a Service) and a plethora of development tools (Platform as a Service). The developed solutions are based on a local control system with an additional connection to the cloud. Communication and control of the field level run centralised through this control system. To try for more flexibility, we propose an approach where individual components at the field level are directly connected to the cloud. They are equipped with computational resources, connected directly to a TCP/IP network and communicate with each other and perform control tasks. This had been made possible by ever-shrinking integrated circuits at lower prices. In this paper, a possible use scenario, hardware candidates, and firmware aspects are presented. For an initial examination, the findings were compared against requirements for cloud-based control in the application area of soft-tissue interaction. This proposed architecture will be the basis for a prototype in the future.","doi":"10.1109/COASE.2018.8560418","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8536777/8560337/08560418.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COASE.2018.8560418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture of a Cloud-Based Control System Decentralised at Field Level","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560418/","displayDocTitle":"Architecture of a Cloud-Based Control System Decentralised at Field Level","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8560418/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18306924","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture of a Cloud-Based Control System Decentralised at Field Level","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04619S","chronDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8536777","isNumber":"8560337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8536777","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8560337","articleId":"8560418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560430,"authors":[{"name":"Birgit Vogel\u2013Heuser","affiliation":["Institute of Automation and Information Systems, Technical University of Munich, Garching near Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Birgit","lastName":"Vogel\u2013Heuser","id":"38277090300"},{"name":"Luis Ribeiro","affiliation":["Division of Manufacturing Engineering, Linkoping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Ribeiro","id":"37546227600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3593-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2514-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3594-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2161-8070"}],"articleNumber":"8560430","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bringing Automated Intelligence to Cyber-Physical Production Systems in Factory Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8536777/8560337/08560430.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"352","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COASE.2018.8560430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560337","doi":"10.1109/COASE.2018.8560430","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Production systems","Fault tolerance","Conferences","Software algorithms","Fault tolerant systems","Software","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyber-physical systems","factory automation","fault tolerance","learning (artificial intelligence)","production engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous processes","control software","real time behavior","learning algorithm","fault tolerance","intelligent algorithms","factory automation","cyber-physical production systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560430","abstract":"Learning and intelligent algorithms are the basis for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS).

Moisture Conditions from Synthetic Aerial Agricultural Images","abstract":"Recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicles suggest that collecting aerial agricultural images can be cost-efficient, which can subsequently support automated precision irrigation. To study the potential for machine learning to learn local soil moisture conditions directly from such images, we developed a very fast, linear discrete-time simulation of plant growth based on the Richards equation. We use the simulator to generate large datasets of synthetic aerial images of a vineyard with known moisture conditions and then compare seven methods for inferring moisture conditions from images, in which the \u201cuncorrelated plant\u201d methods look at individual plants and the \u201ccorrelated field\u201d methods look at the entire vineyard: 1) constant prediction baseline, 2) linear Support Vector Machines (SVM), 3) Random Forests Uncorrelated Plant (RFUP), 4) Random Forests Correlated Field (RFCF), 5) two-layer Neural Networks (NN), 6) Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Uncorrelated Plant (CNNUP), and 7) Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Correlated Field (CNNCF). Experiments on held-out test images show that a globally-connected CNN performs best with normalized mean absolute error of 3.4%. Sensitivity experiments suggest that learned global CNNs are robust to injected noise in both the simulator and generated images as well as in the size of the training sets. In simulation, we compare the agricultural standard of flood irrigation to a proportional precision irrigation controller using the output of the global CNN and find that the latter can reduce water consumption by up to 52% and is also robust to errors in irrigation level, location, and timing.

The overall objective of improving the efficiency of the HDVs can be obtained by employing additional information about road topography, altitude or slope, traffic and weather conditions. To this aim, a cloud computing architecture is proposed to support the fleet companies to manage the HDV route planning. The cloud system receives the transport mission data (departure, destination, waypoints, maximum mission duration time, etc.) and calculates the best eco route and the optimal velocity profiles minimizing fuel consumptions by a cloud-based optimizer.

Hard to model interactions among the HVAC sub systems and between the subsystems and the building make the energy estimation problem difficult to derive using thermodynamics equations. This is clearly illustrated when we apply parameter estimation techniques to a physics-based model of a real building. To overcome this problem, we derive a data driven model for the same building using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This model incorporates the building dynamics by using information from the previous time step to forecast the current energy consumption. We employ a unique feature engineering approach to select the parameters of our input-output energy model. As a proof of concept, we conduct a comparative study of the LSTM model with Support Vector Regression and the AdaBoost regression to show its effectiveness in forecasting building energy consumption over a period of time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18293109","htmlLink":"/document/8560520/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Data Driven Method for Prediction of Energy Demand in Commercial Buildings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data Driven Method for Prediction of Energy Demand in Commercial Buildings","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046342S","chronDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8536777","isNumber":"8560337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8536777","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8560337","articleId":"8560520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560526,"authors":[{"name":"Yijie Peng","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Peking University"],"firstName":"Yijie","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085649477"},{"name":"Jie Song","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Peking University"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Song","id":"37713705700"},{"name":"Jie Xu","affiliation":["Department of System Engineering and Operations Research, George Mason University"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404863900"},{"name":"Edwin Chong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Colorado State University"],"firstName":"Edwin","lastName":"Chong","id":"37269698400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3593-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2514-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3594-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2161-8070"}],"articleNumber":"8560526","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"abstract":"We formulate the sampling allocation decision for feasibility determination as a dynamic policy in a Bayesian setting.

The computational results can help us gain insight into how to make better trade-off decisions among different objectives.","doi":"10.1109/COASE.2018.8560581","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8536777/8560337/08560581.pdf","startPage":"750","endPage":"755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COASE.2018.8560581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization Approaches to Airline Crew Rostering Problems: A Case Study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization Approaches to Airline Crew Rostering Problems: A Case Study","htmlLink":"/document/8560581/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18293039","conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Optimization Approaches to Airline Crew Rostering Problems: A Case Study","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12013S","chronDate":"20-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8536777","isNumber":"8560337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8536777","xplore-issue":"8560337","articleId":"8560581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560656,"authors":[{"name":"Shenghsun Cho","affiliation":["Stony Brook University"],"firstName":"Shenghsun","lastName":"Cho","id":"37086556075"},{"name":"Michael Ferdman","affiliation":["Stony Brook University"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Ferdman","id":"37395316000"},{"name":"Peter Milder","affiliation":["Stony Brook University"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Milder","id":"37403753800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8517-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8518-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-147X"}],"articleNumber":"8560656","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","formal verification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGASwarm","high throughput model checking","explicit state model checking","model checking process","regular software development process","FPGA model checker","reconfigurable explicit state model","state exploration","Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["accelerator","model checking","formal verification"]}],"abstract":"Explicit state model checking has been widely used to discover difficult-to-find errors in critical software and hardware systems by exploring all possible combinations of control paths to determine if any input sequence can cause the system to enter an illegal state. Unfortunately, the vast state spaces of modern systems limit the ability of current general-purpose CPUs to perform explicit state model checking effectively due to the computational complexity of the model checking process. Complex software may require days or weeks to go through the formal verification phase, making it impractical to use model checking as part of the regular software development process. In this work, we explore the possibility of leveraging FPGAs to overcome the performance challenges of model checking. We designed FPGASwarm, an FPGA model checker based on the concept of Swarm verification. FPGASwarm provides the necessary parallelism, performance, and flexibility to achieve high-throughput and reconfigurable explicit state model checking. Our experimental results show that, using a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA, the FPGASwarm can achieve near three orders of magnitude speedup over the conventional software approach to state exploration.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2018.00080","publicationTitle":"2018 28th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 28th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8529150/8530786/08560656.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2018.00080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8530786","startPage":"435","endPage":"4357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGASwarm: High Throughput Model Checking on FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560656","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGASwarm: High Throughput Model Checking on FPGAs","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560656/","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug 2018","accessionNumber":"18342178","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8560656/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGASwarm: High Throughput Model Checking on FPGAs","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"851700a435.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071401S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8529150","isNumber":"8530786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8529150","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8530786","articleId":"8560656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560674,"authors":[{"name":"Santhosh Parampottupadam","affiliation":["Mayor Street, National College of Ireland, Ireland"],"firstName":"Santhosh","lastName":"Parampottupadam","id":"37086538538"},{"name":"Arghir-Nicolae Moldovann","affiliation":["Mayor Street, National College of Ireland, Ireland"],"firstName":"Arghir-Nicolae","lastName":"Moldovann","id":"37086538017"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4683-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4684-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8560674","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":543},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data mining","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","regression analysis","security of data","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud-based real-time network intrusion detection","realtime network intrusion detection","cloud-based prototype system","multinomial models","network intrusions","deep learning models","deep learning library","machine learning models","deep learning based binomial classification","benchmark NSL-KDD dataset","H2O libraries","DeepLearning4J libraries"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network security","intrusion detection","deep learning","cloud computing","NSL-KDD"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560674","doi":"10.1109/CyberSecPODS.2018.8560674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberSecPODS.2018.8560674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560662","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Cyber Security and Protection of Digital Services (Cyber Security)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Cyber Security and Protection of Digital Services (Cyber Security)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8537418/8560662/08560674.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud-based Real-time Network Intrusion Detection Using Deep Learning","abstract":"Deep learning has increased in popularity with researchers and developers investigating and using it for various use cases and applications.

Consequently, the Industrial Control Systems components are exposed to sophisticated threats with weak security mechanism in place. This paper proposes a supervised energy monitoring-based machine learning approach for anomaly detection in a clean water supply system. A testbed of such a system is implemented using the Festo MPA Control Process Rig. The machine-learning algorithms, which include SVN, KNN, and Random Forest, perform classification tasks process in three different datasets obtained from the testbed. The algorithms are compared in terms of accuracy and F-measure. The results show that Random Forest achieves 5% better performance over KNN and SVM with small datasets and 4% regarding large datasets. For the time taken to build the model, KNN presents the best performance. However, its difference with Random Forest is smaller than with SVM.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Cyber Security and Protection of Digital Services (Cyber Security)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8537418/8560662/08560683.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Cyber Security and Protection of Digital Services (Cyber Security)","doi":"10.1109/CyberSecPODS.2018.8560683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberSecPODS.2018.8560683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A supervised energy monitoring-based machine learning approach for anomaly detection in a clean water supply system","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial control","nearest neighbour methods","pattern classification","random processes","support vector machines","water supply"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","clean water supply system","Festo MPA Control Process Rig","machine-learning algorithms","operating system platforms","industrial control systems","random forest","security mechanism","supervised energy monitoring","KNN","classification tasks","F-measure","SVM","telecommunications","smart cities","transportation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Industrial Control System","Energy Monitoring","SCADA","KNN","Random Forest","SVM","Anomaly Detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"A supervised energy monitoring-based machine learning approach for anomaly detection in a clean water supply system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8560683/","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"18306941","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"11-12 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A supervised energy monitoring-based machine learning approach for anomaly detection in a clean water supply system","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"04-Chapter4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078423S","chronDate":"11-12 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8537418","isNumber":"8560662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8537418","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8560662","articleId":"8560683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560712,"authors":[{"name":"Erik M.

In this paper, a cyber-physical false data attack detection mechanism is proposed to protect the operation of power transmission and distribution systems by automatically inferring underlying physical relationships using cross-sensor analytics in order to detect sensor failures, replay attacks, and other data integrity issues in real-time. We investigate a neural network based mechanism acting on voltage and current readings resulting from a wide variety of load conditions on the IEEE 30-bus power system standard and compare its performance with a support vector machine based mechanism. Experiments showed that 99% detection accuracy of replay attacks was achieved using the proposed neural network mechanism. More importantly, we showed that the best approach was to not create physics-based features using what we knew about the system, but rather to use a neural network to automatically learn the laws, and then use the outputs of that to build a classifier to identify whether and where data spoofing occurs. Thus, it is preferable to infer and exploit the physics using a single machine learning solution rather than to add features first and then build a detector.","doi":"10.1109/CSCI.2017.1","pdfPath":"/iel7/8554238/8560703/08560712.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSCI.2017.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Cyber-Physical False Data Attack Detection in Smart Grids Using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Cyber-Physical False Data Attack Detection in Smart Grids Using Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18342549","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8560712/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Cyber-Physical False Data Attack Detection in Smart Grids Using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"2652a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062264S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8554238","isNumber":"8560703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8554238","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8560703","articleId":"8560712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8560789,"authors":[{"name":"Elham Akbari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Elham","lastName":"Akbari","id":"38542622100"},{"name":"Qing Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086157139"},{"name":"Wenbing Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Wenbing","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086299438"},{"name":"Hamid R.

Several types of research have been developed to provide solutions to the problem of urban traffic. This paper aims to implement a Bio-Inspired Neural Network model to control urban traffic semaphores and present the evaluation of the model applied to a real scenario of a big city through simulations. Were considered characteristics such as vehicle speed, streets and avenues lengths, traffic semaphore positions and different traffic demands. The chosen scenario was the Paulista Avenue in the central region of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, well known for its high traffic demand. The Bio-Inspired Neural Network algorithm was compared with the fixed-time control, which is currently used for the control of semaphore phases in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo. In addition, the behavior of control algorithms was analyzed for low, average and heavy traffic demands. The performance indicators used were the vehicles average travel time and the roads occupation level. The results show that the Bio-Inspired Neural Network model is better in all the simulations made, with the different situations of traffic demands. Tests results show performance up to 44,67 % in terms of average travel time, if compared to the fixed time control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560806/","accessionNumber":"18342568","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8560806/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired Neural Network Model Applied to Urban Traffic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired Neural Network Model Applied to Urban Traffic","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"2652a303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072928S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8554238","isNumber":"8560703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8554238","xplore-issue":"8560703","articleId":"8560806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560813,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Regina, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085594839"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2652-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2653-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8560813","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560813","abstract":"This paper investigates the training performances of multilayer artificial neural network (ANN) architectures for the implementation of chaotic systems. The designed ANN models can be employed for pattern recognition and prediction of dynamic chaotic systems, in order to simulate and analyze brain activities captured by Electroencephalogram (EEG). Previous research shows that EEG signals demonstrate chaotic features. Chaotic systems can be represented by a set of mathematical equations, which can be used to generate the target outputs for training ANN. In this research, the Henon map is selected as an example for ANN-based chaotic system design. The optimization of ANN architecture is important for improving the performance of hardware implementation. ANN architectures with up to 3 hidden layers combined with different number of hidden neurons are compared by measuring the training performance using the mean square errors (MSE). The ANN training are carried out using three training algorithms: Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian Regulation and Scaled Conjugated Gradient. Nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) model is used for ANN architectures design. The training results demonstrate that the training performance can not be improved simply by increasing the complexity of the ANN architecture in terms of the number of hidden layers and hidden neurons. It is therefore necessary to optimize the ANN architecture on a case-by-case basis in order to improve the efficiency of the ANN implementation for specified applications.","doi":"10.1109/CSCI.2017.58","startPage":"345","endPage":"350","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8554238/8560703/08560813.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSCI.2017.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilayer Artificial Neural Network Design and Architecture Optimization for the Pattern Recognition and Prediction of EEG Signals Based on H\u00e9non Map Chaotic System","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","chaos","conjugate gradient methods","electroencephalography","mean square error methods","medical signal processing","neural net architecture","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","EEG signals","multilayer artificial neural network architectures","dynamic chaotic systems","ANN-based chaotic system design","ANN training","ANN architectures design","multilayer artificial neural network design","architecture optimization","pattern prediction","H\u00e9non map chaotic system","electroencephalogram signals","mathematical equations","mean square errors","Levenberg-Marquard algorithm","Bayesian regulation algorithm","scaled conjugated gradient algorithm","nonlinear autoregressive model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Network","chaotic systems","EEG","Nonlinear autoregressive model","dynamic time series"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multilayer Artificial Neural Network Design and Architecture Optimization for the Pattern Recognition and Prediction of EEG Signals Based on H\u00e9non Map Chaotic System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8560813/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"18342615","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilayer Artificial Neural Network Design and Architecture Optimization for the Pattern Recognition and Prediction of EEG Signals Based on H\u00e9non Map Chaotic System","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"2652a345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134802S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8554238","isNumber":"8560703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8554238","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8560703","articleId":"8560813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560818,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Zamudio-Reyes","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Higher Technological Institute of Alvarado, Alvarado, M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Zamudio-Reyes","id":"37086558078"},{"name":"Nicandro Cruz-Ram\u00edrez","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Research Center, University of Veracruz, Xalapa, M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Nicandro","lastName":"Cruz-Ram\u00edrez","id":"38347510100"},{"name":"Efr\u00e9n Mezura-Montes","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Research Center, University of Veracruz, Xalapa, M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Efr\u00e9n","lastName":"Mezura-Montes","id":"37078901000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2652-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2653-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8560818","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8560818","abstract":"In this paper, a new multivariate discretization algorithm called multiCAIM is presented.

CR has been considered as a tool to detect unused frequency bands called spectrum holes, which are not used by the licensed users, also known as primary users (PUs) and allocate this unused frequency bands to the unlicensed users also known as secondary users (SUs). The state of the frequency band can either be idle (Not occupied by the PU) or busy (Occupied by the SU). The SU have the ability to sense and use spectrum holes when primary users do not transmit data on the assigned spectrum. However, spectrum sensing errors may happen due to uncertainty of wireless channels and unpredictable interference. Because there can be unpredicted interferences.

With dynamic spectrum access (DSA), secondary users can opportunistically use the frequency spectrum of legal primary owners at idle time, as long as these primary users are not disrupted by interference. This ensures increased efficiency in wireless communication. However, cognitive radio (CR) is not without some significant attendant challenges such as in spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing, quality of service (QoS) provisioning, network topology flexibility etc. This research work is targeted at provisioning QoS in CR. We employ a Medium Access Control wireless standard, the ZigBee protocol in achieving this goal. This IEEE 802.15.4 is confirmed by simulation to be QoS-enabled, with inherent properties in favour of the cognitive radio network environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560880/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18342544","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8560880/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Approach for Quality of Service Provisioning in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approach for Quality of Service Provisioning in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"2652a709.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064146S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8554238","isNumber":"8560703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8554238","xplore-issue":"8560703","articleId":"8560880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8560980,"authors":[{"name":"Mary Qu Yang","affiliation":["MidSouth Bioinformatics Center and Joint Bioinformatics Ph.D. Program, Univ. of Arkansas at Little Rock - Univ. of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Mary Qu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37693499300"},{"name":"Shucheng Yu","affiliation":["MidSouth Bioinformatics Center and Joint Bioinformatics Ph.D. Program, Univ. of Arkansas at Little Rock - Univ. of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Shucheng","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086555454"},{"name":"Carolina Cruz-Neira","affiliation":["University of Arkansas at Little Rock, Little Rock, AR, US"],"firstName":"Carolina","lastName":"Cruz-Neira","id":"38277929600"},{"name":"William Yang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, School of Computer Science, Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A."],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085723504"},{"name":"M.

We develop secure privacy preserving across Personal Health Data (PHD) repository and single-cell genomics research for building an Innovative Systematic Pedagogy for Integrated Research - Education (INSPIRE) (http://americancse.org/events/csce2017/csce17_awards). In this paper we further build a novel, eclectic, and insightful framework based on classical and popular machine learning approaches to help us meet the educational challenge. Our framework focuses on using integrative research technologies to help solve \u201cEducation's Performance Prediction Data Mining Crisis\u201d (EPPDMC), by putting to rest issues associated with mining and making best use of big data for educational enhancement, such as multi-source education acquisition, data fusion, and unstructured data analysis. We exploit the uses of deep learning, text classification, and semi-supervised learning approaches to solve challenging problems that educators face when analyzing multiplatform big data involved in education, research and training students. Based on new machine learning approached we developed for genomic big-data research and in combination with machine learning methods (http://americancse.org/events/csce2017/keynotes_lectures/yang_talk) and the vast availability of education data available to us, not only can we utilize structured, unstructured, and even multi-media data, but while engaging in leaning intelligent thinking along the way, we can also maximize the utilization of big data by studying the motion and performance of these data. Hence we build the INSPIRE model that can further incorporate Student Face Expression in Class (SFEiC) to help educators and managers make further improvements as they become involved in the teaching-learning process. This research further facilitates the effectiveness of the INSPIRE model.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSCI.2017.219","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8554238/8560703/08560980.pdf","startPage":"1244","endPage":"1251","doi":"10.1109/CSCI.2017.219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Privacy Preserving across Personal Health Data and Single Cell Genomics Research INSPIRE Academic Pedagogy \u2014 Merging Big Data Multiplatform with Deep Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Secure Privacy Preserving across Personal Health Data and Single Cell Genomics Research INSPIRE Academic Pedagogy \u2014 Merging Big Data Multiplatform with Deep Learning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8560980/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"18342795","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8560980/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Privacy Preserving across Personal Health Data and Single Cell Genomics Research INSPIRE Academic Pedagogy \u2014 Merging Big Data Multiplatform with Deep Learning","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"2652b244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065763S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8554238","isNumber":"8560703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8554238","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8560703","articleId":"8560980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8561005,"authors":[{"name":"Rick L.

It uses low cost software defined radios (SDRs). IoT devices require connectivity for the transfer of data from the point information is gathered to the cloud and user community. In locations where multiband base stations provide connectivity, concerns over interference require the use `Smart Base Stations' which are able to minimize interference and maintain connectivity to IoT devices. Phased arrays can also prolong battery life of IoT devices, increase bit rate (more link budget), provide location services where GPS connectivity does not exist (inside locations), and improve jamming immunity. However, the cost of the hardware can be prohibitive for some applications. A trade study is performed to determine the optimum SDR for the demonstration and a prototype system is constructed and measured to show the feasibility of the approach. The work concludes with suggestion for further work which includes the use of a field programmable gate array to interface between the SDRs and the host system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561005/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18342555","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8561005/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Systems Engineering a Low Cost Digital Beam Formed Phased Array for IoT Connectivity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systems Engineering a Low Cost Digital Beam Formed Phased Array for IoT Connectivity","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"2652b393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053244S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8554238","isNumber":"8560703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8554238","xplore-issue":"8560703","articleId":"8561005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8561013,"authors":[{"name":"Ebrahim Alareqi","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computing Engineering and Computer Science, Jackson State University, Jackson, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Ebrahim","lastName":"Alareqi","id":"37086558825"},{"name":"Tirumale Ramesh","affiliation":["Booz Allen Hamilton, Herndon, VA"],"firstName":"Tirumale","lastName":"Ramesh","id":"37086560051"},{"name":"Khalid Abed","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computing Engineering and Computer Science, Jackson State University, Jackson, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Khalid","lastName":"Abed","id":"37427304700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2652-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2653-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8561013","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","data analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["functional heterogeneous processor affinity characterization","training data","affinity matching","heterogeneous computing systems","affinity mapping approach","Big Data applications","machine learning","Big Data processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["heterogeneous processors","GPP","GPU","FPGA","ASIC and DSP","machine learning","big data"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8561013","abstract":"Heterogeneous processors based on functionally diverse devices (GPP, GPU, FPGA, ASIC and DSP) may provide affinity for different types of big data processing.

Wireless and wearable sensors have become prevalent devices to monitor patients at risk for chronic diseases. This helps ascertain that patients comply by the treatment plans and also safeguard them during sudden attacks. The amount of data that is gathered from various sensors are numerous. In this paper we propose to use fog computing to help monitor patients suffering from chronic diseases such that the data is collected and processed in an efficient manner. The main challenge would be to only sort out context sensitive data that is relevant to the health of the patient. Just having a simple sensor-to-cloud architecture is not viable and this is where having a fog computing layer makes a difference. This increases the efficiency of the entire system as it not only reduces the amount of data that is transported back and forth between the cloud and the sensors, but also eliminates the risk that a data center failure bears with it. We also analyse the security and deployment issues of this fog computing layer.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8554238/8560703/08561069.pdf","startPage":"1747","endPage":"1752","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)","doi":"10.1109/CSCI.2017.304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSCI.2017.304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560703","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8561069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context Sensitive Health Monitoring Using Fog Computing","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","diseases","health care","medical computing","patient monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["context sensitive health monitoring","health informatics","Wireless Sensor Networks","WSNs","wearable sensors","chronic diseases","context sensitive data","sensor-to-cloud architecture","data center failure","fog computing layer","patient monitoring","data collection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fog Computing","Health Informatics","Wireless Sensor Networks","Cloud Computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Context Sensitive Health Monitoring Using Fog Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8561069/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"18342683","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context Sensitive Health Monitoring Using Fog Computing","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"2652b747.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102275S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8554238","isNumber":"8560703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8554238","xplore-issue":"8560703","articleId":"8561069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8561091,"authors":[{"name":"Woo Yong Lee","affiliation":["5G Project Strategy Section, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Woo Yong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086519772"},{"name":"Kyeongpyo Kim","affiliation":["5G Project Strategy Section, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyeongpyo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37964749800"},{"name":"Seungeun Hong","affiliation":["5G Project Strategy Section, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seungeun","lastName":"Hong","id":"37086554980"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2652-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2653-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8561091","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"abstract":"Ultra-wideband mobile communication systems that support hundreds of Gbps data rates require the use of very large bandwidths. To implement such an ultra-wideband communication system, a high-speed ADC is essential. Ultra-wideband (UWB) ADCs have been studied for many years to use very low resolution ADCs to reduce circuit complexity and power consumption. From the viewpoint of encoding theory, we try to solve the problem of low resolution ADC use. The compute-and-forward framework, which has been studied in the field of network information theory recently, uses a technique that allows the receiver to decode a linear combination of transmission messages. In this paper, we analyze the achievable channel capacity of a MIMO system that achieves diversity and multiplexing gain in a low resolution ADC environment using this structured code theory. In particular, the relationship between this achievable channel capacity and the quantization level q. The results of this paper are expected to be used as a theoretical basis for the development of UWB communication systems for high- capacity transmission system applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8554238/8560703/08561091.pdf","startPage":"1820","endPage":"1821","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)","doi":"10.1109/CSCI.2017.326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSCI.2017.326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560703","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8561091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ADC Resolutions of MIMO Systems in Structured Code Schemes on a Discrete Memoryless Symmetric Channel Environment","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","channel capacity","channel coding","circuit complexity","decoding","diversity reception","linear codes","MIMO communication","mobile communication","multiplexing","ultra wideband communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network information theory","achievable channel capacity","MIMO system","low resolution ADC environment","structured code theory","UWB communication systems","high- capacity transmission system applications","ADC resolutions","structured code schemes","discrete memoryless symmetric channel environment","ultra-wideband mobile communication systems","Gbps data rates","high-speed ADC","ultra-wideband ADCs","low resolution ADCs","circuit complexity","power consumption","encoding theory","compute-and-forward framework","UWB ADCs","receiver","linear combination decoding","transmission messages","multiplexing gain","quantization level","high-capacity transmission system applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile communication","wireless transmission","ultra-wideband","ADC","compute-and-forward framework"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"ADC Resolutions of MIMO Systems in Structured Code Schemes on a Discrete Memoryless Symmetric Channel Environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8561091/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"18342704","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ADC Resolutions of MIMO Systems in Structured Code Schemes on a Discrete Memoryless Symmetric Channel Environment","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"2652b820.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051468S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8554238","isNumber":"8560703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8554238","xplore-issue":"8560703","articleId":"8561091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8561143,"authors":[{"name":"Nariman Farsad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687308/8658205/8561143/farsa-2885288-small.gif","p":["Nariman Farsad received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science and engineering from York University, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2010 and 2015, respectively.

One is based on modulating information on the time between two consecutive releases of indistinguishable information particles, and one is based on using distinguishable particles. For comparison, we consider the synchronized modulation scheme where information is encoded in the time of release and decoded from the time of arrival of particles. We show that all three modulation techniques result in a system that can be modeled as an additive noise channel, and we derive the expression for the probability density function of the noise. Next, we focus on binary communication and derive the associated optimal detection rules for each modulation. Since the noise associated with these modulations has an infinite variance, geometric power is used as a measure for the noise power, and we derive an expression for the geometric signal-to-noise ratio (G-SNR) for each modulation scheme. Numerical evaluations indicate that for these systems the bit error rate (BER) is constant at a given G-SNR, similar to the relation between BER and SNR in additive Gaussian noise channels. We also demonstrate that the asynchronous modulation based on two distinguishable particles can achieve a BER performance close to the synchronized modulation scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TMBMC.2018.2885288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMBMC.2018.2885288","startPage":"239","endPage":"253","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687308/8658205/08561143.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8658205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication System Design and Analysis for Asynchronous Molecular Timing Channels","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6687308/8658205/8561143-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Communication System Design and Analysis for Asynchronous Molecular Timing Channels","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2019","accessionNumber":"18630172","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8561143/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-0939370"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"PDF-471342-2015"},{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2017R1A1A1A05001439"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Communication System Design and Analysis for Asynchronous Molecular Timing Channels","sourcePdf":"tmbmc-chae-2885288-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153783S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6687308","isNumber":"8658205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687308","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8658205","articleId":"8561143","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8561144,"authors":[{"name":"Yunfei Yin","affiliation":["School of Astronautics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/9325575/8561144/yin-2876322-small.gif","p":["Yunfei Yin received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and automation from China Petroleum University, Dongying, China, in 2013, and the M.E. degree in control theory and control engineering from Bohai University, Jinzhou, China, in 2016.

In this paper, a radar waveform design method for target parameter estimation is proposed. Target time delay parameter is used as an example. The case where the two systems are not colocated is considered. Radar waveform optimization is performed using statistical criteria associated with estimation performance, namely Fisher Information (FI) and Cram\u00e9r-Rao Bound (CRB). Expressions for FI and CRB are analytically derived. Optimization of waveforms is performed by imposing constraints on the total transmitted radar power, constraints on the interference caused to the communications system, as well as constraints on the subcarrier power ratio (SPR) of the radar waveform. The frequency-domain SPR is different than the peak-to-average power ratio, which is computed in time domain. It is shown, using simulation results, that the proposed optimization strategies outperform other strategies in terms of estimation error. It is also shown that the SPR constraint reduces the delay domain ambiguities.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radar Waveform Optimization for Target Parameter Estimation in Cooperative Radar-Communications Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2018.2884806","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/8866758/08561147.pdf","startPage":"2314","endPage":"2326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2018.2884806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8866758","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8561147","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561147/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Radar Waveform Optimization for Target Parameter Estimation in Cooperative Radar-Communications Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8561147/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2019","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","accessionNumber":"19178688","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radar Waveform Optimization for Target Parameter Estimation in Cooperative Radar-Communications Systems","sourcePdf":"taes-bica-2884806-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105977S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"8866758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8866758","articleId":"8561147","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8561149,"authors":[{"name":"Antonia Gogoglou","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687317/9258584/8561149/gogog-2884505-small.gif","p":["Antonia Gogoglou received the 5-years Diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, and the PhD degree from the Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

However, unlike traditional hard disk, a garbage collection is required to reclaim memory space during data updates. A garbage collection includes a series of extra read, write and erase operations. Both write and erase operations are time consuming process, which affect the effectiveness and efficiency of the NAND flash memory system. Moreover, flash memory blocks are challenged by the limitation of the erase count. Thus, considerable efforts have been paid to reduce the garbage collection overhead and improve wear leveling. In this paper, an efficient and non-time-sensitive file-aware garbage collection algorithm, called FaGC+, is proposed. The FaGC+ algorithm involves a novel update frequency calculation method and a novel cold-hot logical page categorization scheme.

Both the proposed basic unit and cascaded topologies are compared with other state-of-the-art MLC topologies. From the comparison results, it will be shown that the proposed topology has several advantages such as the reduced number of power electronic components, lesser number of dc sources, and blocking voltage. Moreover, the proposed MLC has reduced power losses and improved efficiency. The operability and feasibility of the proposed converter are validated through extensive simulation and experiments. Finally, the corresponding results affirming the predominance of the proposed topologies are presented.","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2018.2885209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/8887420/08561160.pdf","startPage":"2498","endPage":"2512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2018.2885209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8887420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Generalized Multilevel Converter Topology Based on Cascaded Connection of Basic Units","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8561160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561160/","displayDocTitle":"A New Generalized Multilevel Converter Topology Based on Cascaded Connection of Basic Units","volume":"7","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19100695","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8561160/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Generalized Multilevel Converter Topology Based on Cascaded Connection of Basic Units","sourcePdf":"jestpe-r-2885209-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120508S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"8887420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8887420","articleId":"8561160","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8561162,"authors":[{"name":"Ogun O.

The results show that using coarse-grained and fine-grained triple modular redundancy (TMR) over dual modular redundancy (DMR) improves the failure cross section by 3.29\u00d7 and 11.49\u00d7, respectively. The partitioning scheme that we used does not show a significant effect on radiation hardness.

In general, the input of the VQA task consists of an image and a related question. In order to correctly answer the question, a model needs to extract and integrate useful information from both the image and the question. In this paper, we propose a model named AnswerNet to tackle this task. In the proposed model, discriminative features are extracted from both the image and the question. Specifically, high-level image features are extracted by the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network, i.e., Deep Residual Net. For question features, the semantic representations of the question and the term frequencies of the distinct words are captured by long short-term memory network and bag-of-words model, respectively. Then, a hierarchical fusion network is proposed to effectively fuse the image features with the question features.

By employing the Mason function in the first place, it has been proven that ring oscillator with an inductive load can achieve higher oscillation frequencies compared to the other topologies. Then, by applying two-port analysis at the oscillation edge, the oscillation frequency as a function of circuit variables like passive network topology, number of stages, elements of the passive network, gain, and the phase difference between two ports can be achieved. In order to evaluate the maximum oscillation frequency, maximized frequency is applied to the space of variables. This analysis proposes a systematic procedure for designing an oscillator with maximum frequency in desired CMOS process for a known quality factor of passive elements. To examine the feasibility of the proposed technique, this methodology is applied to an optimal oscillator structure. The simulation results confirm that maximum achievable oscillator frequency is 20%-30% higher compared to the oscillator designed with conventional approach. The simulations are performed in the 0.18-\u03bcm TSMC technology.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2880923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8649697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2880923","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8649697/08561170.pdf","startPage":"587","endPage":"600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"What Is the Maximum Achievable Oscillation Frequency in a Specified CMOS Process?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"What Is the Maximum Achievable Oscillation Frequency in a Specified CMOS Process?","volume":"27","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8561170/","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18486043","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561170/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"What Is the Maximum Achievable Oscillation Frequency in a Specified CMOS Process?","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-miarnaimi-2880923-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087926S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8649697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8649697","articleId":"8561170","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8561185,"authors":[{"name":"Choong-hee Cho","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Korea University of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8667745/8561185/cho-2884988-small.gif","p":["Choong-hee Cho was born in Seoul, South Korea, in 1986.

In addition, it allows for resource sharing among the protection paths with different endpoints in a mesh network by coordinating the use of shared resources when multiple protection paths compete for these resources. Owing to limited protection resources and the preemption in consequence of priority comparison, the SMP introduces a new optimization problem whose objective is to find the optimal priority assignment that maximizes the number of protected services against any failure case for a given SMP network. In this paper, we recognize that the problem of finding the optimal solution is NP-hard and propose min-degree and capacity-density approximation algorithms, whose approximation ratios are presented with the maximum degree of services and the maximum capacity of segments of an SMP network. Moreover, we propose a depth-based algorithm that always finds the optimal solution for a hypertree-shaped SMP network. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of the protection ratio, which we define in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2884988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2884988","startPage":"2130","endPage":"2143","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8667745/08561185.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8667745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Priority Assignment Algorithms for Shared Mesh Protection Switching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"Priority Assignment Algorithms for Shared Mesh Protection Switching","volume":"67","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2019","accessionNumber":"18524280","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8561185/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010418","fundingName":"Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion"},{"fundingName":"Korean government (MSIT) (Development of ICT Core Technologies for Safe Unmanned Vehicles)","grantNumber":"2017-0-00067"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Priority Assignment Algorithms for Shared Mesh Protection Switching","sourcePdf":"tcomm-ryoo-2884988-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144349S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8667745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8667745","articleId":"8561185","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8561194,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-En Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8649697/8561194/hsieh-2880477-small.gif","p":["Cheng-En Hsieh was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 1987.

However, conventional stereoscopic video saliency detection methods mainly use independent low-level features instead of extracting them automatically, and thus, they ignore the intrinsic relationship between the spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel stereoscopic video saliency detection method based on 3D convolutional neural networks, namely, deep 3D video saliency (Deep3DSaliency). The proposed network consists of two sub-models: spatiotemporal saliency model (STSM) and stereoscopic saliency aware model (SSAM). STSM directly takes three consecutive video frames as the input to extract visual spatiotemporal features, while SSAM attempts to further infer the depth and semantic features from the left and right video frames by shared parameters from STSM. The visual spatiotemporal features from STSM and the depth and semantic features from SSAM are learned by an alternating optimization scheme. Finally, all these saliency-related features are combined together for the final stereoscopic saliency detection via 3D deconvolution. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed model over other existing ones in saliency estimation for 3D video sequences.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2018.2885229","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8614380/08561195.pdf","startPage":"2305","endPage":"2318","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2018.2885229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8614380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep3DSaliency: Deep Stereoscopic Video Saliency Detection Model by 3D Convolutional Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561195/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"Deep3DSaliency: Deep Stereoscopic Video Saliency Detection Model by 3D Convolutional Networks","volume":"28","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2019","accessionNumber":"18410002","pubMedId":"30530363","publicationDate":"May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8561195/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61822109, 61571212, 61772328 and 61461021"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004479","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province","grantNumber":"20181BBH80002"},{"fundingName":"Henry Fok Education Foundation","grantNumber":"161061"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"Beijing Nova Program","grantNumber":"Z181100006218063"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep3DSaliency: Deep Stereoscopic Video Saliency Detection Model by 3D Convolutional Networks","sourcePdf":"tip-fang-2885229-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1953S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8614380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8614380","articleId":"8561195","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8561203,"authors":[{"name":"Taehyun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8612978/8561203/tlee-2885078-small.gif","p":["Taehyun Lee received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2013.","He is currently with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University.

This paper aims to analyze the stochastic stability of islanded microgrids in the presence of random denial of service (DoS) attack and propose a mode-dependent resilient controller to mitigate the influence of DoS attacks. Specifically, the small-signal model of the microgrid under the DoS attack is integrated as a stochastic jump system with state continuity disruptions. A new vulnerability metric is defined by using observability Gramians of the stochastic jump system, to measure the vulnerability of the system regarding DoS attack choices. The Lyapunov function analysis is conducted to find conditions sustaining the stochastic stability of the islanded microgrid in the form of linear matrix inequalities. A mode-dependent control approach is proposed for microgrids to mitigate the influence of random DoS attacks. In case studies, the vulnerability analysis and time-domain simulation results show the performance of the investigated microgrid can be degraded when the random DoS attacks exist. When the proposed mode-based secondary frequency controllers are installed, the islanded microgrid can sustain its stability during the attacking period and system dynamics rapidly converge when the DoS attack is over.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2018.2885170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2018.2885170","startPage":"4066","endPage":"4075","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8755890/08561209.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8755890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Stability Analysis and Control of Secondary Frequency Regulation for Islanded Microgrids Under Random Denial of Service Attacks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561209/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Stability Analysis and Control of Secondary Frequency Regulation for Islanded Microgrids Under Random Denial of Service Attacks","volume":"15","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18794416","publicationDate":"July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8561209/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61703031 and 61525303"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"4184095"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Stability Analysis and Control of Secondary Frequency Regulation for Islanded Microgrids Under Random Denial of Service Attacks","sourcePdf":"tii-liu-2885170-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105694S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8755890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8755890","articleId":"8561209","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8561211,"authors":[{"name":"Donkyu Baek","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8649697/8561211/baek-2880441-small.gif","p":["Donkyu Baek (M\u201917) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2009, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea, in 2011 and 2017, respectively.","Since 2017, he has been a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the School of Electrical Engineering, KAIST.

However, at the same time, a large-capacity battery pack not only occupies a big space but also significantly increases the vehicle weight, which directly impacts the fuel economy and vehicle performance. This implies that increasing the battery capacity has an obvious limitation in extending the EV range. In this paper, we introduce a system-level framework to extend the range of BEV with the consideration of the vehicle dynamics, electric powertrain characteristics, road slopes, payload, and regenerative braking. This paper particularly takes into account driving time so that the resultant BEV power management does not impractically slow down the vehicle velocity. The BEV power management framework derives energy-aware velocity planning, i.e., a desirable instantaneous velocity at each distance step (or at each time instant). The major technical contributions of this paper compared with the previous work include: 1) practically applicable velocity planning for production BEVs from superb BEV power model fidelity; 2) new performance metrics to consider both driving energy and driving time: energy-delay product (EDP), energy-square-delay product, and energy-cubic-delay product; 3) heuristics to derive EDP-aware velocity planning; 4) comparative analysis of the velocity planning between BEV and internal combustion engine vehicles; and 5) analysis of the model fidelity impact on the energy-aware velocity planning. The proposed method results in up to a 46.2% improvement of the EDP compared with the least-energy constant velocity driving.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2880441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2880441","startPage":"549","endPage":"559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8649697/08561211.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8649697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Runtime Power Management of Battery Electric Vehicles for Extended Range With Consideration of Driving Time","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"Runtime Power Management of Battery Electric Vehicles for Extended Range With Consideration of Driving Time","volume":"27","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2019","accessionNumber":"18473632","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8561211/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2015R1A2A1A09005694"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Runtime Power Management of Battery Electric Vehicles for Extended Range With Consideration of Driving Time","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-chang-2880441-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121296S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8649697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8649697","articleId":"8561211","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8561218,"authors":[{"name":"Guanghui Wen","affiliation":["School of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Guanghui","lastName":"Wen","orcid":"0000-0003-0070-8597","id":"37970245000"},{"name":"Wei Xing Zheng","affiliation":["School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematics, Western Sydney University, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei Xing","lastName":"Zheng","orcid":"0000-0002-0572-5938","id":"37085381202"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"8561218","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1191},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8561218","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Topology","Protocols","Symmetric matrices","Linear matrix inequalities","Network topology","Laplace equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","directed graphs","distributed control","Lyapunov methods","multi-agent systems","switching systems (control)","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tracking control","distributed consensus tracking","linear multiagent systems","directed switching topologies","dynamic leader","topology candidates","autonomous leader","nonautonomous leader","closed-loop MASs","tracking protocols","Lyapunov inequality","directed spanning tree","leader-following MAS","topology graph","multiple Lyapunov functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Directed switching topology","distributed protocol","distributed tracking","networking agent systems","switched system"]}],"abstract":"Distributed consensus tracking for linear multiagent systems (MASs) with directed switching topologies and a dynamic leader is investigated in this paper. By fully considering the special feature of Laplacian matrices for topology candidates, several new classes of multiple Lyapunov functions (MLFs) are constructed in this paper for leader-following MASs with, respectively, an autonomous leader and a nonautonomous leader. Under the condition that each possible topology graph contains a spanning tree rooted at the leader node, some efficient criteria for achieving consensus tracking in the considered MASs are provided. Specifically, it is proven that consensus tracking in the closed-loop MASs can be ensured if the average dwell time for switching among different topologies is larger than a derived positive quantity and the control parameters in tracking protocols are appropriately designed. It is further theoretically shown that the present Lyapunov inequality based criteria for consensus tracking with an autonomous leader are much less conservative than the existing ones derived by the M-matrix theory. The results are then extended to the case where the topology graph only frequently contains a directed spanning tree as the MASs evolve over time. At last, numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the analytical analysis and the advantages of the proposed MLFs.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2018.2885079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2018.2885079","startPage":"3796","endPage":"3803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/8818464/08561218.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8818464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Constructing Multiple Lyapunov Functions for Tracking Control of Multiple Agents With Switching Topologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"On Constructing Multiple Lyapunov Functions for Tracking Control of Multiple Agents With Switching Topologies","volume":"64","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2019","accessionNumber":"18942183","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8561218/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673104 and 61722303"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20170079"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP120104986"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Constructing Multiple Lyapunov Functions for Tracking Control of Multiple Agents With Switching Topologies","sourcePdf":"tac-zheng-2885079-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13267S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"8818464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8818464","articleId":"8561218","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8561219,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Frustaci","affiliation":["DIMES Department, University of Calabria, Rende, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Frustaci","orcid":"0000-0001-5795-4321","id":"37543009800"},{"name":"Stefania Perri","affiliation":["DIMEG Department, University of Calabria, Rende, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefania","lastName":"Perri","id":"37283398500"},{"name":"Pasquale Corsonello","affiliation":["DIMES Department, University of Calabria, Rende, Italy"],"firstName":"Pasquale","lastName":"Corsonello","orcid":"0000-0002-9528-1110","id":"37283399400"},{"name":"Massimo Alioto","affiliation":["ECE Department, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Alioto","orcid":"0000-0002-4127-8258","id":"37273061100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"8561219","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":450},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8561219","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Very large scale integration","Energy consumption","Art","Degradation","Discrete cosine transforms","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","energy consumption","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy reduction","ripple-carry adder","peak signal-to-noise ratio","energy-quality scalable adders","nonzeroing bit truncation","approximate addition","energy consumption","output quality","error-tolerant applications","innovative bit truncation strategy","quality degradation","truncation schemes","discrete cosine transform engine","silicon area overhead","noise figure 8.5 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive precision","approximate computing","energy-quality scaling","error-tolerant systems","low-power design","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"Approximate addition is a technique to trade off energy consumption and output quality in error-tolerant applications.

When applied to a ripple-carry adder, the proposed bit truncation approach improves quality by up to 8.5 dB in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, compared to traditional bit truncation.

Approximate computing is a viable method to save energy and increase performance by controllably trading off energy for accuracy. In this paper, we propose a tiered approximate floating point multiplier, called CFPU, which significantly reduces energy consumption and improves the performance of multiplication at a slight cost in accuracy. The floating point multiplication is approximated by replacing the costly mantissa multiplication step of the operation with lower energy alternatives. We process the data by using one of the three modes: a basic approximate mode, an intermediate approximate mode, or on the exact hardware, depending on the accuracy requirements. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed CFPU on a wide range of applications including twelve general OpenCL ones and three machine learning applications. Our results show that using the first CFPU approximation mode results in 3.5\u00d7 energy-delay product (EDP) improvement, compared to a GPU using traditional floating point units (FPUs), while ensuring less than 10% average relative error. Adding the second mode further increases the EDP improvement to 4.1\u00d7, compared to an unmodified FPU, for less than 10% error. In addition, our results show that the proposed CFPU can achieve 2.8\u00d7 EDP improvement for multiply operations as compared to state-of-the-art approximate multipliers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561229/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2020","publicationDate":"Feb. 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8561229/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2020","accessionNumber":"19282074","volume":"39","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Runtime Efficiency-Accuracy Tradeoff Using Configurable Floating Point Multiplier","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CRISP, one of six centers in JUMP, an SRC program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1730158 and 1527034"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Runtime Efficiency-Accuracy Tradeoff Using Configurable Floating Point Multiplier","sourcePdf":"tcad-peroni-2885317-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144662S","chronDate":"Feb.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8964044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8964044","articleId":"8561229","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8561238,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Jiang","orcid":"0000-0002-8209-9192","id":"37085515078"},{"name":"Zhilu Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhilu","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0002-3402-9093","id":"37291499600"},{"name":"Zhendong Yin","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhendong","lastName":"Yin","orcid":"0000-0002-7567-9084","id":"37289711500"},{"name":"Zhutian Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhutian","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-6952-4465","id":"37085775419"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8561238","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":695},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8561238","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Information rates","Wireless communication","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Relays","Resource management","Convex functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","autonomous aerial vehicles","convex programming","iterative methods","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum information rate","time horizon","sum-power consumption","successive convex optimization techniques","trajectory design","UAV-relayed wireless systems","unmanned aerial vehicle","temporary communication links","disconnected ground nodes","energy efficiency","transmission power budget","joint power-trajectory optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile relay","power allocation","trajectory planning","UAV communication"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is employed as relay to build temporary communication links for disconnected ground nodes.

The increasing of enormous smartphones, new complex scenarios, large frequency bands, massive antenna elements, and dense small cells will generate big datasets and bring 5G communications to the era of big data. This paper investigates various applications of big data analytics, especially machine learning algorithms in wireless communications and channel modeling. We propose a big data and machine learning enabled wireless channel model framework. The proposed channel model is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), including feed-forward neural network (FNN) and radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN). The input parameters are transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) coordinates, Tx-Rx distance, and carrier frequency, while the output parameters are channel statistical properties, including the received power, root mean square (RMS) delay spread (DS), and RMS angle spreads (ASs). Datasets used to train and test the ANNs are collected from both real channel measurements and a geometry based stochastic model (GBSM). Simulation results show good performance and indicate that machine learning algorithms can be powerful analytical tools for future measurement-based wireless channel modeling.","doi":"10.1109/TBDATA.2018.2884489","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Big Data","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Big Data","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687317/9098178/08561241.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9098178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBDATA.2018.2884489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Big Data Enabled Channel Model for 5G Wireless Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8561241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2020","displayDocTitle":"A Big Data Enabled Channel Model for 5G Wireless Communication Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561241/","publicationDate":"1 June 2020","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19633296","htmlLink":"/document/8561241/","volume":"6","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1801101 and YFB0102104"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61960206006, 61901109, 61771293, 61932014 and 61572323"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012152","fundingName":"National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents","grantNumber":"BX20180062"},{"fundingName":"High Level Innovation and Entrepreneurial Talent Introduction Program in Jiangsu"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Southeast University","grantNumber":"2020B01"},{"fundingName":"EU H2020 RISE TESTBED2 project","grantNumber":"872172"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2242019R30001"},{"fundingName":"Huawei Cooperation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003399","fundingName":"Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality","grantNumber":"18511106500"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"319484"},{"fundingName":"JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Big Data Enabled Channel Model for 5G Wireless Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tbdata-huang-2884489-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144154S","chronDate":"June 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"6687317","isNumber":"9098178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687317","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"9098178","articleId":"8561241","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8561242,"authors":[{"name":"Sahar Yousefi","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran","Division of Image Processing, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/8926550/8561242/youse-2885211-small.gif","p":["Sahar Yousefi is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in artificial intelligence at the Sharif University of Technology, Iran.

While the previous approaches can produce good results, the accurate detection of motion remains a challenging task due to the difficulties raised by illumination variations, occlusion, camouflage, sudden motions appearing in burst, dynamic texture, and environmental changes such as weather conditions, sunlight changes during a day, and so on. In this paper, a novel per-pixel motion descriptor is proposed for motion detection in video sequences which outperforms the current methods in the literature particularly in severe scenarios. The proposed descriptor is based on two complementary three-dimensional discrete wavelet transforms (3D-DWT) and a 3D wavelet leader. In this approach, a feature vector is extracted for each pixel by applying a novel 3D wavelet-based motion descriptor. Then, the extracted features are clustered by the well-known K-means algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art approaches in several public benchmark datasets. The application of the proposed method and additional experimental results for several challenging datasets are available online.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/8926550/08561242.pdf","startPage":"3487","endPage":"3500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2018.2885211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2018.2885211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8926550","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8561242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Motion Detection Method Using 3D Discrete Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion detection","Feature extraction","Dynamics","Video sequences","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","feature extraction","image sequences","image texture","motion estimation","object detection","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["K-means algorithm","3D wavelet-based motion descriptor","surveillance systems","video analysis","motion detection method","3D wavelet leader","three-dimensional discrete wavelet transforms","video sequences","per-pixel motion descriptor","sunlight changes","environmental changes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Motion detection","dynamic texture","3D-discrete wavelet transform","wavelet leader"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Motion Detection Method Using 3D Discrete Wavelet Transform","volume":"29","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8561242/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19309511","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Motion Detection Method Using 3D Discrete Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-yousefi-2885211-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124862S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"8926550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8926550","articleId":"8561242","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8561244,"authors":[{"name":"Hongjun Su","affiliation":["School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Hohai University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/8602368/8561244/su-2880749-small.gif","p":["Hongjun Su (S\u201909\u2013M\u201911\u2013SM\u201918) received the B.S. degree in geography information system from the China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China, and the Ph.D. degree in cartography and geography information system from the Key Laboratory of Virtual Geographic Environment (Ministry of Education), Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.","He was a Visiting Student with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA, from 2009 to 2010.

For the original CRD, the least squares solution becomes more unstable when more classes, i.e., samples for anomaly detection are involved, and the detection error is likely to happen if the test pixel is an anomalous pixel and several samples from background are similar anomalous. In this paper, we propose a hyperspectral anomaly detection method that uses CRD with principal component analysis (PCA) for removing outlier (PCAroCRD). According to the different background modeling methods, global and local versions are proposed. In the proposed algorithm, the spatial-domain PCA is adopted to extract main pixel information of global/local background that will be used as samples for collaborative representation, and simultaneously the information of abnormal pixels in global/local background can be removed. Fewer useful samples can also keep the detection result stable. Experimental results indicate that the PCAroCRD outperforms the original CRD, kernel version of CRD, advanced CRD (CRDBORAD), morphology-based CRD, Global Reed-Xiaoli (RX) algorithm, and the Local RX.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8602368","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/8602368/08561244.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2880749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2880749","startPage":"5029","endPage":"5038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection Using Collaborative Representation With Outlier Removal","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561244/","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection Using Collaborative Representation With Outlier Removal","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8561244/","volume":"11","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"18360064","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2019","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41571325 and 41871220"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2018B17914"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20181312"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection Using Collaborative Representation With Outlier Removal","sourcePdf":"jstars-su-2880749-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.211981S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"8602368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8602368","articleId":"8561244","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8561251,"authors":[{"name":"Kamala Raghavan Sadagopan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8580626/8561251/sadag-2875465-small.gif","p":["Kamala Raghavan Sadagopan (S\u201915) received the B.Tech and M.Tech degrees in electrical engineering from IIT Madras, Chennai, India, in 2015.

In this paper, a DMC system in biological cylindrical environment is considered, inspired by blood vessel structures in the body. The internal surface of the cylinder boundary is assumed to be covered by the biological receptors which may irreversibly react with hitting molecules. Also, the information molecules diffusing in the fluid medium are subject to a degradation reaction and flow. The concentration Green\u2019s function of diffusion in this environment is analytically derived which takes into account asymmetry in all radial, axial, and azimuthal coordinates. Employing obtained Green\u2019s function, information channel between transmitter and transparent receiver of DMC is characterized. To evaluate the DMC system in the biological cylinder, a simple on-off keying modulation scheme is adopted and corresponding error probability is derived. The particle-based simulation results confirm the proposed analysis. Also, the effect of different system parameters on the concentration Green\u2019s function are examined.

For power-efficient ICL design, optimization of the utilized physical inductor geometries is essential, but currently must be performed manually in a process that can take several hours. As a result, the generation of optimized inductor designs poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we address this challenge in three main contributions: 1) a novel, nonuniform planar inductor layout that exhibits enhanced performance when compared with conventional uniform inductors; 2) a rapid solver for evaluating inductor layouts; and 3) a high-speed optimization algorithm for determining best performing coil pairs. These three contributions are combined as a CAD tool for optimization of ICLs for 3-D-ICs (COIL-3-D). Results demonstrate that COIL-3-D achieves an average accuracy within 7.8% of finite-element tools consuming a small fraction of the time (1.5 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n %), significantly ameliorating the design of ICL-based 3-D-ICs. We also demonstrate that using COIL-3-D to optimize ICL inductor layouts can yield significant performance (up to 41.5% bandwidth improvement) and power (up to 8.1% power improvement) benefits, when compared with layouts used in prior ICL implementations. For these reasons, this paper unlocks new potential for low-cost, power-efficient 3-D integration using ICLs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561260/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","volume":"27","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"18486049","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8561260/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and Optimization of Inductive-Coupling Links for 3-D-ICs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Optimization of Inductive-Coupling Links for 3-D-ICs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-fletcher-2881075-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125859S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8649697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8649697","articleId":"8561260","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8561264,"authors":[{"name":"Shanmuganathan Thananjeyan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8561264/thana-2885119-small.gif","p":["Shanmuganathan Thananjeyan (M\u201918) received the B.Sc. degree in electronic and telecommunication engineering and the M.B.A. degree in information technology from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, in 2009 and 2014, respectively.

The user experience can be enhanced beyond the constrained resources limited by the user equipment by offloading computation-intensive tasks to the mobile edge (ME) hosts. However, ensuring service continuity of the offloaded tasks while users are moving from cell to cell is a critical factor to be kept in mind before selecting the locations suitable for ME host deployment. Therefore, in this paper, we present an optimization model to address the resource distribution problem of mobile users in an ME system so that the total number of tasks accomplished is maximized by considering the user mobility patterns in the network. Despite the fact that the correlation of human mobility during peak hours is present in the traces of urban cities, there is a lack of a correlated human mobility model in the existing literature. We first developed a synthetic correlated mobility model to reproduce the human traces of mobility during morning peak hours. We then developed a utilitarian resource distribution algorithm to solve the ME host deployment and the resource distribution problem. We anticipate that the findings of this paper will contribute to the development of a real-time network management and monitoring system in the ME system to detect changes in MEC resource requirements and optimize MEC resource orchestration based on the predicted user mobility and services\u2019 usage demands. Our proposed methods will: 1) become a critical part of the future network management system of 5G that employs MEC; 2) contribute to the standardization of the MEC and 5G platforms; and 3) help network operators reduce the massive cost of deploying and operating a large number of distributed servers in the next-generation mobile networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deployment and Resource Distribution of Mobile Edge Hosts Based on Correlated User Mobility","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885119","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08561264.pdf","startPage":"148","endPage":"159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8561264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561264/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Deployment and Resource Distribution of Mobile Edge Hosts Based on Correlated User Mobility","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8561264/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Deployment and Resource Distribution of Mobile Edge Hosts Based on Correlated User Mobility","sourcePdf":"access-shanmuganathan-2885119-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063921S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8561264","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8561272,"authors":[{"name":"Zongwei Zhu","affiliation":["Suzhou Institute for Advanced Study, University of Science and Technology of China, Suzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8561272/zhu-2885064-small.gif","p":["Zongwei Zhu received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

Most mobile devices consume considerable power in the standby mode, during which the capacitive DRAM cells' self-refresh power, which is used to preserve data integrity, accounts for a large part. To address this issue, strategies from both hardware and software perspectives have been proposed, and yet, the existing hardware methods usually have a high cost. Software strategies mainly focus on the operating system page allocation strategy to maximize resource idleness. The partial array self-refresh technique has been proposed to allow for some of the DRAM cells to retain the self-refresh state while shutting down the others. Using this technique, numerous studies extend the unused DRAM idle time by clustering the applications' data but do not discuss the impact of the address mapping mechanism on power consumption. However, this impact was proven to be essential in our previous study. In this paper, we attempt to investigate the impacts of different memory mapping schemes on different clustering strategies using a hierarchy-based memory management system (HBMM) and provide insights for selecting the optimal schemes. The experimental results on the Android platform demonstrate that the schemes and strategies are closely correlated, and memory idle time can be prolonged 125 times with their suitable combination. Conversely, the worst scheme may decrease memory idleness by 12% compared with the original system. Furthermore, our studies on a physical platform show that standby power consumption can be saved by 23% when using HBMM combined with the best clustering strategy.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08561272.pdf","startPage":"78513","endPage":"78520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8561272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impacts of Memory Address Mapping Scheme on Reducing DRAM Self-Refresh Power for Mobile Computing Devices","topic":"Mobile Service Computing with Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561272/","displayDocTitle":"Impacts of Memory Address Mapping Scheme on Reducing DRAM Self-Refresh Power for Mobile Computing Devices","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8561272/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18621984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Impacts of Memory Address Mapping Scheme on Reducing DRAM Self-Refresh Power for Mobile Computing Devices","sourcePdf":"access-cao-2885064-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086033S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Mobile Service Computing with Internet of Things"],"articleId":"8561272","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8561281,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Bing Zeng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University of Technology, Zhuzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8561281/zeng-2885059-small.gif","p":["Hong-Bing Zeng received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Tianjin University of Technology and Education, Tianjin, China, in 2003, the M.Sc. degree in computer science from the Central South University of Forestry, Changsha, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Central South University, Changsha, in 2012.

Collecting and examining the sentiment conveyed through these tweets will help to draw a complete picture which expresses fan interaction during a specific football event. The objective of this work is to propose a domain-specific approach for understanding sentiments expressed in football fans' conversations. To achieve our goal, we start by developing a football-specific sentiment dataset which we label manually. We then utilize our dataset to automatically create a football-specific sentiment lexicon. Finally, we develop a sentiment classifier which is capable of recognizing sentiments expressed in football conversation. We conduct extensive experiments on our dataset to compare the performance of different learning algorithms in identifying the sentiment expressed in football related tweets. Our results show that our approach is effective in recognizing the fans' sentiment during football events.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885117","startPage":"78609","endPage":"78621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08561283.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sentiment Identification in Football-Specific Tweets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561283/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sentiment Identification in Football-Specific Tweets","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8561283/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18586069","publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Sentiment Identification in Football-Specific Tweets","sourcePdf":"access-aloufi-2885117-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111966S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8561283","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8561294,"authors":[{"name":"Ao Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Terahertz and Millimeter Wave, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8561294/ali-2884946-small.gif","p":["Ao Li was born in Sichuan, China, in 1993.

Based on the substrate integrated waveguide structure, two kinds of ME-dipole are placed closely by sharing the same metallic post wall between them, achieving an element space of 0.77\u03bb0. Besides, mutual coupling between the close elements is numerically analyzed and then suppressed by making modifications to the antenna structure. The proposed dual-polarized element achieves bandwidths of 26% and 32% (|S11| <; -14 dB) for the V-pol and H-pol, respectively. A 1\u00d78 element array is designed, fabricated, and measured. Good agreement is achieved between the measurement and simulation. For the V-pol excitation, a bandwidth of 21% is obtained and gain is up to 16.1 dB. For the H-pol excitation, the bandwidth is 18% and peak gain is 15.1 dB. Radiation patterns are stable over the operating frequencies with cross polarizations below -30 dB for both polarizations. The port isolation is very high above 45 dB. With all these advantages of dual polarization, end-fire radiation, stable gain, and high port isolation, the proposed array is a potential candidate for the future 5G applications.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2884946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2884946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08561294.pdf","startPage":"78276","endPage":"78285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dual Linearly Polarized End-Fire Antenna Array for the 5G Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Dual Linearly Polarized End-Fire Antenna Array for the 5G Applications","volume":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8561294/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18621988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561294/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grant Council of Hong Kong, China","grantNumber":"9042377 (CityU 11277116)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Dual Linearly Polarized End-Fire Antenna Array for the 5G Applications","sourcePdf":"access-li-2884946-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081734S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8561294","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8561327,"authors":[{"name":"Marek Florkowski","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Florkowski","id":"37299909300"},{"name":"Barbara Florkowska","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Power Engineering, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"Florkowska","id":"37276053600"},{"name":"Maciej Kuniewski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Power Engineering, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Kuniewski","id":"37085390192"},{"name":"Pawel Zydron","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Power Engineering, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"firstName":"Pawel","lastName":"Zydron","id":"37300377400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9878"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4135"}],"articleNumber":"8561327","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":569},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation Society","url":"http://tdei.sju.edu/deis/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial discharges","Discharges (electric)","Conductivity","Surface discharges","Surface morphology","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ageing","discharges (electric)","partial discharge measurement","partial discharges","surface resistance","voids (solid)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long term PD exposure","discharges","void wall","clustering effect","dispersed channels","reduced resistivity","discharge spots","surface resistivity","effective discharge area","void source","PD pattern modulation","cross channels","complete discharge","discharge channels","effective partial discharge area","partial discharge dynamics","dielectric structure","multichannel discharges","aging tests"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["partial discharge mechanism","discharge channels distribution","void surface conductivity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8561327","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2018.007426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","abstract":"This paper describes a novel approach to understanding partial discharge (PD) dynamics and mapping of the discharge channels in a void. During long term PD exposure, discharges develop inside channels within a void, leading to a variation in the discharge area on the void wall as well as a clustering effect. In this paper, the development of a method for identifying localized changes in the dielectric structure, through the detection of dispersed channels with reduced resistivity which occur due to multichannel discharges, is described. Discharge spots in selected ranges of surface resistivity, occurring due to the energetic impact of PD, are mapped. This mapping shows both the distribution of local centers on the surface of the specimen, characterized by a reduced value of surface resistivity. Furthermore, during aging tests this surface resistivity exhibited a progressive reduction by four orders of magnitude, justifying the occurrence of an effective discharge area in the void source. This additionally impacts PD pattern modulation and can be a possible initiation of the formation of cross channels in the bulk isolation which, in the long term, can lead to complete discharge.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2018.007426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8561300","startPage":"2220","endPage":"2228","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/94/8561300/08561327.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping of discharge channels in void creating effective partial discharge area","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561327/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8561327/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mapping of discharge channels in void creating effective partial discharge area","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18341563","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping of discharge channels in void creating effective partial discharge area","sourcePdf":"p2220florkowski.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117871S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"8561300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8561300","articleId":"8561327","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8561345,"authors":[{"name":"Xudong Li","affiliation":["Chongqing University, State Key Laboratory of Power Equipment & System Security and New Technology, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/8561300/8561345/8561345-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xudong Li received the Bachelor degree in electrical engineering in 2013, from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China.

The creeping discharge behavior at various voltage levels to failure were analyzed using partial discharge (PD) measurements, camera observations, and electric field simulations. It was found that the creeping discharge distribution was significantly influenced by the DC component, and it was difficult to induce failure even on OIP with high moisture under combined AC and DC voltage. The flashover along the free-oil boundary layer above the OIP during creeping discharge occurred much more easily under combined AC and DC than under AC voltage, and the quality of the oil was important to avoid flashover. These differences were attributed to the combined influence of the electric field distribution under DC and space charge accumulation.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2018.007233","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/94/8561300/08561345.pdf","startPage":"2380","endPage":"2388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2018.007233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8561300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of creeping discharges on oil-impregnated pressboard under combined AC and DC voltages","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8561345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8561345/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of creeping discharges on oil-impregnated pressboard under combined AC and DC voltages","volume":"25","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18341592","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8561345/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of creeping discharges on oil-impregnated pressboard under combined AC and DC voltages","sourcePdf":"p2380li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091899S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"8561300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8561300","articleId":"8561345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8561351,"authors":[{"name":"Maximilian Streibl","affiliation":["CT REE MDM FMP-DE, Siemens AG, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Maximilian Streibl was born in Bayreuth, Germany in 1991.

This DAC effectively combines an infinite impulse response filter with a switched capacitor resistor DAC (SCR-DAC). The resulting DAC is inherently immune toward inter-symbol interference. Moreover, by filtering the feedback signal in the discrete-time domain, the jitter robustness of the modulator is greatly improved and most importantly the slewing requirements on the OpAmps in the modulator's loop filter are greatly relaxed up to a level that the OpAmps can be scaled down toward their ultimate noise limited power level. Furthermore, this LPSC-DAC does not suffer from the SCR-DAC's disadvantageous trade-off between the modulator's jitter, slewing, and anti-aliasing performance. We also show how to compensate for the extra pole of the LPSC-DAC, such that the CTSDM's loop filter, noise- and signal-transfer function remains unchanged. As a result, this technique is completely transparent to the system level designer and established system-level design techniques for sigma delta modulators remain applicable.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2018.2882746","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8667917/08563045.pdf","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8667917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2018.2882746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Pass Filtering SC-DAC for Reduced Jitter and Slewing Requirements on CTSDMs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","displayDocTitle":"Low-Pass Filtering SC-DAC for Reduced Jitter and Slewing Requirements on CTSDMs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563045/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"April 2019","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18528033","htmlLink":"/document/8563045/","volume":"66","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003130","fundingName":"Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Low-Pass Filtering SC-DAC for Reduced Jitter and Slewing Requirements on CTSDMs","sourcePdf":"tcsi-vercaemer-2882746-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113426S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8667917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8667917","articleId":"8563045","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8563048,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiu-Chen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8667917/8563048/chang-2882770-small.gif","p":["Hsiu-Chen Chang (S\u201918) received the M.Sc. degree in electro-optical engineering from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2009.

One of the major problems to be considered is inter-carrier interference (ICI) that is generated by Doppler-spread under mobile reception of MIMO-OFDM systems. In this case, reception characteristics are deteriorated significantly. The ICI canceller for MIMO-OFDM can demodulate transmitted symbols. To realize the MIMO-ICI canceller based on zero-forcing (ZF), it is necessary to reduce the complex calculations such as matrix operations. Therefore, complexity reduction of the MIMO-ICI canceller is proposed. The proposed MIMO-ICI canceller with complexity reduction based on ZF can improve the influence of ICI with low complexity. However, reception characteristics are deteriorated as compared to the MIMO-ICI canceller based on ZF. Thus, improving scheme of MIMO-ICI canceller with complexity reduction based on ZF is proposed. In the proposed scheme, the iterative detection is adopted. In addition, MIMO-ICI cancellers based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) are proposed. As the results of computer simulations, the MIMO-ICI cancellers using iterative detection based on ZF and MMSE can improve the reception characteristics with low complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study on Dual-Polarized MIMO-ICI Canceller With Complexity Reduction Under Mobile Reception of OFDM Signals","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2018.2882784","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/8824235/08563051.pdf","startPage":"589","endPage":"600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2018.2882784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8824235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563051","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563051/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","displayDocTitle":"A Study on Dual-Polarized MIMO-ICI Canceller With Complexity Reduction Under Mobile Reception of OFDM Signals","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8563051/","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2019","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18954361","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009105","fundingName":"Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","grantNumber":"15K18069"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study on Dual-Polarized MIMO-ICI Canceller With Complexity Reduction Under Mobile Reception of OFDM Signals","sourcePdf":"tbc-nakamura-2882784-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076761S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"8824235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","xplore-issue":"8824235","articleId":"8563051","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8563052,"authors":[{"name":"Arzu Ergintav","affiliation":["IHP, Frankfurt (Oder), Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8691851/8563052/ergin-2880881-small.gif","p":["Arzu Ergintav (M\u201916) received the M.S. degree in biomedical engineering from Bogazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2002.","From 2000 to 2004, she was a Design Engineer at the Istanbul Design Center of Cypress Semiconductors, where she was involved in the design of CMOS ASICs, specifically frequency generator chips.

The phase noise spectrum under modulation is analytically calculated for a second-order charge pump PLL with a feedback divider ratio linearly changing over time. This is followed by an analysis of the steady-state rms frequency error of the output frequency after PLL settling is achieved during chirp generation. A fractional-N PLL with integrated frequency ramp generator is presented. Phase noise and jitter measurements on the PLL under modulation are performed at the output of the programmable feedback divider. The resulting low-frequency rms jitter is reduced by about 9dB with doubling the charge pump current, and reduced by about 6dB with halving the ramp slope. The rms frequency error under FMCW modulation is measured at the modulated voltage-controlled oscillator output. The dependence of the frequency error on the loop filter capacitance for various ramp slopes is given. A frequency error of 112kHz is achieved with a ramp slope of 1.28GHz/80 \u03bcs at a carrier frequency of 62GHz. The noise measurements are in good agreement with the developed phase noise model. A programmable loop filter capacitance is suggested to accommodate the static phase offset and the resulting noise performance to the ramp slope.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2018.2880881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8691851/08563052.pdf","startPage":"1670","endPage":"1680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8691851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2018.2880881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study of Phase Noise and Frequency Error of a Fractional-N PLL in the Course of FMCW Chirp Generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","displayDocTitle":"A Study of Phase Noise and Frequency Error of a Fractional-N PLL in the Course of FMCW Chirp Generation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563052/","publicationDate":"May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18613289","htmlLink":"/document/8563052/","volume":"66","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Phase Noise and Frequency Error of a Fractional-N PLL in the Course of FMCW Chirp Generation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ergintav-2880881-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103941S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8691851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8691851","articleId":"8563052","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8563103,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8784422/8563103/yang-2883262-small.gif","p":["Jie Yang was born in She County, Hebei, China.

Therefore, demand forecasting is very important for the operation of the smelting process. However, it is difficult to forecast demand since the power changes depend on the smelting process and raw materials. To obtain an accurate model, the mechanism model of the smelting process is combined with the data-driven method using artificial intelligence technology in this paper. The mechanism model is described by a linear model with unknown parameters. The uncertainties and error of the mechanism model are modeled by neural networks with unknown order. The maximal information coefficient method and the rule reasoning are combined to identify the order. To effectively combine the mechanism model and the data-driven model, a new saturated alternating identification strategy is proposed. The results of simulations and industrial applications show that the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent method of demand forecasting has been validated.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8784422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2018.2883262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8784422/08563103.pdf","startPage":"9745","endPage":"9755","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2018.2883262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Demand Forecasting of Smelting Process Using Data-Driven and Mechanism Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Demand Forecasting of Smelting Process Using Data-Driven and Mechanism Model","volume":"66","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8563103/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"18881959","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563103/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA043802"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Demand Forecasting of Smelting Process Using Data-Driven and Mechanism Model","sourcePdf":"tie-yang-2883262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118725S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8784422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8784422","articleId":"8563103","onlineDate":"05 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8563104,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Sami Mohammed","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8703752/8563104/moham-2881935-small.gif","p":["Mohammed Sami Mohammed was born in Diyala, Iraq, in 1980.

In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach to address this problem. First, to detect text instances of different scales, a feature pyramid network is adopted as a backbone network to extract three feature maps of different scales from a given input image, where a scale-specific detection module is attached to each feature map. Then, for a pixel on each feature map, a detection module is used to predict whether there exists a text instance at its corresponding location in the input image. For positive prediction, the bounding box of the detected text segment and the links between the concerned pixel and its 8 neighbors on the feature map are predicted simultaneously. Based on the linkage information, text segments extracted from each feature map are grouped into text-lines respectively and wrongly grouped text-lines are separated by a graph-based text-line segmentation method. Finally, detection results from three different feature maps are aggregated by a skewed non-maximum suppression algorithm. Our proposed approach has achieved superior results on a testing set consisting of 285 natural scene images of whiteboards and handwritten notes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug 2018","accessionNumber":"18343799","htmlLink":"/document/8563217/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A CNN-Based Approach to Detecting Text from Images of Whiteboards and Handwritten Notes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CNN-Based Approach to Detecting Text from Images of Whiteboards and Handwritten Notes","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"587500a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106629S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8563039","isNumber":"8563207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8563039","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8563207","articleId":"8563217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8563221,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas K\u00f6lsch","affiliation":["Insiders Technologies GmbH, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"K\u00f6lsch","id":"37086297630"},{"name":"Ashutosh Mishra","affiliation":["MindGarage, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Ashutosh","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37086554693"},{"name":"Saurabh Varshneya","affiliation":["Insiders Technologies GmbH, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Varshneya","id":"37086561623"},{"name":"Muhammad Zeshan Afzal","affiliation":["Insiders Technologies GmbH, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Muhammad Zeshan","lastName":"Afzal","id":"38184773600"},{"name":"Marcus Liwicki","affiliation":["Lule\u00e5, University of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Marcus","lastName":"Liwicki","id":"37670661800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5875-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5876-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8563221","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563221","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Task analysis","Feature extraction","Semantics","Training","Layout","Handwriting recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","document image processing","handwriting recognition","handwritten character recognition","image annotation","image classification","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pixel classification","data augmentation","fully convolutional neural network based methods","German documents","handwritten annotations recognition","end-to-end semantic segmentation approaches"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Segmentation","Deep Learning","Annotation Detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICFHR-2018.2018.00014","pdfPath":"/iel7/8563039/8563207/08563221.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR)","startPage":"25","endPage":"31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8563207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR-2018.2018.00014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognizing Challenging Handwritten Annotations with Fully Convolutional Networks","abstract":"This paper introduces a very challenging dataset of historic German documents and evaluates Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) based methods to locate handwritten annotations of any kind in these documents.

We perform a detailed ablation study to analyze the contribution of individual modules and present state of art results for the task of unconstrained line and word recognition on popular datasets such as IAM, RIMES and GW.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Aug 2018","accessionNumber":"18343788","htmlLink":"/document/8563230/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improving CNN-RNN Hybrid Networks for Handwriting Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving CNN-RNN Hybrid Networks for Handwriting Recognition","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"587500a080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101979S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8563039","isNumber":"8563207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8563039","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8563207","articleId":"8563230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8563231,"authors":[{"name":"Felipe Petroski Such","affiliation":["Rochester Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Felipe Petroski","lastName":"Such","id":"37086124838"},{"name":"Dheeraj Peri","affiliation":["Rochester Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Dheeraj","lastName":"Peri","id":"37086346110"},{"name":"Frank Brockler","affiliation":["Kodak Alaris, USA"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Brockler","id":"37086563288"},{"name":"Hutkowski Paul","affiliation":["Kodak Alaris, UK"],"firstName":"Hutkowski","lastName":"Paul","id":"37087705994"},{"name":"Raymond Ptucha","affiliation":["Rochester Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Raymond","lastName":"Ptucha","id":"37586946900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5875-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5876-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8563231","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vocabulary","Dictionaries","Handwriting recognition","Character recognition","Image segmentation","Optical character recognition software","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten character recognition","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","probability","text detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully convolutional handwriting model","dual stream architecture","heavy preprocessing steps","symbol alignment correction","complex post processing steps","connectionist temporal classification","dictionary matching","Latin-based languages","attention based mechanism","fully convolutional networks","handwritten text recognition","errant word blocks","probabilistic character error rate","IAM datasets","RIMES datasets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fully Convolutional Neural Networks, Handwriting Recognition, Deep Learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563231","abstract":"Handwritten text recognition is challenging because of the virtually infinite ways a human can write the same message. Our fully convolutional handwriting model takes in a handwriting sample of unknown length and outputs an arbitrary stream of symbols. Our dual stream architecture uses both local and global context and mitigates the need for heavy preprocessing steps such as symbol alignment correction as well as complex post processing steps such as connectionist temporal classification, dictionary matching or language models. Using over 100 unique symbols, our model is agnostic to Latin-based languages, and is shown to be quite competitive with state of the art dictionary based methods on the popular IAM and RIMES datasets. When a dictionary is known, we further allow a probabilistic character error rate to correct errant word blocks. Finally, we introduce an attention based mechanism which can automatically target variants of handwriting, such as slant, stroke width, or noise.","doi":"10.1109/ICFHR-2018.2018.00024","startPage":"86","endPage":"91","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR-2018.2018.00024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8563207","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8563039/8563207/08563231.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully Convolutional Networks for Handwriting Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563231/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fully Convolutional Networks for Handwriting Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8563231/","accessionNumber":"18343798","publicationDate":"Aug 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully Convolutional Networks for Handwriting Recognition","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"587500a086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068112S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8563039","isNumber":"8563207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8563039","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8563207","articleId":"8563231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8563232,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Kenji Iwana","affiliation":["Department of Advanced Information Technology, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Brian Kenji","lastName":"Iwana","id":"37085754002"},{"name":"Minoru Mori","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Sciences, Kanagawa Institute of Technology, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Mori","id":"37086563735"},{"name":"Akisato Kimura","affiliation":["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akisato","lastName":"Kimura","id":"37086557657"},{"name":"Seiichi Uchida","affiliation":["Department of Advanced Information Technology, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Seiichi","lastName":"Uchida","id":"37271040200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5875-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5876-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8563232","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introducing Local Distance-Based Features to Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8563039/8563207/08563232.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"97","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR-2018.2018.00025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8563207","doi":"10.1109/ICFHR-2018.2018.00025","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time series analysis","Prototypes","Convolution","Feature extraction","Two dimensional displays","Measurement","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","feature extraction","handwritten character recognition","image classification","image matching","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local distance-based features","temporal convolutional neural networks","time series patterns","dynamically matched sequence elements","DTW features","dynamic time warping","robust distance metric","scalar distance metric","isolated handwritten digit classification","isolated handwritten character classification","Unipen online handwritten character datasets","multimodal fusion networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional Neural Networks","Time series classification","Dynamic Time Warping","Multi modal fusion networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563232","abstract":"In this paper, we propose the use of local distance-based features determined by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

This paper proposes recovering these local distances, or DTW features, and utilizing them for the input of a CNN. We demonstrate that these features can provide additional information for the classification of isolated handwritten digits and characters.

However, DNNs suffer from large consumption of computation and storage resources, which may cause problems for service providers, such as server pressure, longer service latency and higher energy consumption. To solve these problems, we propose a framework that combines singular value decomposition (SVD) and adaptive drop weight (ADW) to accelerate and compress LSTM based models. We first build an LSTM based model that achieves an accuracy of 97.83% on the ICDAR2013 online HCCR competition dataset. After restructuring the model with SVD and ADW, it can reduce the FLOPs (floating point operations per second) of the forward process by approximately 10 times and compress the model with 1/30 of the original size with only a 0.5% decrease in accuracy. Finally, integrated with our efficient forward implementation, the recognition of an online character requires only 2.7 ms in average on a CPU with a single thread, while requiring only 0.45 MB for model storage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug 2018","accessionNumber":"18343781","htmlLink":"/document/8563235/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Accelerating and Compressing LSTM Based Model for Online Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating and Compressing LSTM Based Model for Online Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"587500a110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126517S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8563039","isNumber":"8563207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8563039","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8563207","articleId":"8563235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8563237,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Jenckel","affiliation":["DFKI, University of Kaiserslautern"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Jenckel","id":"37086080010"},{"name":"Saqib Syed Bukhari","affiliation":["DFKI"],"firstName":"Saqib Syed","lastName":"Bukhari","id":"37590053400"},{"name":"Andreas Dengel","affiliation":["DFKI, University of Kaiserslautern"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Dengel","id":"37330869800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5875-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5876-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8563237","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transcription Free LSTM OCR Model Evaluation","abstract":"In recent years there has been significant progress in the field of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), mainly due to the use of various LSTM-based architectures. In the classic supervised training setup for LSTM-based OCR, the available image data and corresponding transcription is split into a training, a validation and a test set. Especially in the context of historical documents generating these transcriptions can be very costly, therefore minimizing the required transcribed data or maximizing the size of the training set to generate better models are desirable. We propose a novel method to evaluate LSTM OCR-models without requiring transcription ground truth data. For this we employ a second LSTM in an encoder-decoder setup to recreate the image data from the OCR output and evaluate the model based on its difference to the original input. We show that this approach performs similar to traditional transcription based evaluation on a historical document from the 16th century.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical character recognition software","Training","Decoding","Data models","Measurement","Computational modeling","Labeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","optical character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transcription ground truth data","encoder-decoder setup","historical document","transcription free LSTM OCR model evaluation","classic supervised training setup","optical character recognition","image data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OCR","LSTM","Evaluation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563237","doi":"10.1109/ICFHR-2018.2018.00030","startPage":"122","endPage":"126","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8563039/8563207/08563237.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8563207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR-2018.2018.00030","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563237/","displayDocTitle":"Transcription Free LSTM OCR Model Evaluation","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18343792","htmlLink":"/document/8563237/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transcription Free LSTM OCR Model Evaluation","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"587500a122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058712S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8563039","isNumber":"8563207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8563039","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8563207","articleId":"8563237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8563238,"authors":[{"name":"Dayvid Castro","affiliation":["Polytechnic School of Pernambuco, University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Dayvid","lastName":"Castro","id":"37086557387"},{"name":"Byron L.

The system was evaluated with English handwritten text lines from the IAM database and the experiments demonstrated that the proposed MDLSTM architecture was able to maintain a robust recognition performance (around 3.6% CER and 10.5% WER) and present significant speedups, approximately 48% and 32% faster than the state-of-the-art MDLSTM optical model, regarding the learning and classification times, respectively.

Experimental results on large scale English HWR and OCR tasks show that the learned small student model can achieve about 14.6x footprint reduction and 9.6x speedup without recognition accuracy degradation against the big teacher model.","doi":"10.1109/ICFHR-2018.2018.00033","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8563039/8563207/08563240.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8563207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR-2018.2018.00033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building Compact CNN-DBLSTM Based Character Models for Handwriting Recognition and OCR by Teacher-Student Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Building Compact CNN-DBLSTM Based Character Models for Handwriting Recognition and OCR by Teacher-Student Learning","htmlLink":"/document/8563240/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Aug 2018","accessionNumber":"18343776","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building Compact CNN-DBLSTM Based Character Models for Handwriting Recognition and OCR by Teacher-Student Learning","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"587500a139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098956S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8563039","isNumber":"8563207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8563039","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8563207","articleId":"8563240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8563282,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangyu Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xiangyu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086423445"},{"name":"Junhao Shi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Junhao","lastName":"Shi","id":"37086451891"},{"name":"Dan Feng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Feng","id":"37085842912"},{"name":"Huiqing Zhai","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Huiqing","lastName":"Zhai","id":"37540036000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2416-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2415-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2417-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8563282","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":431},"abstract":"A low-profile dual-polarized MIMO antenna array with high isolation is proposed in this paper.

Millimeter wave has been widely used in vehicle radar because of its advantages of high resolution, low interception probability, small size of antenna components and strong anti-interference ability. In the traditional signal processing scheme, the sampling frequency must be greater than two times the maximum frequency of the signal due to the limitation of the sampling theorem. Because the working frequency of vehicular radar is relatively high, which brings challenges and difficulties to sampling devices and data storage devices, and the compressed sensing method can recover data based on a small number of data sampling values. This paper analyzes the principle of velocity measurement and ranging for triangular wave modulated FMCW radar, introduces the concepts of compressed sensing, and uses the method of compressed sensing to simulate the radar ranging, and achieves good results.","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2018.8563360","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540789/8563258/08563360.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2018.8563360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8563258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Compressed Sensing in Vehicular LFMCW Millimeter Wave Radar Ranging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 May 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563360/","displayDocTitle":"Application of Compressed Sensing in Vehicular LFMCW Millimeter Wave Radar Ranging","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18321450","htmlLink":"/document/8563360/","conferenceDate":"7-11 May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Compressed Sensing in Vehicular LFMCW Millimeter Wave Radar Ranging","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"TP2F_04_214_3_0.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028123S","chronDate":"7-11 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540789","isNumber":"8563258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540789","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8563258","articleId":"8563360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8563361,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Lv","affiliation":["Ministerial Key Laboratory of JGMT, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Lv","id":"37086472756"},{"name":"Jingqi Wang","affiliation":["Ministerial Key Laboratory of JGMT, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jingqi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086473782"},{"name":"ZhiSheng Jiang","affiliation":["Ministerial Key Laboratory of JGMT, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"ZhiSheng","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086476395"},{"name":"Wen Wu","affiliation":["Ministerial Key Laboratory of JGMT, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085612467"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2416-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2415-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2417-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8563361","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"abstract":"Waveform design for joint radar-communication plays a significant role in recent years, and many approaches focus on satisfying orthogonality in time, frequency and coding separately. This paper describes a joint radar-communication system based on a new waveform, called orthogonal chirp division multiplexing in the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system (OCDM-OFDM). By introducing OCDM, which satisfies orthogonality in the chirp domain, into OFDM scheme, the new joint waveform multiplexes a bank of orthogonal chirped waveforms in orthogonal subcarriers and therefore achieves higher communication rate. Furthermore, the implementation of the joint system based on OCDM-OFDM is discussed. Simulation results show that by applying 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) for embedding communication date, the proposed joint system provides remarkable communication and radar performance simultaneously.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540789/8563258/08563361.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT)","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2018.8563361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2018.8563361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8563258","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Joint Radar-Communication System Based on OCDM-OFDM Scheme","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chirp","OFDM","Code division multiplexing","Radar","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chirp modulation","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","joint waveform multiplexes","orthogonal chirped waveforms","orthogonal subcarriers","higher communication rate","communication date","radar performance","joint radar-communication system","OCDM-OFDM scheme","waveform design","orthogonal chirp division multiplexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563361/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Joint Radar-Communication System Based on OCDM-OFDM Scheme","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8563361/","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18322006","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"7-11 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Joint Radar-Communication System Based on OCDM-OFDM Scheme","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"WA1P_31_505_3_0.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036103S","chronDate":"7-11 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540789","isNumber":"8563258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540789","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8563258","articleId":"8563361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8563373,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyu He","affiliation":["Graduate School, China Academy of Railway Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyu","lastName":"He","id":"37086415402"},{"name":"Zhijie Yang","affiliation":["Signal & Communication Research Institute, China Academy of Railway Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhijie","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086416221"},{"name":"Jingyang Lv","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingyang","lastName":"Lv","id":"37671124600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2416-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2415-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2417-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8563373","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO communication","Ultra wideband antennas","Bandwidth","Antenna radiation patterns","Antenna measurements","Mutual coupling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","microstrip antenna arrays","MIMO communication","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-notched function","triple band-notched characteristics","satellite communication","antenna performance","radiation patterns","UWB MIMO antenna","low mutual coupling","modern UWB MIMO communication system","compact multiple-input-multiple-output antenna","radiation patch","T-shaped stub","band-notched antenna","frequency 3.0 GHz to 10.5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input-multiple-output communication system","ultrawideband antenna","band-notched function","isolation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a compact multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna with a small size of 31\u00d726\u00d70.8mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n. The antenna consists of two radiation patch fed by microstrip and placed symmetrically. The T-shaped stub stretched from ground is applied to improve the isolation and to broaden the bandwidth. In order to reduce the interference from nearby band, band-notched function of the antenna is required. For achieving triple band-notched characteristics, C-shaped cutting slot and S-shaped slot on the patch are applied to provide the stop-band of WiMAX, WLAN and X-band for satellite communication. Simulation measurement is taken into optimization of the antenna performance, such as reflection coefficients, coupling between two feeding ports and radiation patterns. The results illustrate that the proposed UWB MIMO antenna has an impedance bandwidth of 3GHz-10.5GHz and low mutual coupling less than -20dB, which make it a pleasant candidate for modern UWB MIMO communication system.","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2018.8563373","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540789/8563258/08563373.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2018.8563373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8563258","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Novel Band-Notched Antenna for UWB MIMO Communication System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Novel Band-Notched Antenna for UWB MIMO Communication System","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 May 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563373/","conferenceDate":"7-11 May 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18321635","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8563373/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Novel Band-Notched Antenna for UWB MIMO Communication System","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"TP1H_03_333_2_0.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047274S","chronDate":"7-11 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540789","isNumber":"8563258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540789","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8563258","articleId":"8563373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8563383,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Matlacz","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engeneering, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Matlacz","id":"37086546853"},{"name":"Grzegorz Sarwas","affiliation":["Institute of Control and Industrial Electronics, Warsaw"],"firstName":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Sarwas","id":"37847907100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-3620-6533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-83-62065-31-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7169-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-0319"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-0262"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2326-0262"}],"articleNumber":"8563383","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Architecture","Convolutional neural networks","Training","Convolution","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network training","deep neural network architecture","CrowdNet algorithm","crowd counting","convolutional neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563383","abstract":"This paper is focused on the problem of counting people in crowd.

In this paper, we addressed the problem of losing information while changing the size of input images during training neural models.

We show that without any significant changes in a model architecture it is possible to noticeably improve IoU metric. On popular Cityscapes benchmark, our model is achieving almost 2.5% boost in the accuracy of segmentation in comparison to the widely known ERF model. Additionally, to the ability to real-time usages, we run our network on GPU comparable to NVIDIA Jetson Tx2, what let us implement our algorithm in autonomous vehicles.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methods of Enriching The Flow of Information in The Real-Time Semantic Segmentation Using Deep Neural Networks","doi":"10.23919/SPA.2018.8563422","startPage":"163","endPage":"167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SPA.2018.8563422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8563268","publicationTitle":"2018 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8541818/8563268/08563422.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Methods of Enriching The Flow of Information in The Real-Time Semantic Segmentation Using Deep Neural Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8563422/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18307948","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methods of Enriching The Flow of Information in The Real-Time Semantic Segmentation Using Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058477S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8541818","isNumber":"8563268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8541818","xplore-issue":"8563268","articleId":"8563422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Division of Signal Processing and Electronic Systems, Poznan University of Technology (DSPES PUT)","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8563423,"authors":[{"name":"Jalil Nourmohammadi-Khiarak","affiliation":["Faculty Of Electrical And Computer Engineering, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Jalil","lastName":"Nourmohammadi-Khiarak","id":"37086543900"},{"name":"Samaneh Mazaheri","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Samaneh","lastName":"Mazaheri","id":"37540603100"},{"name":"Rohollah Moosavi-Tayebi","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rohollah","lastName":"Moosavi-Tayebi","id":"37086543766"},{"name":"Hamid Noorbakhsh-Devlagh","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Engineering, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Noorbakhsh-Devlagh","id":"37086544095"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-3620-6533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-83-62065-31-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7169-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-0319"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-0262"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2326-0262"}],"articleNumber":"8563423","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":428},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Object detection","Videos","Training","Detectors","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","encoding","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image classification","image representation","object detection","unsupervised learning","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural network","deep learning models","object detection area","data processing","features extraction","convolution feature","feature detection","unsupervised feature learning techniques","object classification","object features","discriminative learning","auto encoder neural networks","object detection precision","feature representations","nonlinear data transformations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning","Object Detection","Classification","Unsupervised Feature Learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563423","abstract":"Deep learning models are widely used in object detection area, including combination of multiple non-linear data transformations. The objective is receiving brief and concise information for feature representations. Due to the high volume of processing data, object detection in videos has been faced with big challenges, such as mass calculation. To increase the object detection precision in videos, a hybrid method is proposed, in this paper. Some modifications are applied to auto encoder neural networks, for the compact and discriminative learning of object features. Furthermore, for object classification, firstly extracted features are transferred to a convolutional neural network, and after feature convolution with input pictures, they will be classified. The proposed method has two main advantages over other unsupervised feature learning techniques. Firstly, as it will be shown, features are detected with a much higher precision. Secondly, in the proposed method, the outcome is compact and additional unnecessary information is removed; while the existing unsupervised feature learning models mainly learn repeated and redundant information of the features. Experimental evaluation shows that precision of feature detection improved by 1.5% in average in compare with the state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.23919/SPA.2018.8563423","startPage":"43","endPage":"49","publicationTitle":"2018 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SPA.2018.8563423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8563268","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8541818/8563268/08563423.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object Detection utilizing Modified Auto Encoder and Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563423/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Object Detection utilizing Modified Auto Encoder and Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8563423/","accessionNumber":"18307947","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object Detection utilizing Modified Auto Encoder and Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109588S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8541818","isNumber":"8563268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8541818","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8563268","articleId":"8563423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Division of Signal Processing and Electronic Systems, Poznan University of Technology (DSPES PUT)","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8563429,"authors":[{"name":"Micha\u0142 Bednarek","affiliation":["Poznan University of Technology, Institute of Control, Robotics and Information Engineering, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Micha\u0142","lastName":"Bednarek","id":"37606363800"},{"name":"Krzysztof Walas","affiliation":["Poznan University of Technology, Institute of Control, Robotics and Information Engineering, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Walas","id":"37688621800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-3620-6533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-83-62065-31-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7169-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-0319"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-0262"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2326-0262"}],"articleNumber":"8563429","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Strain","Neural networks","Splines (mathematics)","Interpolation","Training","Task analysis","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","feedforward neural nets","image classification","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNNs","visual tasks","object classification","semantic segmentation","spatial invariance","out-of-plane rotations","convolutional neural networks","neural models","MNIST dataset","spatial transformer module","spatial transformations","deep neural networks","linear regression","in-plane rotations"]}],"abstract":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have brought us the exceptionally significant improvement in the performance of the variety of visual tasks, such as object classification, semantic segmentation or linear regression.

However, in most of the existing opportunistic beamforming schemes, only one user is scheduled for data transmission at each time slot. To serve more users simultaneously, in this paper, a novel non-orthogonal scheduling algorithm is proposed from the perspectives of perfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) and system rate maximization.

In the proposed ADSD structure, the main and auxiliary elementary power amplifier (PA) are designed to achieve optimal back-off efficiency and saturated power, respectively. In this way, the overall performance can be improved while the drawbacks caused by utilizing asymmetric devices in conventional asymmetric Doherty Power Amplifier (DPA) are overcome. To verify the proposed theory and design method, an example 3.4-3.6GHz broadband ADSD is designed and fabricated using two 30-Watt transistors. According to the measured results, the ADSD exhibits 50.6%-57.3% Drain Efficiency (DE) at 6-dB power backoff and 54%-62% at saturation over the 200MHz designed bandwidth. Moreover, when stimulated using a 100MHz, 7.5 dB PAPR LTE signal at 3.5 GHz, the fabricated ADSD exhibits 45% average efficiency and 39 dBm output power after linearization while maintaining the Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR) below -47dBc.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 May 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8563570/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18321431","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A High Efficiency Asymmetric Doherty Power Amplifier Using Symmetric Devices for 5G Application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High Efficiency Asymmetric Doherty Power Amplifier Using Symmetric Devices for 5G Application","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"TAC_02_601_9_0.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036299S","chronDate":"7-11 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540789","isNumber":"8563258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540789","xplore-issue":"8563258","articleId":"8563570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8563575,"authors":[{"name":"Shujun Li","affiliation":["Institute of Lightwave Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shujun","lastName":"Li","id":"37086411857"},{"name":"Junhong Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Lightwave Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junhong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086541193"},{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["Institute of Lightwave Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","id":"37086411603"},{"name":"Ziwei Ying","affiliation":["Institute of Lightwave Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ziwei","lastName":"Ying","id":"37086412376"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2416-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2415-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2417-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8563575","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"abstract":"A compact three-band multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna is developed.

A low complexity hybrid precoder and combiner is derived based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) method, which divides the analog precoder and analog combiner design into two stages. In the first stage, analog precoder matrix is derived by employing the MMSE method on the basis of the channel knowledge. Then analog combiner can be derived based on the MMSE criterion to maximize the array gain. Finally, a low-resolution digital precoder can be obtained by using the MMSE method as well. The proposed scheme suggests only phase control over analog precoder and combiner, since both of them are carried out by using analog phase shifters. Moreover, the proposed method requires neither iterative algorithms nor optimization methods. The simulation results show that the proposed hybrid precoding/combining outperforms the existing works in terms of the realized spectral efficiency. Moreover, it provides us a solution with low complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2018.8563639","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540789/8563258/08563639.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2018.8563639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8563258","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Multi-User MIMO Hybrid Precoding Design in Millimeter Wave Cellular Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Multi-User MIMO Hybrid Precoding Design in Millimeter Wave Cellular Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 May 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563639/","conferenceDate":"7-11 May 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18321608","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8563639/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Multi-User MIMO Hybrid Precoding Design in Millimeter Wave Cellular Systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"WP1H_03_456_1_0.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093597S","chronDate":"7-11 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540789","isNumber":"8563258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540789","xplore-issue":"8563258","articleId":"8563639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8563643,"authors":[{"name":"Min Guo","affiliation":["IEEE Conference Publishing College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085850514"},{"name":"Yi Lin","affiliation":["IEEE Conference Publishing College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085744964"},{"name":"Zhanshan Sun","affiliation":["IEEE Conference Publishing College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhanshan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086284744"},{"name":"Yunqi Fu","affiliation":["IEEE Conference Publishing College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yunqi","lastName":"Fu","id":"37086288272"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2416-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2415-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2417-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8563643","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Radar cross-sections","Phantoms","Integrated circuit modeling","Printed circuits","Plastics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","conducting bodies","electromagnetic wave propagation","object detection","radar cross-sections","radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monostatic radar cross section simulation","small Unmanned Aerial","detection technology","VAV radar","primary prerequisite","radar detection","monostatic RCS","RCS fluctuation","radar cross-section","civil unmanned aerial vehicles","frequency 10.0 GHz","noise figure 20.0 dB"]}],"abstract":"With the increasing applications of small civil Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), the detection technology of small VAV radar has become a hot research.

For this approach's practicability, simple dipole antenna is adopted as the array's element to check out whether the approach keeps validity by simulation.","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2018.8563842","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540789/8563258/08563842.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2018.8563842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8563258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grating Lobe Suppression of Planar Array with Large Inter-Element Spacing by Using Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gratings","Antenna radiation patterns","Genetic algorithms","Dipole antennas","Planar arrays","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","broadband antennas","dipole antenna arrays","genetic algorithms","planar antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lobe suppression","lower frequency point","highest sidelobe level","high operating frequency point","adjacent elements","wideband planar array","grating lobe","genetic algorithm","inter-element spacing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Grating lobe suppression","genetic algorithm","distance optimization","sparse array"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Grating Lobe Suppression of Planar Array with Large Inter-Element Spacing by Using Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8563842/","publicationDate":"May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"7-11 May 2018","accessionNumber":"18321416","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grating Lobe Suppression of Planar Array with Large Inter-Element Spacing by Using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"MP2E_06_558_2_0.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051213S","chronDate":"7-11 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540789","isNumber":"8563258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540789","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8563258","articleId":"8563842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8563858,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxin Jing","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianxin","lastName":"Jing","id":"37086538712"},{"name":"Jialin Cai","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Hangzhou Dianzi University"],"firstName":"Jialin","lastName":"Cai","id":"37086129664"},{"name":"Chao Yu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Yu","id":"38488678000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2416-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2415-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2417-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8563858","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"abstract":"In this paper, the tolerance of power amplifier's (PA) characteristics is investigated for a shared digital predistortion (DPD) solution for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

However, implementing 5G in HSR scenarios remains a challenge as high speed makes the channel doubly selective. Nevertheless, polar codes, as the first provably capacity-achieving codes with low encoding and decoding complexity appear to be a promising coding strategy to tackle this problem. To the best of our knowledge, although polar codes have been studied extensively in theoretical issues, the performance of polar codes in high mobility scenarios, i.e., HSR, has not been investigated before. To give guidance on practical application of polar codes in HSR scenario, we model the channel with doubly selective feature based on 3GPP standard, and implement polar codes in such channel to get the performance evaluation compared with polar codes in AWGN channel. Numerical results show that polar codes with short block-length and large list size are preferable in high speed mobility scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation on Polar Codes in High Mobility Scenarios","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT)","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2018.8563941","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540789/8563258/08563941.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2018.8563941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8563258","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8563941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation on Polar Codes in High Mobility Scenarios","conferenceDate":"7-11 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8563941/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18321579","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation on Polar Codes in High Mobility Scenarios","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"WP1H_05_708_3_0.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047589S","chronDate":"7-11 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540789","isNumber":"8563258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540789","xplore-issue":"8563258","articleId":"8563941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8563968,"authors":[{"name":"Congyu Xu","affiliation":["The 41st Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Congyu","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086540783"},{"name":"Liutai Wei","affiliation":["The 41st Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Liutai","lastName":"Wei","id":"37086538706"},{"name":"Xiu Dai","affiliation":["The 41st Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Xiu","lastName":"Dai","id":"37086537601"},{"name":"Shu Zhang","affiliation":["The 41st Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085543537"},{"name":"Jiawen Sun","affiliation":["The 41st Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Jiawen","lastName":"Sun","id":"37075973300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2416-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2415-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2417-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8563968","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip","Microwave circuits","Slot lines","Loss measurement","Microwave measurement","Frequency conversion","Baluns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["baluns","frequency response","millimetre wave circuits","pulse generators","slot lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["slot line balun","thin-film microstrip sampler","LO pulse","impulse generator","frequency response","microwave frequency counter","frequency 40.0 GHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563968","abstract":"This paper mainly describes a 40GHz thin-film microstrip sampler.

In most of the models, researchers use a stochastic process or several stochastic processes to describe a real system. However, due to the absence of theoretical conclusions of any arbitrary stochastic processes, they approximate the complicated model into simple processes that have mathematical results, such as Markov processes. Our purpose is to give a universal method to deal with common stochastic processes as long as the processes can be expressed in the form of transition matrix. To achieve our purpose, we firstly prove several theorems about the convergence of stochastic matrices to figure out what kind of matrix-defined systems has steady states. Furthermore, we propose two strategies for measuring the rate of convergence which reflects how fast the system would come to its steady state. Finally, we give a method for reducing a stochastic matrix into smaller ones, and perform some experiments to illustrate our strategies in practice.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 14th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8563058/8564238/08564262.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"76","publicationTitle":"2018 14th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","doi":"10.1109/CIS2018.2018.00024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS2018.2018.00024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8564238","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8564262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis on Convergence of Stochastic Processes in Cloud Computing Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Convergence","Computational modeling","Biological system modeling","Cloud computing","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","Markov processes","matrix algebra","resource allocation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocations","cloud computing systems","cloud computing models","stochastic matrix","matrix-defined systems","stochastic matrices","common stochastic processes","Markov processes","complicated model","arbitrary stochastic processes","stochastic process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing, Stochastic Process, Stochastic Matrix, Convergence, Rate of Convergence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8564262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Analysis on Convergence of Stochastic Processes in Cloud Computing Models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8564262/","publicationDate":"Nov 2018","accessionNumber":"18362496","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis on Convergence of Stochastic Processes in Cloud Computing Models","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"016900a071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056007S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8563058","isNumber":"8564238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8563058","xplore-issue":"8564238","articleId":"8564262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8564271,"authors":[{"name":"Miaomiao Chen","affiliation":["Inner Mongolia Hohhot, Inner Mongolia University, China"],"firstName":"Miaomiao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086562963"},{"name":"Fengshan Bai","affiliation":["Inner Mongolia Hohhot, Inner Mongolia University, China"],"firstName":"Fengshan","lastName":"Bai","id":"37086555092"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0169-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0170-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8564271","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Feature extraction","Training","Image recognition","Standards","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","diagnostic radiography","feature extraction","image recognition","image segmentation","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["k-mean segmentation","Xray image recognition","BP network model","image feature extraction","image segmentation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["x ray image","BP neural network","convergence rate","training error","recognition rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8564271","abstract":"In order to make x ray image recognition to apply to BP neural network effectively.

To solve this problem, this paper proposed a traffic classification algorithm based on the improved capsule neural network (CapsNet), which replaces the scalar feature output of CNN with vector output, and replaces the max-pooling with consistent routing, and disturbs some values in the capsule to reconstruct images. The experimental results show that the proposed method have a robust performance compared with the existing CNN method when processing small data sets, which corresponds the fact that the grayscale images output by the reconstruction module can make the classification results easier to understand.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8564283/","accessionNumber":"18342989","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8564283/","publicationDate":"Nov 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Network Traffic Classification Method Based on Improved Capsule Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Traffic Classification Method Based on Improved Capsule Neural Network","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"016900a174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094002S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8563058","isNumber":"8564238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8563058","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8564238","articleId":"8564283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8564291,"authors":[{"name":"Hengzhou Xu","affiliation":["School of Network Engineering, Zhoukou Normal University, Zhoukou, China"],"firstName":"Hengzhou","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085654431"},{"name":"Hai Zhu","affiliation":["School of Network Engineering, Zhoukou Normal University, Zhoukou, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086562235"},{"name":"Mengmeng Xu","affiliation":["School of Network Engineering, Zhoukou Normal University, Zhoukou, China"],"firstName":"Mengmeng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086563721"},{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["School of Network Engineering, Zhoukou Normal University, Zhoukou, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086560545"},{"name":"Sifeng Zhu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhoukou Normal University, Zhoukou, China"],"firstName":"Sifeng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086560796"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0169-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0170-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8564291","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8564291","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Null space","Computational intelligence","Security","Computer science","Hardware","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","graph theory","parity check codes","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polynomial equations","girth analysis","Tanner (5,11) quasicyclic LDPC codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC code","quasi-cyclic","girth","prime field"]}],"abstract":"Motivated by the works on the girth of Tanner (3,5), (3,7), (3,11), and (5,7) quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes, we in this paper study the girth of Tanner (5,11) QC-LDPC codes.

The reason is that the solutions of multi-objective optimization problem is a set of Pareto solutions which are non-dominated each other, and the obtained Pareto solutions are often not well distributed and cannot satisfy the needs of decision makers. It may be the case that decision-makers expect to have a solution in an area to assist them for making decisions. In this paper, we propose a local search strategy based on linear programming and construct a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on linear programming (MOEA/LP). MOEA/LP algorithm makes up for the large \u201cgap\u201d in Pareto front, and makes Pareto optimal solutions over Pareto front more uniform and more extensive. Thereby, the decision makers use MOEA/LP algorithm to make more effective choice. Experiment results show the proposed algorithm has better performance according to some measure indices such as running time, hypervolue and C metric, etc.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 14th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8563058/8564238/08564320.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"348","publicationTitle":"2018 14th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","doi":"10.1109/CIS2018.2018.00082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS2018.2018.00082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8564238","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8564320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Linear Programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational intelligence","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","evolutionary computation","linear programming","Pareto optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming","Pareto front","multiobjective optimization problem","decision makers","MOEA/LP","Pareto optimal solutions","multiobjective evolutionary algorithm","Pareto solution set"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MOEA","Linear Programming","Local Search","Pareto Solutions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8564320/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Linear Programming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8564320/","publicationDate":"Nov 2018","accessionNumber":"18343022","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Linear Programming","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"016900a345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078728S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8563058","isNumber":"8564238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8563058","xplore-issue":"8564238","articleId":"8564320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8564322,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Wang","affiliation":["Yulin Normal University, Yulin, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086558943"},{"name":"Tingting Lan","affiliation":["Yulin Normal University, Yulin, China"],"firstName":"Tingting","lastName":"Lan","id":"37086556894"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0169-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0170-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8564322","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handheld computers","Conferences","Computational intelligence","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","genetic algorithms","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high girth LDPC codes","structure LDPC codes","Low-density Parity-check codes","algebra permutation group","girth larger parity check matrix","Gallager parity check matrix set","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC codes","genetic algorithm","permutation group","check matrix"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8564322","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 14th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8563058/8564238/08564322.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS2018.2018.00084","doi":"10.1109/CIS2018.2018.00084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8564238","publicationTitle":"2018 14th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Construct High Girth LDPC Codes Based on Permutation Groups","abstract":"In the field of wireless communications, it is of great significance to structure LDPC codes (Low-density Parity-check codes) with large girth.

The traditional model of CNN only can be sent with the fixed traffic dataset in network traffic classification. But for the traffic dataset in network, that model must lead to a certain degree loss of the dataset by truncated or discarded. To solve this defect, a new CNN traffic classification model based on sppnet (spatial pyramid pooling) is proposed in this paper. Based on the CNN model of the LeNet-5, in the pooling layer before the fully connected layer, the new model is replaced the max-pooling to the spatial pyramid pooling which can realize the network traffic with indefinite length dataset. Through a series of experiments, the model has achieved certain achievement, and reducing the impact of human factors on traffic classification.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method of CNN Traffic Classification Based on Sppnet","doi":"10.1109/CIS2018.2018.00093","startPage":"390","endPage":"394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS2018.2018.00093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8564238","publicationTitle":"2018 14th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 14th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8563058/8564238/08564331.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8564331","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8564331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Method of CNN Traffic Classification Based on Sppnet","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8564331/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","publicationDate":"Nov 2018","accessionNumber":"18343033","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method of CNN Traffic Classification Based on Sppnet","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"016900a390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085946S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8563058","isNumber":"8564238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8563058","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8564238","articleId":"8564331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8564368,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksandr Sidun","affiliation":["Higher school of applied physics and space technologies, Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, St. Petersburg, Russia"],"firstName":"Aleksandr","lastName":"Sidun","id":"37086350813"},{"name":"Mikhail Gaidukov","affiliation":["Higher school of applied physics and space technologies, Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, St. Petersburg, Russia"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Gaidukov","id":"37086545955"},{"name":"Ivan Piatak","affiliation":["Higher school of applied physics and space technologies, Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, St. Petersburg, Russia"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Piatak","id":"37076268200"},{"name":"Yakob Belyaev","affiliation":["State Research Center of Russian Federation Concern CSRI Electropribor, St. Petersburg, Russia"],"firstName":"Yakob","lastName":"Belyaev","id":"37085805827"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8122-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-8121-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8123-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8564368","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":575},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Power demand","Transfer functions","Operational amplifiers","Inverters","Modulation","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","low-power electronics","operational amplifiers","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power ADC","operational amplifier","estimated power consumption","latch-based ring-amplifiers","DC gain","self-biased ring-amplifiers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pipelined ADC","ring amplifier","low-power","ultrasound medical imaging","delta-sigma ADC","integrator","CMOS inverter","operational amplifier","SC-circuits"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8564368","abstract":"In this paper two implementations of the ring amplifier for the low-power ADCs are discussed.

However, using switched mode PAs of envelope signal (ES) is accompanied by the emergence of nonlinear distortions, which can appear as undesirable components in the RF PA signal spectrum. One of the ways to reduce the negative influence of the switched mode is to use ES PA of multicell structure. The paper covers the issues of the ES PA number of cells influence on its efficiency and output signal distortion, as well as its influence on the efficiency and output signal distortion of the RF PA. It is shown that rational choice of the number of cells allows to increase the efficiency of ES PA from 94 through 98% and to reduce the level of intermodulation components in the envelope signal spectrum by 20 ... 25 dB.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8564361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EExPolytech.2018.8564443","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Photonics (EExPolytech)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Photonics (EExPolytech)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8541053/8564361/08564443.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"47","doi":"10.1109/EExPolytech.2018.8564443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Distortion Decreasing in Envelope Tracking Power Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Signal Distortion Decreasing in Envelope Tracking Power Amplifiers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-23 Oct. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8564443/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18323196","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8564443/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Distortion Decreasing in Envelope Tracking Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"014-44-47-Pergushev.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046518S","chronDate":"22-23 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8541053","isNumber":"8564361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8541053","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8564361","articleId":"8564443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8564487,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Pachajoa","affiliation":["University of Vienna, Faculty of Computer Science, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Pachajoa","id":"37086560430"},{"name":"Markus Levonyak","affiliation":["University of Vienna, Faculty of Computer Science, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Levonyak","id":"37086553723"},{"name":"Wilfried N.

In the exact state reconstruction (ESR) approach, which is based on a method proposed by Chen (2011), the solver keeps extra information from previous search directions of the (S)PCG solver, so that its state can be fully reconstructed if a node fails unexpectedly. ESR does not make use of checkpointing or external storage for saving dynamic solver data and has only negligible computation and communication overhead compared to the failure-free situation. In exact arithmetic, the reconstruction is exact, but in finite-precision computations, the number of iterations until convergence can differ slightly from the failure-free case due to rounding effects. We perform experiments to investigate the behavior of ESR in floating-point arithmetic and compare it to the heuristic linear interpolation (LI) approach by Langou et al. (2007) and Agullo et al. (2016), which does not have to keep extra information and thus has lower memory requirements. Our experiments illustrate that ESR, on average, has essentially zero overhead in terms of additional iterations until convergence, whereas the LI approach incurs much larger overheads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-16 Nov. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8564487/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8564487/","publicationDate":"Nov 2018","accessionNumber":"18342900","conferenceDate":"16-16 Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"Extending and Evaluating Fault-Tolerant Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Methods","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extending and Evaluating Fault-Tolerant Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Methods","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"022200a049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094121S","chronDate":"16-16 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8563018","isNumber":"8564478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8563018","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8564478","articleId":"8564487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8564522,"authors":[{"name":"David Pinos-M\u00e9ndez","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department and GITEL, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica Salesiana, Cuenca, Ecuador"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Pinos-M\u00e9ndez","id":"37086554936"},{"name":"Juan Inga","affiliation":["Universidad Politecnica Salesiana, Cuenca, Azuay, EC"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Inga"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7612-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7613-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8564522","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Predictive models","Dictionaries","Compressed sensing","Matching pursuit algorithms","Prediction algorithms","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","energy measurement","load forecasting","power consumption","power engineering computing","signal reconstruction","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["P1P","load curves","compressible EEC signals","electrical energy measurement vectors","Potential Polynomials of Degree One","electrical consumption prediction","reconstruction algorithms","compressed sensing","electrical energy consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consumption prediction, Compressed Sensing, MAPE, P1P, Prediction of Electrical Energy Consumption, Sparse Reconstruction"]}],"abstract":"The proposal of this current work is to take advantage of statistic and periodic attributes of Electrical Energy Consumption (EEC) by using Potential Polynomials of Degree One (P1P) in estimation and forecast of parameters related with load curves obtained from different student buildings.

In this paper alternative approach is proposed which is based on low cost microscope and digital camera coupled with appropriate algorithm for WBCs detection and identification in a blood image. The proposed algorithm consists of two steps. An image of blood sample is segmented in order to detect possible WBCs which are then further classified with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) into 5 classes.

Chopper modulation is introduced to suppress low-frequency noise and a DC servo loop is utilized to suppress electrode drift, achieving a low high-pass cut-off frequency point for noise suppression.

It enables new reduced-complexity designs for sensor nodes and helps reduce overall transmission power in wireless sensor network. For on-site analysis in E-health applications, mobile data aggregator that performs real-time signal reconstruction at the body side is necessary. However, with high computational complexity of the reconstruction algorithms, software solutions cannot fulfill the energy efficiency needs for real-time processing. As a result, CS reconstruction engine was proposed to bring the signal intelligence closer to the user for timely prediction and decision-making. To design a highly efficient CS reconstruction engine on mobile platforms, two major design issues should be considered, including 1) throughput and energy efficiency, and 2) reconstruction quality. In this paper, the design challenges and concepts of CS reconstruction engine are introduced. In addition, the representative related works are reviewed and summarized.

The parabolic equations with proper selection of coefficients and factorized operation orders based on optimized hardware cost and delay are finally utilized to enhance SFDR. The proposed design is demonstrated by the physical implementation on Altera FPGA platform. The average SFDR is measured to be 68.4242 dBc with 1.1659 dBc deviation over 33 times of experiments.

This work could thus pave the way for the development of new in-memory computing architecture with high efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2018.8565029","publicationTitle":"2018 14th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology (ICSICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 14th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology (ICSICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540788/8564801/08565029.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2018.8565029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8564801","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonvolatile memristor as a new platform for non-von Neumann computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2018-Nov. 3 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565029/","displayDocTitle":"Nonvolatile memristor as a new platform for non-von Neumann computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8565029/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18321296","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonvolatile memristor as a new platform for non-von Neumann computing","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"S28-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080569S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2018-Nov. 3 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540788","isNumber":"8564801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540788","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8564801","articleId":"8565029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8565040,"authors":[{"name":"Genwei Tang","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Genwei","lastName":"Tang","id":"37086537886"},{"name":"Xiaoyang Zeng","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyang","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37086360100"},{"name":"Yibo Fan","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yibo","lastName":"Fan","id":"37085862865"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4441-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4440-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-4439-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4442-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8565040","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Information filters","High efficiency video coding","Very large scale integration","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filters","video coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["High Efficiency Video Coding","high throughput","DBF module","basic filter unit","block filtering","DBF throughput","real-time video coding","SRAM-free HEVC deblocking filter VLSI architecture","8K application","bit rate","video coding standard","TSMC process","size 65.0 nm"]}],"abstract":"Deblocking filter (DBF) is an efficient tool to reduce the bit rate in the latest video coding standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC).

Some ADCs still need amplifiers for realizing higher speed or higher resolution while a SAR ADC without the need of an amplifier becomes dominant in many applications. A pipelined ADC uses residue amplifiers for high resolution with high speed conversion. A delta-sigma ADC uses amplifiers for integrators to achieve very high resolution. An op-amp is conventionally used to realize highly accurate gain and linearity, however it is slow and not energy efficient. The dynamic amplifier can realize ultimate low energy operation owing to dynamic action to cut the static operating current. The issues are low gain accuracy and linearity. To address these issues, we proposed digital interpolation technique and time-domain linearizer technique for the pipelined ADC. Furthermore, we proposed an open-loop complete integrator using dynamic amplifiers for a delta-sigma modulator to reduce the energy consumption. A SAR+DS ADC using proposed integrator demonstrates very low energy and high resolution A/D conversion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2018-Nov. 3 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8565050/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18293409","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Low Energy ADCs using Dynamic Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Energy ADCs using Dynamic Amplifiers","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"S48-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031967S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2018-Nov. 3 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540788","isNumber":"8564801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540788","xplore-issue":"8564801","articleId":"8565050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8565641,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Wei Huang","affiliation":["College of Physics and Information Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ji-Wei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086244914"},{"name":"Tai-Ming Huang","affiliation":["College of Physics and Information Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tai-Ming","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086539860"},{"name":"Fan-Yang Li","affiliation":["College of Physics and Information Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fan-Yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37086051074"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4441-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4440-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-4439-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4442-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8565641","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":450},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruments","Electrodes","Electrocardiography","Low pass filters","Earth Observing System","Legged locomotion","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","CMOS integrated circuits","electrocardiography","feedback amplifiers","instrumentation amplifiers","low-pass filters","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CFIA","CMRR instrumentation amplifier","OTA-C low-pass filter","electrode offset voltage","operational transconductance amplifier-capacitor low-pass filter","CMOS process","current feedback instrumentation amplifier","ECG acquisition systems","low electrode","common mode rejection ratio","leg drive module","electrode offset cancellation module","electrocardiogram acquisition systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CFIA","electrode offset cancellation","right leg drive","OTA-C filter","ECG signal amplifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565641","abstract":"A current feedback instrumentation amplifier (CFIA) for electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition systems is proposed in this paper.

Experimental results shows the performance density and power efficiency of our design can reach 0.054GOPS/DSP and 5.24GOPS/W respectively when accelerating SqueezeNet.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2018-Nov. 3 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18293410","htmlLink":"/document/8565657/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A FPGA-based Hardware Accelerator for Multiple Convolutional Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A FPGA-based Hardware Accelerator for Multiple Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"P2-44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083324S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2018-Nov. 3 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540788","isNumber":"8564801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540788","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8564801","articleId":"8565657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8565658,"authors":[{"name":"Yifan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086542879"},{"name":"Jianfei Jiang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jianfei","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085642798"},{"name":"Qin Wang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086266879"},{"name":"Nin Guan","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Aerospace Electronic Communication Equipment, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Nin","lastName":"Guan","id":"37086261905"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4441-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4440-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-4439-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4442-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8565658","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":351},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Entropy","Throughput","Delay lines","Ring oscillators","Generators","Jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","field programmable gate arrays","random number generation","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information security","ultra-fast carry-logic primitives","TRNG","entropy extraction efficiency","Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA","true random number generator","high quality random numbers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["True random number generator (TRNG)","self-timed ring (STR)","carry chain","high throughput"]}],"abstract":"True random number generators (TRNGs) are essential components for information security.

In this paper, we evaluated the Ka band LNA, SPDT, and PA based on both processes. A 28GHz LNA designed with 45nm RFSOI does present a lower noise figure advantage of about 1.4dB compared to ~2dB noise figure of a LNA designed with SiGe NPN. For SPDT, due to low parasitic capacitance in SOI process, based on traditional stack solution, RFSOI process shows about 1dB IL advantage compared with SPDT designed with a bulk SiGe BiCMOS process. While in the high performance SiGe process, a transmission line based SPDT or other advanced topology can get better performance than traditional stack solution with larger area. For PA's, the SiGe device has higher breakdown voltage than a single FET in 45nm CMOS process, so from power density point of view, SiGe has higher power density. But the SOI process provides the stack solution, so the RFSOI overall output power of a single PA without power combination is similar to one designed with the SiGe NPN.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ka Band FEM Design Comparison with 45nm RFSOI CMOS and High Performance SiGe BiCMOS","publicationTitle":"2018 14th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology (ICSICT)","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2018.8565660","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 14th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology (ICSICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540788/8564801/08565660.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2018.8565660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8564801","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565660/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2018-Nov. 3 2018","displayDocTitle":"Ka Band FEM Design Comparison with 45nm RFSOI CMOS and High Performance SiGe BiCMOS","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8565660/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18321197","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ka Band FEM Design Comparison with 45nm RFSOI CMOS and High Performance SiGe BiCMOS","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"S15-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091784S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2018-Nov. 3 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540788","isNumber":"8564801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540788","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8564801","articleId":"8565660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8565665,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-Tian Ling","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yao-Tian","lastName":"Ling","id":"37086537731"},{"name":"Zong-Wei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zong-Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085795900"},{"name":"Yi-Chen Fang","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi-Chen","lastName":"Fang","id":"37085785544"},{"name":"Jian Kang","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Kang","id":"37086032875"},{"name":"Lin-Dong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lin-Dong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086309443"},{"name":"Yu-Chao Yang","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu-Chao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085614213"},{"name":"Yi-Mao Cai","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi-Mao","lastName":"Cai","id":"37535484200"},{"name":"Ru Huang","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ru","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086037695"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4441-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4440-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-4439-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4442-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8565665","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistance","Integrated circuit modeling","Logic circuits","Mathematical model","Random access memory","Electrodes","Sputtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit noise","integrated circuit reliability","logic circuits","logic design","random noise","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random telegraph noise","resistive random access memory","multiple RTN patterns","RRAM devices","noise immunity","IMP logic circuit","nonvolatile logic circuit","RTN effect"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565665","abstract":"Random telegraph noise (RTN) in resistive random access memory (RRAM) introduces variation in resistance which might cause errors in RRAM based logic circuits.

As a result, our design can process up to 6 bins per clock cycle and delivers an average of 4.67 bins per clock cycle. It can work at the frequency of 516Mhz when synthesized in 65 nm.

A few non-volatile technologies especially magnetic random access memory (MRAM) technologies are proposed to deal with this issue. Among them, spin transfer torque (STT) MRAM is a possible candidate for future on-chip cache design. However, as the cache capacity keeps growing, STT-MRAM suffers the bottlenecks on both operation speed and power efficiency. In this context, a new NAND-like spin orbit torque (SOT)-based MRAM, NAND-SPIN, which combines the high density of the STT-MRAM and the high performance of the SOT- MRAM has been proposed. Thanks to these benefits, NAND-SPIN could be more suitable for the future large capacity application. In the paper, we evaluate the NAND-SPIN for on-chip cache design in terms of performance, area and power consumption. The runtime system level experimental results show that NAND- SPIN has higher performance/power efficiency compared to SRAM, STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM, especially in the large capacity

But how to guarantee the accuracy and speed while minimizing the consumption of hardware resources is the most critical issue in the current SoftMax hardware design. The available Polynomial Fitting and CORDIC are contradictory in resource occupancy and accuracy. To meet the need of SoftMax, this paper proposes a new method named Basic-Split Calculation. Taking advantage of the math feature of exponential function, the Basic-Split Calculation method splits the exponentiation calculation of the SoftMax into several specific basics which is implemented by look-up table. Based on this strategy, the complex exponential calculation process is implemented by look-up table procedure and multiply operation. It simplify the hardware complexity and logic propagation delay remarkably.

By studying the effect of pulse parameters including rising time, holding time and falling time on the output voltage waveform, we summarized a method to mimic the action potential of real neuron by adjusting proper bias on resistive device precisely. Since this RRAM device resistance hasn't been changed after pulse operating, so there is no need to generate reverse RESET voltage, which reduces the complexity of peripheral circuits. In addition, only one single RRAM device is involved in this operation, indicating that this method is capable to minimize the number of devices to form electronic neurons without increasing the complexity of circuit and the area of chip.","publicationTitle":"2018 14th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology (ICSICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 14th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology (ICSICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540788/8564801/08565709.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Actually Mimicking of Neuron Action Potential by A Single RRAM Device","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2018.8565709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8564801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2018.8565709","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2018-Nov. 3 2018","displayDocTitle":"Actually Mimicking of Neuron Action Potential by A Single RRAM Device","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18321230","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8565709/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Actually Mimicking of Neuron Action Potential by A Single RRAM Device","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"S02-6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085292S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2018-Nov. 3 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540788","isNumber":"8564801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540788","xplore-issue":"8564801","articleId":"8565709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8565722,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291794500"},{"name":"YiZhou Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"YiZhou","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086540745"},{"name":"XiaoLi Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"XiaoLi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086119319"},{"name":"Li Geng","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Geng","id":"37427054500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4441-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4440-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-4439-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4442-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8565722","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":455},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","computer vision","feedforward neural nets","field programmable gate arrays","Internet of Things","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNN acceleration","computational complexity","highly reusable data buffer architecture","maximal data reuse","minimal external memory access","WRA accelerator","CNNs models","average convolution performance","reconfigurable accelerator","fast Winograd algorithm","convolutional neural network","effective method","compute vision tasks","Internet of Things devices","Xilinx XC7Z102 platform","ShuffleNet","IoT scenarios","Winograd based reconfigurable architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CNN","Winograd","reconfigurable","IoT"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reconfigurable accelerator based on fast Winograd algorithm for convolutional neural network in Internet of Things","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565722","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2018.8565722","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2018 14th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology (ICSICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 14th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology (ICSICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540788/8564801/08565722.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2018.8565722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8564801","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is an effective method widely applied in various compute vision tasks. However, it is increasingly difficult to take efficiency and configurability into account simultaneously as CNNs become more and more complicated, especially on Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To address this problem, this paper proposed a Winograd based reconfigurable architecture (WRA) for CNN acceleration. Via fully exploring the parallelism of Winograd algorithm, computational complexity can be largely reduced. Furthermore, a highly reusable data buffer architecture was proposed to realize maximal data reuse and minimal external memory access, which contributes to eliminate the bottleneck of memory bandwidth. Besides, the WRA accelerator can be dynamically reconfigurable so that most of CNNs models can be implemented quickly. WRA was implemented using Xilinx XC7Z102 platform and run at 150MHz clock frequency. Under the test of ShuffleNet, the WRA accelerator achieved 2137.2 GOP/s average convolution performance and 82.39 GOPS/W energy efficiency, which can satisfy both of the performance requirement and power limitation for most IoT scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2018-Nov. 3 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565722/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8565722/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18307871","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"A reconfigurable accelerator based on fast Winograd algorithm for convolutional neural network in Internet of Things","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reconfigurable accelerator based on fast Winograd algorithm for convolutional neural network in Internet of Things","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"S22-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058115S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2018-Nov. 3 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540788","isNumber":"8564801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540788","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8564801","articleId":"8565722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8565755,"authors":[{"name":"Yanwen Zhang","affiliation":["BDBC, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanwen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086542632"},{"name":"Peng Ouyang","affiliation":["BDBC, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Ouyang","id":"38057184600"},{"name":"Shouyi Yin","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shouyi","lastName":"Yin","id":"37400289900"},{"name":"Youguang Zhang","affiliation":["BDBC, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Youguang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086041751"},{"name":"Weisheng Zhao","affiliation":["BDBC, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weisheng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086539944"},{"name":"Shaojun Wei","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaojun","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085341905"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4441-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4440-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-4439-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4442-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8565755","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Buffer storage","Microsoft Windows","Three-dimensional displays","Kernel","Memory management","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","convolution","data flow computing","feedforward neural nets","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AI systems","artificial intelligence","computing efficient hardware architecture","zero-valued feature maps","redundant memory consumption","convolutional neural networks","sparse deep neural network computing","NN accelerator","zero-valued weights","memory division","data reuse mechanism","near-zero-cost scheduling switching","dataflow processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CNN","Spatial Architecture","Dataflow processing"]}],"abstract":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated significant performance in AI (artificial intelligence) systems. However, CNNs often have tens or even hundreds of neural layers with millions of parameters to achieve state-of-the-art performance, which hinders the deployment to some resource limited scenarios. Meanwhile, those parameters and data usually are sparse, which results in useless calculation as well as unbalanced calculation. To solve these problem, we propose a computing efficient hardware architecture. In order to decrease calculating redundancy, we filter zero-valued weights and zero-valued feature maps. To reduce redundant memory consumption, we propose a memory division and a data reuse mechanism. To resolve load imbalance, we implement a near-zero-cost scheduling switching strategy. Experimental results show that our architecture saves, on average, 22.6% memory times and 60.5% computing time over the state-of-the-art NN accelerator.","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2018.8565755","publicationTitle":"2018 14th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology (ICSICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 14th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology (ICSICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540788/8564801/08565755.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2018.8565755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8564801","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Computing Efficient Hardware Architecture for Sparse Deep Neural Network Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2018-Nov. 3 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565755/","displayDocTitle":"A Computing Efficient Hardware Architecture for Sparse Deep Neural Network Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8565755/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18293422","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Computing Efficient Hardware Architecture for Sparse Deep Neural Network Computing","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"S45-6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050438S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2018-Nov. 3 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540788","isNumber":"8564801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540788","xplore-issue":"8564801","articleId":"8565755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8565763,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Li","id":"37086542890"},{"name":"Zheng-Yuan Su","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zheng-Yuan","lastName":"Su","id":"37086271364"},{"name":"Meng-Qi Wen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Meng-Qi","lastName":"Wen","id":"37086541304"},{"name":"Yao Yao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Yao","id":"37086139234"},{"name":"Zhi-Yuan Ye","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhi-Yuan","lastName":"Ye","id":"38551892400"},{"name":"Lei Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086539313"},{"name":"Peng-Fei Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Peng-Fei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086539277"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4441-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4440-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-4439-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4442-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8565763","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565763","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programming","Logic gates","Nonvolatile memory","Electric fields","Split gate flash memory cells","Fabrication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","technology CAD (electronics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["injection efficiency","Silvaco technology computer aided design","Silvaco TCAD","high-density source-side-injection flash memory cell","device structure","vertical channel"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel device structure of Flash memory cells with vertical channel is proposed and simulated by Silvaco technology computer aided design (TCAD).

High-Efficiency Video Coding(HEVC) standard is a new video compression standard which can double the compression ratio with respect to the previous H.264/AVC standard at the same level of video quality. H.265/HEVC adopts the quad-tree coding structure, leading to serious design problems, such as high computational complexity, high energy consumption and huge external memory bandwidth requirement. Frame memory recompression is an efficient way to reduce both system power and external memory traffic. This work emphasizes the hardware implementation of a high-throughput reference frame recompression scheme. Compared to no compression, the proposed algorithm can reach an average lossless compression rate of 51.0% for evaluated video sequences. The hardware architecture is implemented with 29.5k gates for the compressor and 14.4k gates for the decompressor at 500MHz using TSMC 65nm CMOS standard-cell libraries.

With both weights and activations binarized to +1 or -1 in BNNs, the high-precision multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations can be replaced by XNOR and bit-counting operations. In this work, we present two computing-in-memory (CIM) architectures with parallelized weighted-sum operation for accelerating the inference of BNN: 1) parallel XNOR-SRAM, where a customized 8T-SRAM cell is used as a synapse; 2) parallel XNOR-RRAM, where a customized bit-cell consisting of 2T2R cells is used as a synapse. For large-scale weight matrices in neural networks, the array partition is necessary, where multi-level sense amplifiers (MLSAs) are employed as the intermediate interface for accumulating partial weighted sums. We explore various design options with different sub-array sizes and sensing bit-levels. Simulation results with 65nm CMOS PDK and RRAM models show that the system with 128\u00d7128 sub-array size and 3-bit MLSA can achieve 87.46% for an inspired VGG-like network on CIFAR-10 dataset, showing less than 1% degradation compared to the ideal software accuracy.

The proposed method is extended from seam carving, which is another image resizing method. Seam carving uses the energy map from an image. It also removes a seam where the energy is the minimum. We propose a method for creating a deep energy map using an encoder\u2013decoder convolution neural network. A deep energy map preserves important parts or boundaries in an image, without distortion. Furthermore, it has the characteristic that uniform intensity of edges is displayed for all images. Four well-known resizing methods and our proposed method were evaluated in terms of aspect ratio similarity. In such an objective evaluation, the proposed method demonstrated better results than the other four algorithms.

The dynamic metabolic model under study represents five metabolic pathways with more than 170 kinetic parameters at steady state with a 0.1 dilution rate. In this paper, identification is declared in two steps. The first step is to identify which kinetic parameters have a higher impact on the model response using local sensitivity analysis results upon increasing each kinetic parameter up to 2.0 by steps of 0.5, while the second step uses highly sensitive kinetic results to be identified and minimized the model simulation metabolite errors using real experimental data by adopting. However, this paper focuses on adopting segment particle swarm optimization (PSO) and PSO algorithms for large-scale kinetic parameters identification. Among the 170 kinetic parameters investigated, seven kinetic parameters were found to be the most effective kinetic parameters in the model response after finalizing the sensitivity. The seven sensitive kinetic parameters were used in both the algorithms to minimize the model response errors. The validation results proved the effectiveness of both the proposed methods, which identified the kinetics and minimized the model response errors perfectly.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885118","startPage":"78622","endPage":"78639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08565855.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segment Particle Swarm Optimization Adoption for Large-Scale Kinetic Parameter Identification of <i>Escherichia Coli</i> Metabolic Network Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565855/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Segment Particle Swarm Optimization Adoption for Large-Scale Kinetic Parameter Identification of <i>Escherichia Coli</i> Metabolic Network Model","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8565855/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18597642","publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003093","fundingName":"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005605","fundingName":"Universiti Malaysia Pahang","grantNumber":"RDU 160101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Segment Particle Swarm Optimization Adoption for Large-Scale Kinetic Parameter Identification of <italic>Escherichia Coli</italic> Metabolic Network Model","sourcePdf":"access-azrag-2885118-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103182S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8565855","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8565856,"authors":[{"name":"Li Sun","affiliation":["Information Engineering College, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8565856/lsun-2885358-small.gif","p":["Li Sun received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2011, 2014, and 2017, respectively.

The carrier-based approach guarantees the fixation of switching frequency and improves the total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD + N) by reducing the effect of nonlinearities in the power stage. In addition to the output voltage, the CBDISM controller requires current feedback from the capacitive filter, which is advantageous as the capacitor current is bidirectional and enables the use of a current transformer for feedback, thereby not affecting the cost and overall efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed CBDISM controller is verified using computer simulation and experimental study.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885330","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08565864.pdf","startPage":"1275","endPage":"1283","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier-Based Double Integral Sliding-Mode Controller of Class-D Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Carrier-Based Double Integral Sliding-Mode Controller of Class-D Amplifier","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8565864/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565864/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Carrier-Based Double Integral Sliding-Mode Controller of Class-D Amplifier","sourcePdf":"access-zaman-2885330-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093249S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8565864","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8565880,"authors":[{"name":"Guosong Sun","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering & Science, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/9316344/8565880/sun-2884928-small.gif","p":["Guosong Sun received the bachelor's degree in computer science & technology from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China.

In this paper, a malware feature images generation method is used to combine the static analysis of malicious code with the methods of recurrent neural networks (RNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). By using an RNN, our method considers not only the original information of malware but also the ability to associate the original code with timing characteristics; furthermore, the process reduces the dependence on category labels of malware. Then, we use minhash to generate feature images from the fusion of the original codes and the predictive codes from the RNN. Finally, we train a CNN to classify feature images. When we trained very few samples (the proportion of the sample size of training dataset to validation dataset was 1:30), we obtained accuracy over 92 percent. When we adjust the proportion to 3:1, the accuracy exceeds 99.5 percent. As shown in confusion matrices, our method obtains a good result, where the worst false positive rate of all the malware families is 0.0147 and the average false positive rate is 0.0058.","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2018.2884928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9316344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2018.2884928","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/8858/9316344/08565880.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning and Visualization for Identifying Malware Families","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning and Visualization for Identifying Malware Families","volume":"18","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8565880/","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2021","accessionNumber":"20342674","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565880/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB0704400 and 2016YFB0700504"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003399","fundingName":"Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality","grantNumber":"15DZ2260301"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007219","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai","grantNumber":"16ZR1411200"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning and Visualization for Identifying Malware Families","sourcePdf":"tdsc-qian-2884928-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140914S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"9316344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"9316344","articleId":"8565880","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8565890,"authors":[{"name":"Gerhard P.

In this paper, we suggest that the high-level features of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks trained in visual spectra images are potentially domain independent and can be used to encode faces sensed in different image domains. A generic framework for Heterogeneous Face Recognition is proposed by adapting Deep Convolutional Neural Networks low-level features in, so-called, Domain Specific Units. The adaptation using the Domain Specific Units allows the learning of shallow feature detectors specific for each new image domain. Furthermore, it handles its transformation to a generic face space shared between all image domains. Experiments carried out with four different face databases covering three different image domains show substantial improvements, in terms of recognition rate, surpassing the state-of-the-art for most of them. This work is made reproducible: all the source code, scores, and trained models of this approach are made publicly available.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8672149/08565895.pdf","startPage":"1803","endPage":"1816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2018.2885284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2018.2885284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8672149","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous Face Recognition Using Domain Specific Units","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Databases","Face recognition","Feature extraction","Protocols","Visualization","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","face recognition","image matching","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual spectra images","face images","thermal images","domain specific units","deep convolutional neural networks","heterogeneous face recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","heterogeneous face recognition","reproducible research","domain adaptation","deep neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous Face Recognition Using Domain Specific Units","volume":"14","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8565895/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"18529060","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001711","fundingName":"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F\u00f6rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Heterogeneous Face Recognition Using Domain Specific Units","sourcePdf":"tifs-defreitaspereira-2885284-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141688S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8672149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8672149","articleId":"8565895","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8565896,"authors":[{"name":"Arijit Raychowdhury","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/8589029/8565896/raych-2878854-small.gif","p":["Arijit Raychowdhury (Senior Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, in 2007.","He joined Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2013.

This is accompanied by the realization that binary abstraction and Boolean logic, which have been the foundations of modern computing revolution, fall short of the desired performance and power efficiency. In particular, hard computing problems relevant to pattern matching, image and signal processing, optimizations, and neuromorphic applications require alternative approaches. In this paper, we review recent advances in oscillatory dynamical system-based models of computing and their implementations. We show that simple configurations of oscillators connected using simple electrical circuits can result in interesting phase and frequency dynamics of such coupled oscillatory systems. Such networks can be controlled, programmed, and observed to solve computationally hard problems. Although our discussion in this paper is limited to insulator-to-metal transition devices and spin-torque oscillators, the general philosophy of such a computing paradigm of \u201clet physics do the computing\u201d can be translated to other mediums as well, including micromechanical and optical systems. We present an overview of the mathematical treatments necessary to understand the time evolution of these systems and highlight the recent experimental results in this area that suggest the potential of such computational models.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2018.2878854","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2018.2878854","startPage":"73","endPage":"89","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/8589029/08565896.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8589029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computing With Networks of Oscillatory Dynamical Systems","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5/8589029/8565896-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"Computing With Networks of Oscillatory Dynamical Systems","volume":"107","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18339646","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8565896/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1640081"},{"fundingName":"Nanoelectronics Research Corporation (NERC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC), through Extremely Energy Efficient Collective Electronics (EXCEL), an SRC-NRI Nanoelectronics Research Initiative","grantNumber":"2698.001 and 2698.002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-11-1-0665"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100002418","fundingName":"Intel Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Computing With Networks of Oscillatory Dynamical Systems","sourcePdf":"jproc-raychowdhury-2878854-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.224697S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"8589029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8589029","articleId":"8565896","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8565897,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Additionally, it has been shown that full-duplex (FD) communication has the potential of doubling the bandwidth efficiency. However, the presence of significant residual self-interference (SI), which is especially more pronounced at mmWave frequencies because of the non-linearities in the hardware components, erodes the full potential of FD in practice. Conventionally, the residual SI is canceled in the baseband using digital processing with the aid of a transmit precoder. In this work, we propose a hybrid beamforming design for FD mmWave communications, where the SI is canceled by the joint design of beamformer weights at the radio-frequency and the precoder as well as combiner in the baseband. Our proposed design preserves the dimensions of the transmit signal, while suppressing the SI. We demonstrate that our joint design is capable of reducing the SI by upto 30 dB, hence performing similarly to the interference-free FD system while being computationally efficient. Our simulation results show that the proposed design significantly outperforms eigen-beamforming.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2884049","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8640274/08565897.pdf","startPage":"1394","endPage":"1404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8640274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2884049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Beamforming Design for Full-Duplex Millimeter Wave Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Beamforming Design for Full-Duplex Millimeter Wave Communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565897/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18467738","htmlLink":"/document/8565897/","volume":"68","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"InterDigital as well as the European Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Hybrid Beamforming Design for Full-Duplex Millimeter Wave Communication","sourcePdf":"tvt-hanzo-2884049-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09573S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8640274","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"8640274","articleId":"8565897","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8565903,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Ali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Portland State University, Portland, OR, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Muhammad Ali (S\u201910\u2013M\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology at Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

However, CNFET-specific additional features such as the number of tubes, pitch (spacing between tubes), tube position, and diameter in array of tubes play a significant role in accurate PPA evaluation. Furthermore, count and density variations in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) due to manufacturing limitations, like the presence of metallic tubes in the CNFET channel, degrade the anticipated PPA benefits. Moreover, modeling the CNFET parameters, CNT variations and etching techniques for CNTs create additional complexity during performance optimization. Hence, for realistic optimization of CNFET circuit's performance, it is imperative to incorporate the impact of these parameters and variations. In this paper, we propose delay models [pitch-aware logical effort (PALE) and position-aware pitch factor (PAPF)] for fast and accurate performance evaluation by including the impact due to CNFET-specific parameters and CNT variations. These models are developed based on industry standard logical effort framework. Furthermore, we present an optimization tool using PALE and PAPF to minimize the delay and area of CNFET circuits. We deploy several circuit-level techniques prior to optimizing the tubes (CNTs) in the logic gates to achieve globally optimum solution. For better optimization of the circuits, we also include the impact of wire parasitic in estimating the delay of the individual gates. Our optimization tool results in the maximum and average delay improvement by 27% and 17%, respectively, and 2.5\u00d7 reduction in area for standard ISCAS and OpenSPARC benchmark circuits. Fast and fairly accurate delay computation in our optimization framework offers great runtime benefits as compared to state-of-the-art simulation and statistical-based methods.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2880322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8649697/08565903.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8649697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2880322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logical Effort Framework for CNFET-Based VLSI Circuits for Delay and Area Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","displayDocTitle":"Logical Effort Framework for CNFET-Based VLSI Circuits for Delay and Area Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565903/","publicationDate":"March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18486042","htmlLink":"/document/8565903/","volume":"27","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logical Effort Framework for CNFET-Based VLSI Circuits for Delay and Area Optimization","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-ali-2880322-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122963S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8649697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8649697","articleId":"8565903","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8565904,"authors":[{"name":"Woongsoo Na","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Woongsoo Na received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in computer science and engineering from Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2010, 2012, and 2017, respectively.","He was an Adjunct Professor with the School of Information Technology, Sungshin University, Seoul, from 2017 to 2018.

Edge computing facilities are an alternative to traditional cloud computing and support massive data processing in IoT systems while reducing the burden on data centers. In this paper, we consider an edge-based IoT system that comprises an edge server (ES), edge gateways (EGs), and IDs that communicate wirelessly. The EGs reduce the load on the ES by preprocessing data received from ID. However, it may not be possible for a few EGs to accommodate a sheer number of IDs, given the limited computing power and communication coverage of the EGs. Therefore, it is necessary for a few IDs to directly connect to the ES without the support of EGs. Thus, we propose a resource orchestration scheme between EGs and ES and/or among EGs based on a Lagrangian and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition. The scheme allocates optimal resources by considering the computing capacities of EGs and ES and manages interference among the EGs to maximize the efficiency of IoT systems. The performance evaluation indicates that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of aggregate throughput, latency, data reception rate, and workload fairness among EGs by 42%, 59%, 37%, and 40%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2885348","startPage":"4910","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8738925/08565904.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2885348","endPage":"4920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8738925","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Resource Allocation and Interference Management in Mobile Edge Computing for an Internet of Things System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565904/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Resource Allocation and Interference Management in Mobile Edge Computing for an Internet of Things System","volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8565904/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18758104","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2019","publicationDate":"June 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science ICT","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1A2B4009802"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Resource Allocation and Interference Management in Mobile Edge Computing for an Internet of Things System","sourcePdf":"jiot-cho-2885348-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135884S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8738925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8738925","articleId":"8565904","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8565906,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhai Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, and the College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8755890/8565906/liu-2885365-small.gif","p":["Jinhai Liu (M\u201909) received the B.S. degree in automation from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2002, and the M.S. degree in power electronics and power transmission and Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2005 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently a Professor and Doctoral Supervisor with Northeastern University.

This paper proposes a small-sample WT fault detection method with the synthetic fault data using generative adversarial nets (GANs). First, based on prior knowledge, a rough fault data generation process is developed to transform the normal data to the rough fault data. Second, a rough fault data refiner is developed by GANs to make the rough fault data more similar with the real fault data. Moreover, to make the generated data better suited to the WT conditions, GANs are improved in both the generative model and the discriminative model. Third, artificial intelligence (AI)-based WT fault detection models can be well trained by using only the generated data in the condition of small fault data sample. Finally, three groups of generated data evaluation experiments and four groups of WT fault detection comparative experiments are conducted using real WT data collected from a wind farm in northern China. The results indicate that the method proposed in this paper is effective.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565906/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","volume":"15","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"18794392","dateOfInsertion":"04 July 2019","publicationDate":"July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8565906/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Small-Sample Wind Turbine Fault Detection Method With Synthetic Fault Data Using Generative Adversarial Nets","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds"},{"fundingName":"Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"N170404019"},{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFF0108800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473069 and 61627809"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Small-Sample Wind Turbine Fault Detection Method With Synthetic Fault Data Using Generative Adversarial Nets","sourcePdf":"tii-liu-2885365-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101882S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8755890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"8755890","articleId":"8565906","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8565907,"authors":[{"name":"Kui Liu","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg","College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/9318455/8565907/liu-2884955-small.gif","p":["Kui Liu (Member, IEEE) received the PhD degree from the University of Luxembourg, in 2019 and the master degree in computer engineering from Southwest University, China, in 2013.

However, the adoption of these tools is hindered by their high false positive rates. If the false positive rate is too high, developers may get acclimated to violation reports from these tools, causing concrete and severe bugs being overlooked. Fortunately, some violations are actually addressed and resolved by developers. We claim that those violations that are recurrently fixed are likely to be true positives, and an automated approach can learn to repair similar unseen violations. However, there is lack of a systematic way to investigate the distributions on existing violations and fixed ones in the wild, that can provide insights into prioritizing violations for developers, and an effective way to mine code and fix patterns which can help developers easily understand the reasons of leading violations and how to fix them. In this paper, we first collect and track a large number of fixed and unfixed violations across revisions of software. The empirical analyses reveal that there are discrepancies in the distributions of violations that are detected and those that are fixed, in terms of occurrences, spread and categories, which can provide insights into prioritizing violations. To automatically identify patterns in violations and their fixes, we propose an approach that utilizes convolutional neural networks to learn features and clustering to regroup similar instances. We then evaluate the usefulness of the identified fix patterns by applying them to unfixed violations. The results show that developers will accept and merge a majority (69/116) of fixes generated from the inferred fix patterns. It is also noteworthy that the yielded patterns are applicable to four real bugs in the Defects4J major benchmark for software testing and automated repair.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565907/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2021","volume":"47","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"20285930","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2021","publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/8565907/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Mining Fix Patterns for FindBugs Violations","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001866","fundingName":"Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg","grantNumber":"FIXPATTERN C15/IS/9964569 and RECOMMEND C15/IS/10449467"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT","grantNumber":"2017M3C4A7068179"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mining Fix Patterns for FindBugs Violations","sourcePdf":"tse-liu-2884955-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.209101S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"9318455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9318455","articleId":"8565907","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8565909,"authors":[{"name":"Walter da C.

The inherent self-interference of GFDM prohibits the direct utilization of maximum likelihood (ML) detection of space-time coding (STC) in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channels. Recently, a modified version of GFDM, called coded GFDM (CGFDM), has been proposed, which solves the problem of interference mitigation. In this paper, a simple near-optimal ML detection of Alamouti STC is proposed for MIMO CGFDM. Simulation results show that without sacrificing bandwidth efficiency, the proposed scheme outperforms the current MIMO GFDM detection techniques in terms of BER and computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2018.2885485","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8580441/08565915.pdf","startPage":"798","endPage":"807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2018.2885485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8580441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple ML Detection for Coded Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing in MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565915/","displayDocTitle":"A Simple ML Detection for Coded Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing in MIMO Channels","volume":"67","issue":"3","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2019","accessionNumber":"18371475","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8565915/","dateOfInsertion":"01 January 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple ML Detection for Coded Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing in MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"tsp-asgaritabatabaee-2885485-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071608S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8580441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8580441","articleId":"8565915","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8565917,"authors":[{"name":"Shachar Siboni","affiliation":["Department of Software and Information Systems Engineering, Cyber Security Research Center, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/24/8656610/8565917/sibon-2864536-small.gif","p":["Shachar Siboni received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in communication\nsystems engineering from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU),\nBeersheba, Israel, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree\nat the Department of Software and Information Systems Engineering.","For the last 15 years, he has worked in a variety of roles at leading\ncompanies in the hi-tech industry, ranging from IT Technical Leader,\nCommunication Systems Engineer, Real-Time Embedded Software\nEngineer/Developer and Team Leader, to Security Researcher and Project\nManager.

One of the major problems associated with the IoT is the heterogeneous nature of such deployments; this heterogeneity poses many challenges, particularly, in the areas of security and privacy. Specifically, security testing and analysis of IoT devices is considered a very complex task, as different security testing methodologies, including software and hardware security testing approaches, are needed. In this paper, we propose an innovative security testbed framework targeted at IoT devices. The security testbed is aimed at testing all types of IoT devices, with different software/hardware configurations, by performing standard and advanced security testing. Advanced analysis processes based on machine learning algorithms are employed in the testbed in order to monitor the overall operation of the IoT device under test. The architectural design of the proposed security testbed along with a detailed description of the testbed implementation is discussed. The testbed operation is demonstrated on different IoT devices using several specific IoT testing scenarios. The results obtained demonstrate that the testbed is effective at detecting vulnerabilities and compromised IoT devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565917/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","volume":"68","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"18506012","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8565917/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Security Testbed for Internet-of-Things Devices","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Singapore Ministry of Defense (MINDEF)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Security Testbed for Internet-of-Things Devices","sourcePdf":"tr-siboni-2864536-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.202683S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"8656610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8656610","articleId":"8565917","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8565918,"authors":[{"name":"Dusan Gostimirovic","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/8383726/8565918/gosti-2885486-small.gif","p":["Dusan Gostimirovic (M'18) received the B.Eng.

Our model can optimize SWG-based grating couplers for a single fundamental-order polarization, or both, by splitting them counter-directionally at the grating level. Alternating, SWG sections are adopted to reduce the reflections (loss) of standard, single-etch devices-further accelerating the design time by eliminating the need to process a second etch. The model of this device is trained by a dense uniform dataset of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) optical simulations. Our approach requires the FDTD simulations to be made up front, where the resulting ANN model is made openly available for the rapid, software-free design of future standard photonic devices, which may require slightly different design parameters (e.g., fiber angle, center wavelength, and polarization) for their specific application. By transforming the nonlinear input-output relationship of the device into a matrix of learned weights, a set of simple linear algebraic and nonlinear activation calculations can be made to predict the device outputs 1830 times faster than numerical simulations, within 93.2% accuracy of the simulations.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2018.2885486","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of

Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown high performances comparable to or even better than widely used and adopted machine learning techniques. The aim of this study is to investigate the application of CNNs for land cover classification by using two-dimensional (2-D) spectral curve graphs from multispectral satellite images. The land cover classification was conducted in Concord, New Hampshire, USA, and South Korea by using multispectral images acquired from 30-m Landsat-8 and 500-m Geostationary Ocean Color Imager images. For the construction of input data specific to CNNs, two seasons (winter and summer) of multispectral bands were transformed into 2-D spectral curve graphs for each class. Land cover classification results of CNNs were compared with the results of support vector machines (SVMs) and random forest (RFs). The CNNs model showed higher performance than RFs and SVMs in both study sites. The examination of land cover classification maps demonstrates a good agreement with reference maps, Google Earth images, and existing global scale land cover map, especially for croplands. Using the spectral curve graph could incorporate the phenological cycles on classifying the land cover types. This study shows that the use of a new transformation of spectral bands into a 2-D form for application in CNNs can improve land cover classification performance.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2880783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/8602368/08565922.pdf","startPage":"4604","endPage":"4617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8602368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2880783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional Neural Network-Based Land Cover Classification Using 2-D Spectral Reflectance Curve Graphs With Multitemporal Satellite Imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Convolutional Neural Network-Based Land Cover Classification Using 2-D Spectral Reflectance Curve Graphs With Multitemporal Satellite Imagery","htmlLink":"/document/8565922/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2019","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18360072","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Space Technology Development Program"},{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingName":"National Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education of Korea","grantNumber":"NRF-2017M1A3A3A02015981 and NRF-2017R1D1A1B03028129"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional Neural Network-Based Land Cover Classification Using 2-D Spectral Reflectance Curve Graphs With Multitemporal Satellite Imagery","sourcePdf":"jstars-im-2880783-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160491S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"8602368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8602368","articleId":"8565922","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8565923,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Tello-Oquendo","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Chimborazo, Riobamba, Ecuador"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Tello-Oquendo","orcid":"0000-0002-5274-666X","id":"37085807864"},{"name":"Vicent Pla","affiliation":["Institute ITACA, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Vicent","lastName":"Pla","orcid":"0000-0002-0894-9494","id":"37331147700"},{"name":"Israel Leyva-Mayorga","affiliation":["Institute ITACA, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Israel","lastName":"Leyva-Mayorga","orcid":"0000-0002-7116-397X","id":"37085705065"},{"name":"Jorge Martinez-Bauset","affiliation":["Institute ITACA, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Martinez-Bauset","orcid":"0000-0003-3342-3037","id":"38269953500"},{"name":"Vicente Casares-Giner","affiliation":["Institute ITACA, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Vicente","lastName":"Casares-Giner","orcid":"0000-0002-6947-8470","id":"38276595900"},{"name":"Luis Guijarro","affiliation":["Institute ITACA, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Guijarro","orcid":"0000-0001-9774-9728","id":"37546012400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"8565923","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":502},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"The deployment of machine-type communications (MTC) together with cellular networks has a great potential to create the ubiquitous Internet-of-Things environment. Nevertheless, the simultaneous activation of a large number of MTC devices (named UEs herein) is a situation difficult to manage at the evolved Node B (eNB). The knowledge of the joint probability distribution function (PDF) of the number of successful and collided access requests within a random access opportunity (RAO) is a crucial piece of information for contriving congestion control schemes. A closed-form expression and an efficient recursion to obtain this joint PDF are derived in this paper. Furthermore, we exploit this PDF to design estimators of the number of contending UEs in an RAO. Our numerical results validate the effectiveness of our recursive formulation and show that its computational cost is considerably lower than that of other related approaches. In addition, our estimators can be used by the eNBs to implement highly efficient congestion control methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Closed-form solutions","Cellular networks","Probability density function","Computational efficiency","Uplink","Probability distribution","Microsoft Windows"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","Internet of Things","Long Term Evolution","statistical distributions","telecommunication congestion control","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient random access channel evaluation","massive MTC","machine-type communications","cellular networks","MTC devices","evolved Node B","eNB","joint probability distribution function","random access opportunity","RAO","congestion control schemes","closed-form expression","joint PDF","LTE-A","access requests","congestion control methods","efficient random access load estimation","ubiquitous Internet-of-Things environment","contending UE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular systems","machine-type communications (MTC)","random access channel (RACH)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2885333","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8640274/08565923.pdf","startPage":"1998","endPage":"2002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8640274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2885333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Random Access Channel Evaluation and Load Estimation in LTE-A With Massive MTC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Random Access Channel Evaluation and Load Estimation in LTE-A With Massive MTC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565923/","volume":"68","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8565923/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18467753","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain","grantNumber":"TIN2013-47272-C2-1-R and TEC2015-71932-REDT"},{"fundingName":"CONACYT-Gobierno del Estado de M\u00e9xico","grantNumber":"383936"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Random Access Channel Evaluation and Load Estimation in LTE-A With Massive MTC","sourcePdf":"tvt-tellooquendo-2885333-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099886S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8640274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8640274","articleId":"8565923","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8565925,"authors":[{"name":"Shuai Ma","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8667745/8565925/ma-2885352-small.gif","p":["Shuai Ma received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in communication and information systems from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2009 and 2016, respectively.

First, we derive both a lower bound and an upper bound of the achievable rates with closed-form expressions for static users in NOMA VLC networks. With the derived lower bound, we minimize transmit power under the minimum rate requirements and individual light emitting diodes (LED) power constraints, which turns out to be NP-hard. By exploiting the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique, the optimal power allocation scheme can be obtained by solving a convex semidefinite program (SDP). Second, we develop an optimal power allocation scheme for mobile users. Due to users' movement, the estimated channel state information (CSI) may be inaccurate. We first characterize the CSI uncertainties as ellipsoidal regions, and derive a lower bound of the achievable rate expression. Then, we study the transmit power minimization problem for mobile users, which is non-convex. By applying S-lemma and SDR, the transmit power minimization problem can be reformulated as a convex SDP. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed power allocation schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2885352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2885352","startPage":"2233","endPage":"2244","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

recognition tasks. Although numerous algorithms have been proposed, it is still challenging due to the limited labeled data. One representative work is the Laplacian-regularized multitask dictionary learning (LR-MTDL) that employs graph Laplacian regularization terms to fully utilize both the labeled and unlabeled information. However, it probably conduces to poor extrapolating power because Laplacian regularization biases the solution toward a constant function. In this letter, we propose a Hessian-regularized multitask dictionary learning to learn a source-data set-shared but target-data set-biased representation for RS image recognition. Particularly, Hessian can properly exploit the intrinsic local geometry of the data manifold and finally leverage the performance. Extensive experiments on four RS image data sets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with baseline algorithms including single-task dictionary learning and LR-MTDL.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hessian-Regularized Multitask Dictionary Learning for Remote Sensing Image Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2018.2881834","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/8695190/08565932.pdf","startPage":"821","endPage":"825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2018.2881834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8695190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565932/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","displayDocTitle":"Hessian-Regularized Multitask Dictionary Learning for Remote Sensing Image Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8565932/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18620298","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671480"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003091","fundingName":"Shandong Province","grantNumber":"ZR2018MF017"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Petroleum (East China)","grantNumber":"18CX07011A and YCX2017059"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772455 and U1713213"},{"fundingName":"Yunnan Natural Science Funds","grantNumber":"2016FB105"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007839","fundingName":"Yunnan University","grantNumber":"WX069051"},{"fundingName":"Macau Science and Technology Development Fund","grantNumber":"FDCT/189/2017/A3"},{"fundingName":"Research Committee at University of Macau","grantNumber":"MYRG2016-00123-FST and MYRG2018-00136-FST"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701387"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hessian-Regularized Multitask Dictionary Learning for Remote Sensing Image Recognition","sourcePdf":"lgrs-liu-2881834-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068074S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"8695190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","xplore-issue":"8695190","articleId":"8565932","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8565935,"authors":[{"name":"Yongmin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8709863/8565935/zhang-2885453-small.gif","p":["Yongmin Zhang (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2015.","He was a Visiting Student with the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.

Mobile edge servers shall first satisfy the computation requirements of mobile users and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and then wholesale redundant computation resources to the cloud networks to maximize their profit. Due to the coarse time granularity of wholesales, computation resource buyback may happen occasionally to deal with traffic bursts. Thus, the mobile edge servers need to make a tradeoff between the wholesale profit and the buyback cost. In this paper, the computation resource management problem is modeled as profit maximization. To solve this problem, we first analyze the relationship among the reserved computation resources, the computation tasks of mobile users and IoT devices, and the buyback cost. Then, we design an efficient wholesale scheme to determine the amount of the wholesaled computation resources, by which the total expected profit of the mobile edge server can be maximized. Given the reserved computation resources, we also propose a fast-convergent realtime buyback scheme for mobile edge servers to minimize the buyback cost. Finally, the simulation results show that our proposed efficient wholesale and buyback scheme can increase the total profit while guaranteeing the computation delay of all the computation tasks, especially when the computation workloads are time-varying.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565935/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","volume":"6","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"18653858","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2019","publicationDate":"April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8565935/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Computation Resource Management in Mobile Edge-Cloud Computing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61702450 and 61629302"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100013020","fundingName":"Compute Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Computation Resource Management in Mobile Edge-Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"jiot-cai-2885453-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.201154S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8709863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8709863","articleId":"8565935","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8565942,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel S.

Our aim is to maximize the minimum source or sensing rate of nodes. This rate is determined by the available energy at sensor nodes as well as link capacity, which is determined by the set of transmitting nodes. In this paper, we first study and show the benefits of energy sharing. Intuitively, a sensor node should share its energy if doing so increases source rates. We present a novel Linear Program (LP) to determine the routing, link schedule, energy transmission, and reception time that maximize the minimum source rate of a given R-WSN. Our numerical results indicate that, on average, the minimum transmission rate of sensor nodes increased by 16.03 percent when nodes share energy. This motivates the development of a practical protocol called E-RSVP that iteratively increases the time slots of each source node. It also considers using time slots for transmission or reception of energy. Our simulation results show E-RSVP yields minimum source rates that are 14.80 percent higher as compared to the case without energy sharing.","doi":"10.1109/TSUSC.2018.2885049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSUSC.2018.2885049","startPage":"107","endPage":"120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274860/9027020/08565945.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9027020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Optimizing Max Min Rate in Rechargeable Wireless Sensor Networks with Energy Sharing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565945/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"On Optimizing Max Min Rate in Rechargeable Wireless Sensor Networks with Energy Sharing","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2020","accessionNumber":"19428073","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8565945/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501207 and 61802454"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Optimizing Max Min Rate in Rechargeable Wireless Sensor Networks with Energy Sharing","sourcePdf":"tsusc-chin-2885049-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179125S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"7274860","isNumber":"9027020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7274860","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"9027020","articleId":"8565945","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8565946,"authors":[{"name":"Tri-Nhu Do","affiliation":["Ubiquitous Networks and Convergence Laboratory, Hongik University, Sejong, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tri-Nhu","lastName":"Do","orcid":"0000-0002-9857-6723","id":"37085463395"},{"name":"Van-Dinh Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of ICMC Convergence Technology, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Van-Dinh","lastName":"Nguyen","orcid":"0000-0002-9575-1063","id":"37085382784"},{"name":"Oh-Soon Shin","affiliation":["Department of ICMC Convergence Technology, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Oh-Soon","lastName":"Shin","orcid":"0000-0002-6984-8240","id":"37271728500"},{"name":"Beongku An","affiliation":["Department of Software and Communications Engineering, Hongik University, Sejong, South Korea"],"firstName":"Beongku","lastName":"An","orcid":"0000-0002-0587-3754","id":"37300683700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8565946","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":804},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565946","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Recycling","Uplink","Downlink","Communication networks","Optimization","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","concave programming","inductive power transmission","MIMO communication","optimisation","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless powered communication networks","wireless power transfer techniques","FD hybrid access point","wireless powered UL user","spectral efficiency","power budget","full-duplex radio","nonconvex problem","low-complexity path following algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless powered communication networks","full-duplex","sum-rate maximization","path-following algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose a novel simultaneous uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmission scheme aiming to achieve a higher spectral efficiency for wireless power communication networks (WPCNs).

However, unexpected loss mechanisms, i.e. dynamic Rds,on phenomena and Coss-losses, are appearing in currently available GaN transistors and are compromising their operation. In this paper, measurements of Coss-losses are performed in a dedicated calorimetric measurement setup and, through a systematic approach, the root cause of the loss mechanism is potentially identified. Afterward, with the essential support of a manufacturer of power semiconductors, a novel transistor, featuring an enhanced multilayer III-N buffer, is developed according to the acquired knowledge. A significant reduction in terms of Coss-losses, i.e. of soft-switching losses, and the absence of dynamic Rds,on phenomena are verified experimentally on the new device. These achievements enable a significant performance improvement for future soft-switching power converters featuring GaN-on-Si HEMTs.","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2018.2885442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2018.2885442","startPage":"679","endPage":"694","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics

optical systems with circular multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (C-mQAM). After amplitude segmentation and phase rotation, the particular distribution of the constellation points in a C-mQAM signal is exploited to construct a special cost function to provide a rough estimate of phase noise. The cost function can be replaced with a simple cosine function, and only two or three test phases are required for the calculation of its parameters. The performances of different cost functions are compared and simulation results show that the cost function can be chosen with the high phase noise tolerance and low computational complexity. Maximum-likelihood phase noise estimation algorithm is combined with the proposed algorithm to mitigate residual phase noise. Compared to the single-stage blind phase search and n-phase-shift keying partitioning algorithms, the numerical results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage algorithm shares similar phase noise tolerance and offers a lower computational complexity for a 28-GBaud back-to-back coherent optical QAM transmission system.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2884024","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/8586963/08565963.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2884024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8586963","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Blind Carrier Phase Recovery for C-mQAM Coherent Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Blind Carrier Phase Recovery for C-mQAM Coherent Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565963/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"7200214","volume":"11","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18466332","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8565963/","impactStatement":"A simple cost function is used to realize the phase noise estimation roughly with rather lower computational complexity.

Excellent and reliable network service is important for network development. Moreover, as the number of network users increases, network service construction costs become very high. Therefore, an efficient algorithm is necessary to provide an SFC with excellent performance and low resource costs. In this paper, we re-examine the problem of optimizing the deployment of an SFC to provide users with excellent and resource-saving network service. We propose a heuristic, closed-loop feedback (CLF) algorithm to find the shortest path to map an SFC. To solve the problem, we introduce and integrate a restricted Boltzmann machine and cross entropy to improve the performance of CLF. Simulation results demonstrate the excellent performance of CLF. The communication delay is reduced by approximately 20%, the accept ratio improves by approximately 15%, and the algorithm running time decreases by approximately 20%. In addition, the resource utilization ratio increases by approximately 15%, and the resource fragmentation ratio decreases by approximately 50%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8565965/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2019","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19157287","volume":"13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Efficient Service Function Chain Orchestration for Low-Latency Applications in NFV Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571098"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2016J217"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013314","fundingName":"Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project","grantNumber":"B14039"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Efficient Service Function Chain Orchestration for Low-Latency Applications in NFV Networks","sourcePdf":"jsyst-sun-2879883-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143119S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8910483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8910483","articleId":"8565965","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":8565967,"authors":[{"name":"Dingliang Wen","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8660595/8565967/wen-2884849-small.gif","p":["Dingliang Wen received the B.S. degree in electric science and technology and the M.E. degree from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

The antenna operates from 2.4 to 2.49 GHz, which can cover Bluetooth/WiFi band. The design procedure is based on the theory of characteristic modes and it is discussed thoroughly. By employing a pair of degenerated modes to design the MIMO antenna, a high port-to-port isolation can be achieved over the operating frequency band. Simulated and measured results are presented to verify the antenna design. Furthermore, the antenna has a low envelope correlation coefficient and a high effective diversity gain even when it is mounted on the human phantom. Hence, the proposed antenna proves to be a good candidate for smartwatch applications.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2018.2884849","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8660595/08565967.pdf","startPage":"1437","endPage":"1447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2018.2884849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8660595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a MIMO Antenna With High Isolation for Smartwatch Applications Using the Theory of Characteristic Modes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8565967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565967/","displayDocTitle":"Design of a MIMO Antenna With High Isolation for Smartwatch Applications Using the Theory of Characteristic Modes","volume":"67","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18505916","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8565967/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003816","fundingName":"Huawei Technologies"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a MIMO Antenna With High Isolation for Smartwatch Applications Using the Theory of Characteristic Modes","sourcePdf":"tap-wen-2884849-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082229S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8660595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8660595","articleId":"8565967","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8565973,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo Passos","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/9318455/8565973/leona-2884911-small.gif","p":["Leonardo Passos received the PhD degree in computer engineering from the University of Waterloo, Canada, in 2016.

Scattering is not necessarily bad if used with care, as witnessed by systems with highly scattered features that evolved successfully. Feature scattering, often realized with a pre-processor, circumvents limitations of programming languages and software architectures. Unfortunately, little is known about the principles governing scattering in large and long-living software systems. We present a longitudinal study of feature scattering in the Linux kernel, complemented by a survey with 74, and interviews with nine Linux kernel developers. We analyzed almost eight years of the kernel's history, focusing on its largest subsystem: device drivers. We learned that the ratio of scattered features remained nearly constant and that most features were introduced without scattering. Yet, scattering easily crosses subsystem boundaries, and highly scattered outliers exist. Scattering often addresses a performance-maintenance tradeoff (alleviating complicated APIs), hardware design limitations, and avoids code duplication. While developers do not consciously enforce scattering limits, they actually improve the system design and refactor code, thereby mitigating pre-processor idiosyncrasies or reducing its use.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565973/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2021","volume":"47","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"20341772","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2021","publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/8565973/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Study of Feature Scattering in the Linux Kernel","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Vinnova Sweden","grantNumber":"2016-02804"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Vetenskapsr\u00e5det","grantNumber":"257822902"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","grantNumber":"AP206/5, AP 206/6 and AP 206/11"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Feature Scattering in the Linux Kernel","sourcePdf":"tse-mukelabai-2884911-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128716S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"9318455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9318455","articleId":"8565973","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8565977,"authors":[{"name":"Quentin Gueuning","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8660595/8565977/gueun-2885414-small.gif","p":["Quentin Gueuning received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from the Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, in 2012 and 2014, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics (ICTEAM).","Since 2014, he has been a Research Assistant with ICTEAM, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain.

The performance of these applications depends on the distinctiveness of the visual feature descriptors used, and the speed at which they can be extracted from video frames. When combined with standard key-point detectors, the rotation-aware binary robust independent elementary features (rBRIEF) descriptor has been shown to outperform its counterparts. In this paper, we present a deep-pipelined stream processing architecture that is capable of extracting rBRIEF features from high-throughput video frames. To achieve high processing rate and low complexity hardware, the proposed architecture incorporates an enhanced moving summation strategy to calculate the key-points' patch moments and employs approximate computations to achieve patch rotation. Multiplier-less circuitry is introduced throughout the architecture to avoid the use of costly multipliers. Implementation on the Altera Aria V device demonstrates that the proposed architecture leads to 53.3% reduction in hardware resources (adaptive logic modules), while achieving 50% higher accuracy (in terms of average Hamming distance) when compared to the state-of-the-art architecture. In addition, the proposed architecture is able to process high-resolution ($1920 \\times 1080$ ) images at 60 fps, while consuming only 456.15 mW power.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2881105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8672976","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2881105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8672976/08565982.pdf","startPage":"747","endPage":"756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Throughput and Area-Optimized Architecture for rBRIEF Feature Extraction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"High-Throughput and Area-Optimized Architecture for rBRIEF Feature Extraction","volume":"27","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8565982/","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18529003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565982/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Research Foundation Singapore"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Throughput and Area-Optimized Architecture for rBRIEF Feature Extraction","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-pham-2881105-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110744S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8672976","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8672976","articleId":"8565982","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8565984,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Bozorgchenani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7511293/8668827/8565984/bozor-2885443-small.gif","p":["Arash Bozorgchenani (S\u201917) was born in Rasht, Iran, in 1989.

A fog network is a feasible solution for implementing edge computing services. Within this scenario, the deployed fog nodes (FNs) are able to offload different portions of a single task to the available nodes to be processed at the network edge. However, to partially offload, FNs consume an extra amount of energy for transmission and reception of the tasks while saving energy by not processing the whole task on their own. Moreover, offloading requires an extra transmission and reception time to the task processing time. In this paper, the focus is on a partial offloading approach where the tradeoff between FN energy consumption and task processing delay is considered when estimating the portion to be offloaded to the available devices at the edge of the network by comparing a centralized and a distributed architecture. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation solutions in terms of FN energy consumption, average task delay, and network lifetime.","doi":"10.1109/TGCN.2018.2885443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGCN.2018.2885443","startPage":"250","endPage":"263","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/7511293/8668827/08565984.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8668827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Centralized and Distributed Architectures for Energy and Delay Efficient Fog Network-Based Edge Computing Services","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565984/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"Centralized and Distributed Architectures for Energy and Delay Efficient Fog Network-Based Edge Computing Services","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2019","accessionNumber":"18529255","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8565984/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"\u201cGAUChO\u2014A Green Adaptive Fog Computing and Networking Architecture\u201d Project"},{"fundingName":"MIUR Progetti di Ricerca di Rilevante Interesse Nazionale Bando 2015","grantNumber":"2015YPXH4W_004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Centralized and Distributed Architectures for Energy and Delay Efficient Fog Network-Based Edge Computing Services","sourcePdf":"tgcn-tarchi-2885443-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09302S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7511293","isNumber":"8668827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7511293","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8668827","articleId":"8565984","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8565987,"authors":[{"name":"Lianlin Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lianlin","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-2295-4425","id":"37085354105"},{"name":"Long Gang Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Long Gang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085891109"},{"name":"Fernando L.

However, it poses important challenges arising from its intrinsic strong nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and expensive computational costs. To tackle these difficulties, we, for the first time to our best knowledge, exploit a connection between the deep neural network (DNN) architecture and the iterative method of nonlinear EM inverse scattering. This enables the development of a novel DNN-based methodology for nonlinear EM inverse problems (termed here DeepNIS). The proposed DeepNIS consists of a cascade of multilayer complex-valued residual convolutional neural network modules. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate that the DeepNIS outperforms remarkably conventional nonlinear inverse scattering methods in terms of both the image quality and computational time. We show that DeepNIS can learn a general model approximating the underlying EM inverse scattering system. It is expected that the DeepNIS will serve as powerful tool in treating highly nonlinear EM inverse scattering problems over different frequency bands, which are extremely hard and impractical to solve using conventional inverse scattering methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565987/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","volume":"67","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"18505888","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8565987/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DeepNIS: Deep Neural Network for Nonlinear Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471006"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"111-2-05"},{"fundingName":"AFOSR","grantNumber":"FA9550-16-1-0386"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DeepNIS: Deep Neural Network for Nonlinear Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering","sourcePdf":"tap-li-2885437-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111754S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8660595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"8660595","articleId":"8565987","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8565993,"authors":[{"name":"Dohyoung Jo","affiliation":["Laboratory of Big-data applications in public sector, Department of urban engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8640274/8565993/jo-2885366-small.gif","p":["Dohyoung Jo is currently working toward graduate degree with the Department of Urban Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea.

To make such systems resilient, we can adopt erasure coding such as Reed-Solomon (RS) code as an alternative to replication because erasure coding incurs a significantly lower storage overhead than replication. To understand the impact of using erasure coding on the system performance and other system aspects such as CPU utilization and network traffic, we build a storage cluster that consists of approximately 100 processor cores with more than 50 high-performance solid-state drives (SSDs), and evaluate the cluster with a popular open-source distributed parallel file system, called Ceph. Specifically, we analyze the behaviors of a system adopting erasure coding from the following five viewpoints, and compare with those of another system using replication: (1) storage system I/O performance; (2) computing and software overheads; (3) I/O amplification; (4) network traffic among storage nodes, and (5) impact of physical data layout on performance of RS-coded SSD arrays. For all these analyses, we examine two representative RS configurations, used by Google file systems, and compare them with triple replication employed by a typical parallel file system as a default fault tolerance mechanism. Lastly, we collect 96 block-level traces from the cluster and release them to the public domain for the use of other researchers.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2018.2884722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2018.2884722","startPage":"1312","endPage":"1330","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/8713946/08565994.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8713946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring Fault-Tolerant Erasure Codes for Scalable All-Flash Array Clusters","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/71/8713946/8565994-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8565994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"Exploring Fault-Tolerant Erasure Codes for Scalable All-Flash Array Clusters","volume":"30","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18670279","publicationDate":"1 June 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8565994/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NRF","grantNumber":"2016R1C1B2015312"},{"fundingName":"Yonsei Future Research","grantNumber":"2017-22-0105, IITP-2017-2017-0-01015 and NRF-2015M3C4A7065645"},{"fundingName":"DOE","grantNumber":"DE-AC02-05CH 11231"},{"fundingName":"MemRay","grantNumber":"2015-11-1731"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1640196 and SRC/NRC NERC 2016-NE-2697-A"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Exploring Fault-Tolerant Erasure Codes for Scalable All-Flash Array Clusters","sourcePdf":"tpds-koh-2884722-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.214463S","chronDate":"June 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"8713946","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8713946","articleId":"8565994","onlineDate":"06 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8565996,"authors":[{"name":"Paul D.

Numerous applications including storage management and somatosensory systems would benefit from accurate passive indoor localization. As a potential technology for the internet of things, radio frequency identification (RFID) has many advantages for indoor localization, such as low cost, parallel processing, and low complexity. In this paper, a passive indoor localization system, named Lobain, was proposed based on interference of ultrahigh frequency RFID tags. Using commercial off-the-shelf reader, antenna, and tags, this system, functions for tagged and tag-free item localization in 2-D and 3-D indoor environments. Small numbers of reference tags were used as sensors to improve performance and reduce cost. Unlike traditional methods, an improved propagation model and an innovative method were presented to extract a target's channel information from a complicated received signal. A relative phase wrapping integer method was presented to solve the phase wrapping problem of reference tags, and the least-squares method was used to optimize the tradeoff between number of reference tags and accuracy. A tag and tag-free items including shrimp chips, cola, and instant noodles were localized as single target in the evaluation experiments.

Therefore, we propose the iterative manifold embedding (IME) layer, of which the weights are learned offline by an unsupervised strategy, to explore the intrinsic manifolds by incomplete data. On the large-scale database that contains 27 000 images, the IME layer is more than 120 times faster than other manifold learning methods to embed the original representations at query time. We embed the original descriptors of database images that lie on manifold in a high-dimensional space into manifold-based representations iteratively to generate the IME representations in an offline learning stage. According to the original descriptors and the IME representations of database images, we estimate the weights of the IME layer by ridge regression. In the online retrieval stage, we employ the IME layer to map the original representation of a query image with an ignorable time cost (2 ms per image). We experiment on five public standard datasets for image retrieval. The proposed IME layer significantly outperforms the related dimension reduction methods and manifold learning methods. Without postprocessing, our IME layer achieves a boost in the performance of state-of-the-art image retrieval methods with postprocessing on most datasets, and needs less computational cost.

However, the secrecy performance of the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) mmWave ultra-dense networks has not been investigated so far. In this paper, we consider the secure communications in downlink SWIPT mmWave ultra-dense networks, where the energy-constrained users extract energy and information from the mmWave signals in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. First, the analytical expressions of the energy-information coverage probability are derived for both power splitting and time switching policies using stochastic geometry. Then, we derive the closed-form expressions of the secrecy probability in the presence of multiple independent or colluding eavesdroppers. Finally, the effective secrecy throughput (EST), which can measure the network energy coverage, secure, and reliable transmission performance in a unified manner, is derived. Theoretical analysis and simulation results reveal that the EST first increases and then decreases with the increasing of the transmit power, power/time splitting ratio, codeword transmission rate, and confidential information rate.

Various plasticity rules have been proposed, among which spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) has gained the highest interest across various neural disciplines, including neuromorphic engineering. Here, we propose highly efficient digital implementations of pair-based STDP (PSTDP) and triplet-based STDP (TSTDP) on field programmable gate arrays that do not require dedicated floating-point multipliers and hence need minimal hardware resources. The implementations are verified by using them to replicate a set of complex experimental data, including those from pair, triplet, quadruplet, frequency-dependent pairing, as well as Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro experiments. We demonstrate that the proposed TSTDP design has a higher operating frequency that leads to 2.46\u00d7 faster weight adaptation (learning) and achieves 11.55 folds improvement in resource usage, compared to a recent implementation of a calcium-based plasticity rule capable of exhibiting similar learning performance. In addition, we show that the proposed PSTDP and TSTDP designs, respectively, consume 2.38\u00d7 and 1.78\u00d7 less resources than the most efficient PSTDP implementation in the literature. As a direct result of the efficiency and powerful synaptic capabilities of the proposed learning modules, they could be integrated into large-scale digital neuromorphic architectures to enable high-performance STDP learning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566143/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","volume":"66","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"18524477","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2019","publicationDate":"April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8566143/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient FPGA Implementations of Pair and Triplet-Based STDP for Neuromorphic Architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient FPGA Implementations of Pair and Triplet-Based STDP for Neuromorphic Architectures","sourcePdf":"tcsi-rahimiazghadi-2881753-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105431S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8667917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8667917","articleId":"8566143","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8566145,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Cong","affiliation":["Center for Domain-Specific Computing, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/8589029/8566145/cong-2876372-small.gif","p":["Jason Cong (Fellow, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in computer science from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 1985 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA, in 1987 and 1990, respectively.","Currently, he is a Distinguished Chancellor\u2019s Professor in the Computer Science Department (and the Electrical Engineering Department with joint appointment), University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA, USA, and a Co-founder, the Chief Scientific Advisory, and the Chairman of Falcon Computing Solutions.","Prof. Cong is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the National Academy of Engineering."]},"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Cong","orcid":"0000-0003-2887-6963","id":"37276009100"},{"name":"Zhenman Fang","affiliation":["Center for Domain-Specific Computing, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/8589029/8566145/fang-2876372-small.gif","p":["Zhenman Fang (Member, IEEE) received the joint B.S. degree in software engineering from Fudan University, Shanghai, China and in computer science from University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Fudan University in 2014.","From 2014 to 2017, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA, USA, in the Center for Domain-Specific Computing and Center for Future Architectures Research.

We believe that future computing systems will be customizable with extensive use of accelerators, as custom-designed accelerators often provide 10-100X performance/energy efficiency over the general-purpose processors. Such an accelerator-rich architecture presents a fundamental departure from the classical von Neumann architecture, which emphasizes efficient sharing of the executions of different instructions on a common pipeline, providing an elegant solution when the computing resource is scarce. In contrast, the accelerator-rich architecture features heterogeneity and customization for energy efficiency; this is better suited for energy-constrained designs where the silicon resource is abundant and spatial computing is favored-which has been the case with the end of Dennard scaling. Currently, customizable computing has garnered great interest; for example, this is evident by Intel's $17 billion acquisition of Altera in 2015 and Amazon's introduction of field-programmable gate-arrays (FPGAs) in its AWS public cloud. In this paper, we present an overview of the research programs and accomplishments of CDSC on customizable computing, from single chip to server node and to datacenters, with extensive use of composable accelerators and FPGAs. We highlight our successes in several application domains, such as medical imaging, machine learning, and computational genomics. In addition to architecture innovations, an equally important research dimension enables automation for customized computing. This includes automated compilation for combining source-code-level transformation for high-level synthesis with efficient parameterized architecture template generations, and efficient runtime support for scheduling and transparent resource management for integration of FPGAs for datacenter-scale acceleration with support to the existing programming interfaces, such as MapReduce, Hadoop, and Spark, for large-scale distributed computation. We will present the latest progress in these areas, and also discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5/8589029/8566145-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566145/","volume":"107","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8566145/","accessionNumber":"18339647","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Customizable Computing\u2014From Single Chip to Datacenters","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1436827"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007053","fundingName":"Mentor Graphics"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation"},{"fundingName":"MARCO and DARPA"},{"fundingName":"Intel and NSF joint research center for Computer Assisted Programming for Heterogeneous Architectures (CAPA)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Customizable Computing\u2014From Single Chip to Datacenters","sourcePdf":"jproc-cong-2876372-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153713S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"8589029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8589029","articleId":"8566145","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8566147,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Spasaro","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"],"bio":{"p":["Michele Spasaro (S\u201911) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees (cum laude) in electrical and telecommunications engineering from the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Perugia, Italy, in 2010 and 2017, respectively.

The characteristics of microblog (e.g., short text, full noise, casual expression, and incomplete grammatical structure) bring new challenges to microblog text subjectivity classification task. The existing subjectivity classification approaches of microblog text mainly depend on the techniques of artificially constructing emotional features that are commonly based on the bag-of-words model, which will lead to the curse of dimensionality and data sparsity problem. Furthermore, microblog text usually contains the left-handed compliment or implicit representation. It is difficult to find and describe this implicit semantic representation by artificially constructing emotional features, which seriously affects the subjectivity classification accuracy. To address these problems, we introduce a deep recurrent convolution neural network model for subjectivity classification of microblog text with the multi-features combination. In our model, we apply the convolution neural networks to automatically learn classification features and use the recurrent neural networks to abstract and memorize the sequence semantic relations of microblog text. We also employ pre-trained word embedding to reduce the representation dimension of the text, which avoids dimension disasters and data sparsity issues. We perform experiments on six commonly used Twitter datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on several datasets. Compared with the baseline methods, the accuracy and the average F1-measure of our proposed model for subjectivity classification are improved by a minimum of 1.21% and 2.82%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885362","startPage":"347","endPage":"357","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08566159.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring Deep Recurrent Convolution Neural Networks for Subjectivity Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566159/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Exploring Deep Recurrent Convolution Neural Networks for Subjectivity Classification","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8566159/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61762058 and 61861024"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Project of Gansu Province","grantNumber":"1610RJZA056"},{"fundingName":"Key Laboratory Opening Project of Opto-Technology and Intelligent Control (Ministry of Education)","grantNumber":"KFKT2016-7"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010249","fundingName":"Youth Science Foundation of Lanzhou Jiaotong University","grantNumber":"2014026"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Exploring Deep Recurrent Convolution Neural Networks for Subjectivity Classification","sourcePdf":"access-xuejun-2885362-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126463S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8566159","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8566160,"authors":[{"name":"Wenkun Xiang","affiliation":["School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8566160/xiang-2885350-small.gif","p":["Wenkun Xiang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in software engineering from Yunnan University, in 2015 and 2018, respectively.

However, the application of machine learning as a potential alternative for the traditional data structures, especially using deep learning, is a relatively new and largely uncharted territory. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent neural network-based learned inverted index, called Pavo, to efficiently and flexibly organize inverted data. The basic hash function in the traditional inverted index is replaced by a hierarchical neural network, which makes Pavo be able to well adapt for various data distributions while showing lower collision rate as well as higher space utilization rate. A particular feature of our approach is that a novel unsupervised learning strategy to construct the hash function is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, there are no similar results, in which the unsupervised learning strategy is employed to design hash functions, in the existing literature. Extensive experimental results show that the unsupervised model owns some advantages than the supervised one. Our approaches not only demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning-based data structures for index purpose but also provide benefits for developers to make more accurate decisions on both the design and the configuration of data organization, operation, and parameters tuning of neural network so as to improve the performance of information searching.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Neural networks","Data structures","Unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Learning index","RNN","hash function","LSTM"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885350","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08566160.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pavo: A RNN-Based Learned Inverted Index, Supervised or Unsupervised?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8566160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pavo: A RNN-Based Learned Inverted Index, Supervised or Unsupervised?","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566160/","volume":"7","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","htmlLink":"/document/8566160/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61762089, 61663047, 61863036 and 61762092"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Innovation Team Project of Yunnan Province","grantNumber":"2017HC012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Pavo: A RNN-Based Learned Inverted Index, Supervised or Unsupervised?","sourcePdf":"access-zhou-2885350-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073297S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8566160","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8566163,"authors":[{"name":"Jintao Ke","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/8892698/8566163/ke-2882861-small.gif","p":["Jintao Ke received the B.S. degree in civil engineering from Zhejiang University.

With real-time information from both drivers and passengers, the ride-sourcing platform can reduce matching frictions and improve efficiencies by surge pricing, optimal vehicle-trip assignment, and proactive ridesplitting strategies. An important foundation of these strategies is the short-term supply-demand forecasting. In this paper, we tackle the problem of predicting the short-term supply-demand gap of ride-sourcing services. In contrast to the previous studies that partitioned a city area into numerous square lattices, we partition the city area into various regular hexagon lattices, which is motivated by the fact that hexagonal segmentation has an unambiguous neighborhood definition, smaller edge-to-area ratio, and isotropy. To capture the spatio-temporal characteristics in a hexagonal manner, we propose three hexagon-based convolutional neural networks (H-CNN), both the input and output of which are numerous local hexagon maps. Moreover, a hexagon-based ensemble mechanism is developed to enhance the prediction performance. Validated by a 3-week real-world ride-sourcing dataset in Guangzhou, China, the H-CNN models are found to significantly outperform the benchmark algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness. Our approaches can be further extended to a broad range of spatio-temporal forecasting problems in the domain of shared mobility and urban computing.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/8892698/08566163.pdf","startPage":"4160","endPage":"4173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2018.2882861","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2018.2882861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8892698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hexagon-Based Convolutional Neural Network for Supply-Demand Forecasting of Ride-Sourcing Services","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"Hexagon-Based Convolutional Neural Network for Supply-Demand Forecasting of Ride-Sourcing Services","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566163/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8566163/","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2019","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","accessionNumber":"19132904","volume":"20","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong\u2019s Research Grants Council","grantNumber":"HKUST16222916"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"LR17E080002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51508505, 71771198 and 51338008"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002663","fundingName":"Northwestern Polytechnical University","grantNumber":"2017QNA4025"},{"fundingName":"Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang","grantNumber":"2018C01007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hexagon-Based Convolutional Neural Network for Supply-Demand Forecasting of Ride-Sourcing Services","sourcePdf":"tits-chen-2882861-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.194416S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"8892698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8892698","articleId":"8566163","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8566169,"authors":[{"name":"Jingying Li","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8752485/8566169/li-2884219-small.gif","p":["Jingying Li received the B.S. degree in automation and the M.S. degree in control science and engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

A general bioinspired nonlinear structure, which can present ideal nonlinear quasi-zero stiffness for vibration isolation, is adopted as tracking reference model. Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate unknown nonlinear terms in nonlinear suspension systems. Particularly, a nonlinear damping is designed to improve damping characteristics of the bioinspired reference model. With beneficial nonlinear stiffness and improved nonlinear damping of the bioinspired reference model, the proposed fuzzy adaptive controller can effectively suppress vibration of suspension systems with less actuator force and much improved ride comfort, thus energy saving performance can be achieved. Finally, a quarter-vehicle active suspension system with considering payload uncertainties, general disturbance, and actuator saturation is provided for evaluating the validity and superiority of the

quarter-rate two finite impulse response tap direct decision feedback equalizer (DFE) is presented. For a high-speed incorporated operation of both DFE summing and slicing, a common-mode-controlled charge-based latch (CMCCBL) is proposed. In a CMCCBL-based DFE, the common mode of the first tap feedback signal is changed to adjust the first tap feedback weight. Therefore, CMCCBL does not need the conventional first tap weighting transistors which increase the DFE feedback delay. The DFE core compensates for the FR4 printed circuit board channel loss of -22 dB at 6 GHz and consumes 4.16 mW achieving 0.347 pJ/bit for PRBS7 input.

To improve the safety and adaptiveness of robots in performing complex movement tasks, a novel method called covariance matrix adaptation-evolution strategies (CMA-ES) for learning complex and high-dimensional motor skills is presented. Considering the complex motion model of trajectories, dynamic movement primitives (DMPs), which is a generic method for trajectories modeling in attractor landscape based on differential dynamic systems, is used to represent the robot's trajectories. CMA-ES offers a theoretical rule for updating the parameters of DMPs and a variable impedance controller, which can reduce the impact of noisy environment on the robot's movement. In this paper, we propose two hierarchies for controlling the robot: the high-level neural-dynamic network optimization for redundancy resolution in task space and the low-level CMA-ES fusing with DMPs for learning trajectories in joint space. In this paper, CMA-ES method is explored to learn variable impedance control and the performance of the proposed method in learning the robot's movements is also tested.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2018.2884240","startPage":"7788","endPage":"7799","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2018.2884240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8728044","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8728044/08566177.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolution Strategies Learning With Variable Impedance Control for Grasping Under Uncertainty","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566177/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolution Strategies Learning With Variable Impedance Control for Grasping Under Uncertainty","volume":"66","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8566177/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18725718","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"03 June 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSFC Shenzhen Robotics Research Center Project","grantNumber":"U1613219"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Overseas Innovation and Entrepreneurship Research Program","grantNumber":"KQJSCX20170731164301774"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Technology Project","grantNumber":"JSGG20160301160759264"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolution Strategies Learning With Variable Impedance Control for Grasping Under Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"tie-wu-2884240-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073111S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8728044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8728044","articleId":"8566177","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8566180,"authors":[{"name":"Niranjan M.

We label the link that reuses the CP-intervals as CPLink, as they use only the CP-intervals of the ongoing link labeled, MainLink. We leverage the fact that the most commonly used OFDM receivers discard the samples in CP-intervals to design the CPLink that ensures below-noise-floor interference at every MainLink-receiver. The key contribution in this paper is the design and study of zero-knowledge CPLink, in which the CPLink-transmitter ensures below-noise-floor interference at every MainLink-receiver with no knowledge about the locations or the number of MainLink-receivers. We analytically show that the zero-knowledge CPLink capacity is positive. For LTE frame structure with 20-MHz bandwidth and 2-km cell-radius, we evaluate the CPLink for two kinds of CPLink-receivers: full-duplex base-station and a half-duplex device. Even for the cell-edge CPLink-transmitters, full-duplex zero-knowledge CPLink data rates can be up to 20 Mbps (60 Mbps) when the CP duration is ~7% (25%) of the data-symbol duration. The half-duplex CPLink rate is 5-40 Mbps when the CPLink-transmitter is within 250 m of CPLink-receiver. CPLink capacity is found to increase near-linearly with the CP duration, thus mitigating CP overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2018.2883946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless

Although a wealth of healthcare information is available in OHCs, consumers find it challenging to locate information of interest efficiently due to the information overload. The lack of medical knowledge and searching skills makes it even harder for consumers to retrieve demanded information from a popular OHC with hundreds of thousands of threads. Therefore, effective thread recommendation is critical for OHCs to enhance user experience and engage the users in the community. In this paper, we proposed to recommend threads to users in OHCs by exploiting heterogeneous healthcare information network mining. We first constructed a heterogeneous healthcare information network from OHCs data. Unlike bipartite graphs studied in most existing works, which only consider user nodes and item nodes, a heterogeneous healthcare information network retains the rich context information of users and threads. We extracted features from the network to capture basic network metrics, thread-thread relationship, and user-user relationship, and utilize the features to train a binary classification model for thread recommendation. Experiments were conducted using a data set collected from MedHelp. The proposed approach was proven to be effective in measuring user interests in online discussion threads. In addition, by testing our approaches using different settings, we found that the local similarity achieved better performance than the global similarity in heterogeneous information network. By incorporating thread- thread relationship and user-user relationship, it can achieve the best performance.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6570650/8566185/8566221-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566221/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18561913","htmlLink":"/document/8566221/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2018","volume":"5","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Enriching User Experience in Online Health Communities Through Thread Recommendations and Heterogeneous Information Network Mining","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"NSF-1741306, IIS-1650531 and DIBBs-1443019"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Enriching User Experience in Online Health Communities Through Thread Recommendations and Heterogeneous Information Network Mining","sourcePdf":"tcss-yang-2879044-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109543S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6570650","isNumber":"8566185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570650","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8566185","articleId":"8566221","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8566243,"authors":[{"name":"Fazeleh Tavassolian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bu-Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran"],"firstName":"Fazeleh","lastName":"Tavassolian","id":"37086544459"},{"name":"Hassan Khotanlou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bu-Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Khotanlou","id":"37294421500"},{"name":"Payam Varshovi-Jaghargh","affiliation":["Department of Robotics Engineering, Hamedan University of Technology, Hamedan, Iran"],"firstName":"Payam","lastName":"Varshovi-Jaghargh","id":"37086543880"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9569-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9570-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2375-1304"}],"articleNumber":"8566243","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel robots","Biological neural networks","Kinematics","Classification algorithms","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion control","neurocontrollers","robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward kinematics problem","neural network based solution","3-PRR planar parallel robot","forward kinematics analysis","loop structure","circular motion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forward Kinematics Problem","Planar Parallel Robot","Neural Network","ECOC Classifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8566243","abstract":"Forward kinematics problem has always been a controversial topic in the case of parallel robots because of the close loop structure and the complicated nonlinear system of equations.

In this approach, the robot's workspace is segmented into several subspaces for improving the accuracy of the solutions. Then, the pose of the parallel robot is precisely estimated using a neural network for each subspace. In order to determine the validity of this approach, the circular motion of a 3-PRR planar parallel robot is simulated by applying the proposed method.

Convolutional neural networks among all deep learning methods are very popular in image analysis fields, but they cannot be used for point cloud because of point cloud's irregular format and unordered instinct. In this paper we adapted kernel correlation, a technique widely used in point clouds registration field, in order to develop a CNN -like method which extracts local information from point clouds.

Recently, many papers have been published on application of STLF using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Input data selection, normalization method and the number of hidden neurons are very important factors in modeling ANNs. In order to improve the accuracy of STLF using ANNs, several input data selections and various input data normalization methods are analyzed. The past load, the past temperature and the temperature of the forecasting day are used as input data for STLF. In the case studies, the accuracy of forecasting in ANNs with various normalization methods and several input data selections are compared. Result of case studies show that the accuracy of STLF is good when using the maximum-minimum normalization and using the input data selection of recent two days.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2018.8566293","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540786/8566238/08566293.pdf","startPage":"280","endPage":"283","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2018.8566293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8566238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Short-Term Load Forecasting Using Artificial Neural Network Algorithm According to Normalization and Selection of Input Data on Weekdays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Short-Term Load Forecasting Using Artificial Neural Network Algorithm According to Normalization and Selection of Input Data on Weekdays","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18308266","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8566293/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Short-Term Load Forecasting Using Artificial Neural Network Algorithm According to Normalization and Selection of Input Data on Weekdays","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"Day2_TS08_5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046846S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540786","isNumber":"8566238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540786","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8566238","articleId":"8566293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8566424,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Serajeh","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, K.N.

There are three different auction types, such as sequential auctions, parallel auctions, and combinatorial auctions. This study focuses on combinatorial auctions. Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to bid on a collection of items rather than a single item. This results in more efficient allocations than traditional auctions. The problem is determining the winners of all bids in a way that maximizes the auctioneer's profit. Some instances of the problem may be solvable in polynomial time with a few items and bidders. However, with excessive numbers of items and bidders, the problem becomes NP-complete. In this paper, a genetic algorithm is proposed and compared with a random search algorithm on various sized datasets. The results for experiments indicate that the proposed genetic algorithm performs better than random search as the size of the problem increases.","doi":"10.1109/UBMK.2018.8566446","startPage":"127","endPage":"132","publicationTitle":"2018 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering (UBMK)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UBMK.2018.8566446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8566244","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering (UBMK)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8520559/8566244/08566446.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm for the Winner Determination Problem in Combinatorial Auctions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566446/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm for the Winner Determination Problem in Combinatorial Auctions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8566446/","accessionNumber":"18308141","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm for the Winner Determination Problem in Combinatorial Auctions","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"423-Genetic-Algorithm-Uzunbayir.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063177S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8520559","isNumber":"8566244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8520559","xplore-issue":"8566244","articleId":"8566446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8566449,"authors":[{"name":"Emre \u015ea\u015fmaz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, I\u015flk University, \u0130stanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"\u015ea\u015fmaz","id":"37086075851"},{"name":"F.

This paper presents a novel multi-step ahead wind power prediction model based on recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) unit or gated recurrent unit (GRU) to improve the accuracy. Firstly, an overall forecasting framework for wind power with diverse forms of optional hybrid models is proposed. Moreover, an innovative LSTM/GRU-based forecasting model is developed with a wind speed correction process using numerical weather prediction (NWP) data. Through the application of GRU network, the correction process can provide corrected wind speed at the predicted moment as an input of the forecasting model. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RNN approaches as compared to the ARIMA method and SVM method while the main distinctions between the LSTM and GRU network are also illustrated.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2018.8566471","startPage":"217","endPage":"222","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2018.8566471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8566238","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540786/8566238/08566471.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-step Ahead Wind Power Forecasting Based on Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566471/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-step Ahead Wind Power Forecasting Based on Recurrent Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8566471/","accessionNumber":"18324013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-step Ahead Wind Power Forecasting Based on Recurrent Neural Networks","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"Day1_TS06_6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112481S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540786","isNumber":"8566238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540786","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8566238","articleId":"8566471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8566474,"authors":[{"name":"Longfu Luo","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Longfu","lastName":"Luo","id":"37291401000"},{"name":"Yafei Yan","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yafei","lastName":"Yan","id":"37086543210"},{"name":"Zhao Huang","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086544437"},{"name":"Ziyi Bai","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ziyi","lastName":"Bai","id":"37086544781"},{"name":"Zhenhua Rao","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhenhua","lastName":"Rao","id":"37086546845"},{"name":"Ye Tian","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Tian","id":"37086546814"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5686-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5685-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5687-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8566474","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8566474","abstract":"In order to improve the power quality of 220kV transformer substations in power system, the harmonic currents on the 110kV and 35kV sides can flow into the superconducting loop which is composed of the inductive filter winding of four-winding inductive filter transformer and the inductive filter device, and thus the currents on 220kV side are pollute-less. The parameters of inductive filter device in the loop is the key to affect the entire filtering performance. Therefore, an immune genetic algorithm(IGA) of improved operator is applied to optimize the design of inductive filter device in this paper, which uses the total investment cost of the device, the reactive power compensation and the filtering performance as the optimized objectives. Besides the ability of global searching of the genetic algorithm(GA), the IGA involves the mechanisms of immune system such as memory cell and antibody diversity-keeping. By updating the memory cell bank and dynamically adjusting the immune function through the improved operator, the convergent speed of the IGA is accelerated and the global optimal solution is obtained. Simulation results show that the IGA is more effective than the traditional algorithm(TA) for optimizing the design of the inductive filter device.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2018.8566474","startPage":"475","endPage":"480","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540786/8566238/08566474.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2018.8566474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8566238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Inductive Filter Device Design for a Novel Transformer Based on Improved Immune Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power harmonic filters","Passive filters","Windings","Harmonic analysis","Filtering algorithms","Reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","power supply quality","transformer substations","transformer windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized inductive filter device design","memory cell bank","antibody diversity-keeping","reactive power compensation","four-winding inductive filter transformer","inductive filter winding","superconducting loop","transformer substations","power quality","immune genetic algorithm","voltage 220.0 kV","voltage 35.0 kV","voltage 110.0 kV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["inductive filtering","four-winding inductive filter transformer","immune genetic algorithm","passive filter","power quality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Inductive Filter Device Design for a Novel Transformer Based on Improved Immune Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8566474/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18324010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Inductive Filter Device Design for a Novel Transformer Based on Improved Immune Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"Day2_TS12_8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074937S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540786","isNumber":"8566238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540786","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8566238","articleId":"8566474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8566478,"authors":[{"name":"A Shamsul Rahimi A Subki","affiliation":["Department of Electronic & Computer Eng.

and maintains the classification performance above an acceptable threshold. A hybrid model called Discrete Wavelet Transform Singular Value Decomposition based Perceptual Hash Convolutional Neural Network (DWT-SVD-PH-CNN) is proposed by using a perceptual hash function together with CNN to reduce the classification time. In the proposed method, the DWT-SVD- based perceptual hash function is used. The most important feature of perceptual hash functions is to obtain the salient features of images. First, DWT-SVD based perceptual hash function is applied to images for obtaining salient features. Then, images making up of salient features, are produced in 32 x 32 format and given as inputs to CNN, where Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify the images. In this paper, the DWT-SVD-PH-CNN method is applied to Caltech 101 image database. Experimental results show that the proposed DWT-SVD-PH-CNN method has a high accuracy, about 95.8 %. Moreover, this method reduces the execution time from 241.21 seconds to 83.08 seconds compared to the classical method. Thus, the experimental results show that the proposed DWT-SVD-PH-CNN method performs much faster than classical CNN by maintaining the image classification accuracy high.","doi":"10.1109/UBMK.2018.8566537","startPage":"410","endPage":"413","publicationTitle":"2018 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering (UBMK)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UBMK.2018.8566537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8566244","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering (UBMK)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8520559/8566244/08566537.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Method for Classification of Images Using Convolutional Neural Network Based on Dwt-Svd Perceptual Hash Function","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566537/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Method for Classification of Images Using Convolutional Neural Network Based on Dwt-Svd Perceptual Hash Function","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8566537/","accessionNumber":"18308176","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Method for Classification of Images Using Convolutional Neural Network Based on Dwt-Svd Perceptual Hash Function","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"546-New-Method-Ozyurt.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054639S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8520559","isNumber":"8566244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8520559","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8566244","articleId":"8566537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8566571,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Pashaei","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical and Computer Science, Amirkabir University of Technology a."],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Pashaei","id":"37089138481"},{"name":"Hedieh Sajedi","affiliation":["College of Science, University of Tehran"],"firstName":"Hedieh","lastName":"Sajedi","id":"37393621000"},{"name":"Niloofar Jazayeri","affiliation":["College of Science, University of Tehran"],"firstName":"Niloofar","lastName":"Jazayeri","id":"37086546722"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9569-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9570-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2375-1304"}],"articleNumber":"8566571","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":599},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8566571","abstract":"Tumor identification is one of the main and most influential factors in the identification of the type of treatment, the treatment process, the success rate of treatment and the follow-up of the disease. Convolution neural networks are one of the most important and practical classes in the field of deep learning and feed-forward neural networks that is highly applicable for analyzing visual imagery. CNNs learn the features extracted by the convolution and maxpooling layers. Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) are a kind of learning algorithm that consists of one or more layers of hidden nodes. These networks are used in various fields such as classification and regression. By using a CNN, this paper tries to extract hidden features from images. Then a kernel ELM (KELM) classifies the images based on these extracted features. In this work, we will use a dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which consists of three types of brain tumors including meningioma, glioma and pituitary tumor in T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) images. The results of this ensemble of CNN and KELM (KE-CNN) are compared with different classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Radial Base Function, and some other classifiers. These comparisons show that the KE-CNN has promising results for brain tumor classification.","doi":"10.1109/ICCKE.2018.8566571","startPage":"314","endPage":"319","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 8th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8552256/8566242/08566571.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 8th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCKE.2018.8566571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8566242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brain Tumor Classification via Convolutional Neural Network and Extreme Learning Machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tumors","Feature extraction","Convolution","Classification algorithms","Biological neural networks","Support vector machines","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","brain","diseases","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image classification","image enhancement","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","multilayer perceptrons","neural nets","support vector machines","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tumor identification","main factors","most influential factors","treatment process","convolution neural networks","practical classes","deep learning","feed-forward neural networks","maxpooling layers","extreme learning machines","learning algorithm","hidden features","glioma","pituitary tumor","T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI images","KE-CNN","Support Vector Machine","brain tumor classification","convolutional neural network","image regression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["convolution neural network","extreme machine learning","brain tumor classification","deep learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Brain Tumor Classification via Convolutional Neural Network and Extreme Learning Machines","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8566571/","publicationDate":"October 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"25-26 Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18309470","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brain Tumor Classification via Convolutional Neural Network and Extreme Learning Machines","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053463S","chronDate":"25-26 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8552256","isNumber":"8566242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8552256","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8566242","articleId":"8566571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8566586,"authors":[{"name":"DC Hapuarachchi","affiliation":["Transmission and Generation Planning, Ceylon Electricity Board, Colombo, Sri Lanka"],"firstName":"DC","lastName":"Hapuarachchi","id":"37086542924"},{"name":"KTMU Hemapala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Colombo, Sri Lanka"],"firstName":"KTMU","lastName":"Hemapala","id":"38234747600"},{"name":"AGBP Jayasekara","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Colombo, Sri Lanka"],"firstName":"AGBP","lastName":"Jayasekara","id":"37586989200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5686-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5685-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5687-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8566586","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8566586","abstract":"Electricity has become a major form of end use energy in present complex society.

Actions","abstract":"Nowadays, with the advent of phasor measurement units, control center operators can evaluate and monitor online the status of power systems small signal stability. In operation of power systems conditions may arise that traditional controllers cannot damp electromechanical oscillations. In these situations corrective actions can be used to suppress the oscillations. Corrective actions should be analyzed and evaluated before applying to the system. This paper investigates the effect of line switching as a corrective action on damping inter-area modes via a new algorithm which is based on calculation of first order sensitivity coefficients. The proposed method characterizes the effect of changing load flow pattern as well as topology of the network due to the line transmission switching on displacement of the inter-area mode. The 10-bus two-area test system is used to examine performance of the proposed method.

Automatic methods for classification of plant diseases also help taking action after detecting the symptoms of leaf diseases. This paper presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm based method for tomato leaf disease detection and classification. The dataset contains 500 images of tomato leaves with four symptoms of diseases. We have modeled a CNN for automatic feature extraction and classification. Color information is actively used for plant leaf disease researches. In our model, the filters are applied to three channels based on RGB components. The LVQ has been fed with the output feature vector of convolution part for training the network. The experimental results validate that the proposed method effectively recognizes four different types of tomato leaf diseases.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering (UBMK)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8520559/8566244/08566635.pdf","startPage":"382","endPage":"385","publicationTitle":"2018 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering (UBMK)","doi":"10.1109/UBMK.2018.8566635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UBMK.2018.8566635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8566244","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8566635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Plant Leaf Disease Detection and Classification Based on CNN with LVQ Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diseases","Feature extraction","Convolution","Biological system modeling","Microorganisms","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agriculture","convolution","crops","diseases","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image classification","image colour analysis","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","plant diseases","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bacterial spot","late blight","septoria leaf spot","yellow curved leaf diseases","plant diseases","CNN","tomato leaf disease detection","automatic feature extraction","plant leaf disease detection","LVQ algorithm","crop yield","plant leaf disease classification","agriculture","convolutional neural network model","learning vector quantization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Leaf Disease Detection","Leaf Disease Classification","Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)","Learning Vector Quantization(LVQ)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Plant Leaf Disease Detection and Classification Based on CNN with LVQ Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8566635/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18308121","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Plant Leaf Disease Detection and Classification Based on CNN with LVQ Algorithm","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"529-Plant-Leaf-Sardogan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041634S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8520559","isNumber":"8566244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8520559","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8566244","articleId":"8566635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8566685,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d6mer Faruk Nasip","affiliation":["Tokat Gaziosmanpa\u015fa \u00dcniversitesi, Mekatronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi Anabilim Dal\u0131, Tokat, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"\u00d6mer Faruk","lastName":"Nasip"},{"name":"Kenan Zengin","affiliation":["Tokat Gaziosmanpa\u015fa \u00dcniversitesi, Bilgisayar M\u00fchendisli\u011fi Anabilim Dal\u0131, Tokat, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"Kenan","lastName":"Zengin"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4184-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4185-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8566685","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Microorganisms","Convolutional neural networks","Matlab","Digital images","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","convolution","data analysis","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","microorganisms","multilayer perceptrons","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classification process","multilayer neural networks","deep learning","bacteria species","hierarchical learning","convolutional neural network","bacteria classification","DIBaS data set","MATLAB environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep learning","classification","VggNet","AlexNet"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8566685","abstract":"Deep learning, also called hierarchical learning, aims to analyze the structure of input data from simple to complex with the help of multi-layer neural networks.

The growth in technology fosters the developments of varies gadgets but this growth has also been harnessed by intruders to develop new and more sophisticated ways of breaking into a network, hence the need for continual research in developing more sophisticated methods that can detect new day attacks in a various types of networks. Different algorithms have been used in building network security systems; however, in spite of their effectiveness, these algorithms also have different disadvantages that reduce its performance. A major way of improving the performance is through feature selection. This research focuses on how feature selection methods can be used to improve the performance of the minimum distance classifier using the UNB/IDS 2012 dataset. The performance of the classifier is optimized using two basic feature selection methods: entropy and variance, then a k-fold cross validation is performed to validate the accuracy results.","doi":"10.1109/ISMSIT.2018.8566694","publicationTitle":"2018 2nd International Symposium on Multidisciplinary Studies and Innovative Technologies (ISMSIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 2nd International Symposium on Multidisciplinary Studies and Innovative Technologies (ISMSIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543123/8566679/08566694.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMSIT.2018.8566694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8566679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Entropy-Based Feature Selection for Network Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8566694","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566694/","displayDocTitle":"Entropy-Based Feature Selection for Network Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18309177","htmlLink":"/document/8566694/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entropy-Based Feature Selection for Network Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Ankara, Turkey","sourcePdf":"PID5602575.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070671S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543123","isNumber":"8566679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543123","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8566679","articleId":"8566694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8566706,"authors":[{"name":"Michel Saideh","affiliation":["Univ.

Particle Swarm Optimization in the Design of Halbach Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generators for Megawatt Level Wind Turbines","abstract":"In this paper particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimize a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) for use in megawatt level wind turbines. The PMSG unitizes Halbach Array as the arrangement of choice for its surface mounted rare earth magnetic pole pieces. Halbach array is expected to produce the same amount of flux density with less magnet mass than conventional array. The PMSG will be directly driven; therefore, it is expected to be large, heavy, and expensive. The aim of this research is to utilize Halbach array and PSO as means to reduce the cost and size of wind turbine direct-driven PMSGs. Machine dimensions and characteristics are outlined as well as the optimization process. The optimization process is run with three different optimization goals to produce three different Halbach PMSGs. First, the objective function is designed to reduce cost alone. PSO is to work with machine dimensional parameters to produce as low cost as possible a machine with as small a size without compromising basic design and electromagnetic requirements expected from such machines. Second, the objective function will then be adjusted to offer optimization with emphasis on efficiency as well as cost, and new results would be produced. finally, the optimization goal is readjusted again to optimize for efficiency alone regardless of the initial cost. Therefore, three differently optimized Halbach PMSGs are outlined, discussed, and compared in this paper, which highlights the capabilities of the optimization method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566736/","accessionNumber":"18324178","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8566736/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of Particle Swarm Optimization in the Design of Halbach Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generators for Megawatt Level Wind Turbines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Particle Swarm Optimization in the Design of Halbach Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generators for Megawatt Level Wind Turbines","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"296-Kuwait-App-Alshbni.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049382S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540960","isNumber":"8566698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540960","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8566698","articleId":"8566736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8566822,"authors":[{"name":"Salah Eddine RHAILI","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Mohammadia School of Engineering (EMI), Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Salah Eddine","lastName":"RHAILI","id":"37086127370"},{"name":"Ahmed ABBOU","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Mohammadia School of Engineering (EMI), Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"ABBOU","id":"37540707800"},{"name":"Nezha EL HICHAMI","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Mohammadia School of Engineering (EMI), Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Nezha EL","lastName":"HICHAMI","id":"37086130345"},{"name":"Saloua MARHRAOUI","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Mohammadia School of Engineering (EMI), Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Saloua","lastName":"MARHRAOUI","id":"37085864228"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5982-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5981-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5983-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2572-6013"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2377-6897"}],"articleNumber":"8566822","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Wind turbines","Torque","Wind speed","Generators","Wind energy","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular velocity control","maximum power point trackers","neurocontrollers","permanent magnet generators","photovoltaic power systems","PI control","power generation control","synchronous generators","wind power plants","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks MPPT controller","variable-speed wind turbine","advanced control system","wind energy conversion","offline mode","neural network parameters","optimal neural network controller","activation function","online mode","optimal ANN controller","five-phase PMSG based wind turbine system","required data","ANN model","conventional PI controller","controller inputs","ANN output","wind speed values","artificial neural network controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Five-phase","multiphase","five-phase PMSG","permanent magnet generator control","Variable speed control","speed control","artificial intelligence","new algorithm","wind speed","turbine","Artificial Neural Network","ANN","contribution","new approac","WECS control","wind turbine","MPPT controller","ANN Training and testing","fixed step size","adaptive step size","generator speed direction","speed tracking","Mechanical power"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8566822","abstract":"The present paper investigates an advanced control system of the wind energy conversion using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) controller, which is developed in two modes: the offline mode, required for testing different sets of neural network parameters to find the optimal neural network controller (structure, activation function, and training algorithm), and the online mode where the optimal ANN controller is used in the five-phase PMSG based wind turbine system. The required data to generate the ANN model is obtained from a conventional PI controller. The controller inputs are the error between reference and actual speed (e), and the error change (de = e(k)-e(k-1)). As for the ANN output, it is the decreasing or increasing electromagnetic torque (dTe*). The studied neural network controller has been tested and validated using different wind speed values.

The outputs of two LLC resonant converters are connected in series. One of the LLC resonant converters is operated at the resonant frequency, which is the highest efficiency operation point. The magnetic control is adopted for the second LLC resonant converter to fulfill the closed-loop control of charge voltage and current for constant voltage (CV) and constant current (CC) charge modes. The proposed topology can achieve zero voltage switching (ZVS) for all primary switches and zero current switching (ZCS) for all secondary diodes during both CC and CV modes. Furthermore, thanks to constant frequency operation, the electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter design is simplified. Simulation and experimental studies are presented to verify the feasibility and validity of the proposed topology.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 7th International Conference on Renewable Energy

multi-layer artificial neural networks, with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The meteorological data are used as input variables. Due to the random nature of the meteorological variables, this forecast is necessary in order to plan the energy resources on the short-term. The forecast horizon is fixed at ten minutes. A data analysis with the WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) software permitted to select three input parameters (maximum temperature, mean radiation and time) among the nine measured and to determine four hidden layers. A comparative study is realized between the measured solar radiation on the site and the forecast results. The forecasted and measured data are correlated at 99% with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0362, a time-statistical error of 9.25 and a normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of 19.37%.

Each photovoltaic (PV) module has nameplate values defined under STC. PV module can be measured indoor under STC, but it is difficult to measure under STC in outdoors, because the output power of PV module is greatly affected by solar radiation and temperature. In this study, I-V curves under STC and dark conditions were calculated by using only nameplate values. Irradiance, module temperature and these I-V curves are used for drawing reference I-V curve. One diode model equation was used for the calculation of these I-V curves. This paper used PV Module irradiance Sensor (PVMS) in outdoor experiment. By using calculated I-V curves, linear interpolation method and temperature correction were applied in order to create reference I-V curve to the experimental condition. The I-V curve after temperature correction was used as a reference. Then, reference I-V curve was compared with experiment values in outdoor as the correct value. The power generation performance of the PV module is evaluated by two curves error. Three conditions of irradiances between high irradiance and low irradiance were selected as experimental conditions. As a result, reference I-V curve was calculated about within 3% precision.","doi":"10.1109/ICRERA.2018.8566877","publicationTitle":"2018 7th International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications (ICRERA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 7th International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications (ICRERA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540960/8566698/08566877.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRERA.2018.8566877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8566698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of power generation performance using only the nameplate value using linear interpolation method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8566877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566877/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of power generation performance using only the nameplate value using linear interpolation method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18324249","htmlLink":"/document/8566877/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of power generation performance using only the nameplate value using linear interpolation method","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"111-Japan-Evaluation-Kawasaki.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0633S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540960","isNumber":"8566698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540960","xplore-issue":"8566698","articleId":"8566877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8566884,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Salman Fakhar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Salman","lastName":"Fakhar","id":"37086545933"},{"name":"Syed Abdul Rehman Kashif","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Syed Abdul","lastName":"Rehman Kashif","id":"37086543402"},{"name":"Muhammad Asghar Saqib","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Asghar","lastName":"Saqib","id":"37294081600"},{"name":"Farhan Mehmood","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Farhan","lastName":"Mehmood","id":"37086547186"},{"name":"Hafiz Zaheer Hussain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, NESPAK, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Hafiz Zaheer","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37085677726"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0922-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0921-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0923-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-3923"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2150-3915"}],"articleNumber":"8566884","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Particle swarm optimization","Convergence","Mathematical model","Optimization","Reservoirs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydrothermal power systems","particle swarm optimisation","power generation scheduling","pumped-storage power stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["APSO","two-unit hydro-thermal system","hydro-thermal scheduling period","hydrothermal scheduling problem","short-term pumped-storage hydro","accelerated particle swarm optimization","noncascaded short-term pumped-storage hydro-thermal scheduling","standard pumped-storage hydrothermal scheduling problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accelerated PSO","Hydro-thermal scheduling","Pumped-storage"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8566884","abstract":"This paper presents the implementation of a variant of the famous particle swarm optimization, known as Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO), on a non-cascaded or a two-unit hydro-thermal system with consideration of hydal pumping in light loading intervals of hydro-thermal scheduling period.

The degradation rates of not only the maximum power but also the other parameters such as short circuit current and open circuit voltage can be calculated from the expected I-V curves. In this paper, the outdoor degradation rates of poly crystalline Si and CIGS were calculated. As a result, in poly crystalline Si case, the degradation rate of maximum power was calculated as -0.4 %/year due to short circuit current reduction. In CIGS case, although the initial power generation performance was better than the datasheet value, the annual degradation rate of the maximum power was calculated as -2.1 %/year. The reason of maximum power reduction was the reduction of both short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculation of Degradation Rates of Poly Crystalline Si and CIGS PV Module using Outdoor Linear Interpolation Method","publicationTitle":"2018 7th International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications (ICRERA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRERA.2018.8566929","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 7th International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications (ICRERA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540960/8566698/08566929.pdf","startPage":"365","endPage":"370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRERA.2018.8566929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8566698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8566929","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Calculation of Degradation Rates of Poly Crystalline Si and CIGS PV Module using Outdoor Linear Interpolation Method","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8566929/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18324117","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation of Degradation Rates of Poly Crystalline Si and CIGS PV Module using Outdoor Linear Interpolation Method","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"108-Japan-Calculation-Izumi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077695S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540960","isNumber":"8566698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540960","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8566698","articleId":"8566929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8566948,"authors":[{"name":"Yaru Shan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University"],"firstName":"Yaru","lastName":"Shan","id":"37086547290"},{"name":"Fanggang Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University"],"firstName":"Fanggang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37535910000"},{"name":"Qiwei Zheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University"],"firstName":"Qiwei","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37086237940"},{"name":"Bo Ai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Ai","id":"37270328400"},{"name":"Zhangdui Zhong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University"],"firstName":"Zhangdui","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37287974400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5544-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5543-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5545-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8566948","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"abstract":"In high speed railway environment, the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system is especially susceptible to the carrier frequency offset (CFO).

First, we introduce the impulsive noise from the origin, classification and three mainstream detection algorithms aspects. Furthermore, four impulsive noise models are described including three memoryless models and a memory model. Then, we propose a detecting and suppressing scheme. The frequency offset is compensated in the designed beamforming network. The simulation results indicate that the impulsive noise is detrimental to the estimation of the Doppler frequency offset (DFO) and oscillator frequency offset (OFO). The effectiveness of the considered receivers in terms of the symbol error rate (SER) performs well in contrast to the other algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems Telecommunications (ITST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540572/8566703/08566948.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems Telecommunications (ITST)","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2018.8566948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2018.8566948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8566703","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8566948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impulsive Noise Mitigation in OFDM for High-speed Railway","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Hidden Markov models","Receivers","Probability density function","Estimation","Rail transportation","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","AWGN","error statistics","impulse noise","OFDM modulation","railway communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impulsive noise mitigation","high speed railway environment","conventional optimal receiver","additive white Gaussian noise","impulsive noise models","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM system","carrier frequency offset","mainstream detection algorithms","Doppler frequency offset","memoryless models","symbol error rate","oscillator frequency offset","beamforming network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-speed railway","OFDM","optimal receiver","frequency offset","impulsive noise."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8566948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Impulsive Noise Mitigation in OFDM for High-speed Railway","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8566948/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18323907","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impulsive Noise Mitigation in OFDM for High-speed Railway","confLoc":"Lisboa, Portugal","sourcePdf":"040ITST2018_paper_23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062152S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540572","isNumber":"8566703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540572","xplore-issue":"8566703","articleId":"8566948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567002,"authors":[{"name":"Harun Turker","affiliation":["Turker Ar-Ge Smart Grid Ltd Sti, Yozgat, Turkey"],"firstName":"Harun","lastName":"Turker","id":"37590886300"},{"name":"Ilhami Colak","affiliation":["inSmartGrid Bilisim Teknoloji Gelistirme, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ilhami","lastName":"Colak","id":"37389438300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5982-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5981-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5983-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2572-6013"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2377-6897"}],"articleNumber":"8567002","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":733},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Production","Batteries","Vehicle-to-grid","State of charge","Investment","Optimization","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicle charging","energy management systems","hybrid electric vehicles","linear programming","optimisation","photovoltaic power systems","vehicle-to-grid"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization","Smart Building","Vehicle-to-Grid concept","V2G","optimal Energy Management Strategy","Grid /PV /EV hybrid system","Grid-photovoltaic-electric Vehicle hybrid system","linear programming method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["energy management strategy","Grid/PV/EV hybrid system","linear programming","multiobjective optimization","optimal charging","selfconsumption","smart building","vehicle-to-grid."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567002","abstract":"This paper presents an optimal Energy Management Strategy (EMS) to optimize Grid /PV /EV hybrid system in Smart Building with a Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) concept and so bidirectional capability of the vehicle.

The PEMFC model includes 4 neural layer networks with 2 hidden neural layers. The proposed PEMFC model is constructed based on the operating data of PEMFC. The PEMFC ANN model considers five following variables which affect the degradation of PEMFC: stack current, stack temperature, air pressure, hydrogen pressure and air humidity. The results have shown that the PEMFC ANN model can successfully predict the degradation considering the mean relative error (RE) of degradation prediction is 0.0695%, and the degradation prediction performance of proposed model is better than that of the other model which only consider the PEMFC current and temperature. The RUL prediction can be given with an RE smaller than 5% after learning 400 h.","doi":"10.1109/ICRERA.2018.8567023","startPage":"407","endPage":"411","publicationTitle":"2018 7th International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications (ICRERA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRERA.2018.8567023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8566698","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 7th International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications (ICRERA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8540960/8566698/08567023.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Degradation and Remaining Useful Life Prediction based on Artificial Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567023/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Degradation and Remaining Useful Life Prediction based on Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8567023/","accessionNumber":"18324145","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Degradation and Remaining Useful Life Prediction based on Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"120-France-Proton-Exchange-Chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087227S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8540960","isNumber":"8566698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8540960","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8566698","articleId":"8567023","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8567024,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory N.

Essential differences are considered between conventional systems and mmWave communications, regarding directivity, sensitivity to blockage and high propagation loss. mmWave brings various challenges in communication on some issues such as anti-blocking, interference management, spatial reuse, dynamic control and system design for fully utilizing. In this study, we surveyed on solutions and standards for these challenges and we proposed design principles in architecture and protocols for mmWave communications. And previous studies in the literature on whether the millimeter wave band can be tested in small cell access in 5G, cellular access in 5G and wireless backhaul in 5G or not have been investigated. Also, we described prospective using areas of mmWave in 5G.","doi":"10.1109/ISMSIT.2018.8567053","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 2nd International Symposium on Multidisciplinary Studies and Innovative Technologies (ISMSIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543123/8566679/08567053.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8566679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMSIT.2018.8567053","publicationTitle":"2018 2nd International Symposium on Multidisciplinary Studies and Innovative Technologies (ISMSIT)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Review of Millimeter Wave Communication for 5G","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Review of Millimeter Wave Communication for 5G","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567053/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8567053/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18324443","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Review of Millimeter Wave Communication for 5G","confLoc":"Ankara, Turkey","sourcePdf":"PID5611543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095896S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543123","isNumber":"8566679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543123","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8566679","articleId":"8567053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8567057,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Sharabaty","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Electronic Eng, University of Turkish Aeronautical Association, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Sharabaty","id":"38053359200"},{"name":"Ihab Ahkam","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Electronic Eng, University of Turkish Aeronautical Association, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ihab","lastName":"Ahkam","id":"37086545741"},{"name":"Abdellatif Baba","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Electronic Eng, University of Turkish Aeronautical Association, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Abdellatif","lastName":"Baba","id":"37086545617"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4184-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4185-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567057","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Feature extraction","Heart","Databases","Diseases","Field programmable gate arrays","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","diseases","electrocardiography","feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","medical signal processing","neural nets","patient diagnosis","probability","random-access storage","signal classification","virtual instrumentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heart signal","portable multiheart diseases diagnosis system","FPGA-based multiheart diseases classification system","standard ECG features","ECG system","heart conditions","NVG-RAM classifiers","acquisition system","heart malfunctions","LabVIEW","electrocardiography","feature extraction","decision making","threshold decision","numeral virtual generalizing random-access memory","weightless neural network","Verilog HDL","Xilinx Spartan 3AN FPGA","FPGA mapping","probability of correct classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["heart diseases classification","threshold decision","NVG-RAM","FPGA","LabView","abnormal ECG diagnosis"]}],"abstract":"Electrocardiography (ECG) is one of the most important recording processes used in medicine; it provides a clear description of situation of the heart. The development of technological and computer science, which led to the emergence of high-resolution screens placed on the wrist and able to record the heart signal, increased the importance of developing a real time and portable multi heart diseases diagnosis system. In this paper, we propose an FPGA-based multi heart diseases classification system that identify eight different heart malfunctions depending on the standard ECG features. Our proposed ECG system, achieved with the aid of LabView, consists of three parts: Acquisition System, Feature Extraction and Making Decision using two different classifiers; Threshold Decision (TD) and Numeral Virtual Generalizing Random-Access Memory (NVG-RAM) weightless neural network. The proposed classifiers were implemented using Verilog HDL and Xilinx Spartan 3AN FPGA. The FPGA mapping showed that TD classifier occupy 1% of the hardware platform slices with execution time of 16 ns, while the NVG-RAM classifier utilize 21% of the FPGA slices with an increase of the execution time equal to 12.81 \u03bcs. On the other hand, the NVG-RAM outperforms the TD algorithm and the other proposed classifiers in the literature. In case of the experimental data, the probability of correct classification (PCC) of heart conditions was 100% for NVG-RAM and 98.84% for TD classifier. Whereas, the success rates in case of generated data for the executed TD and NVG-RAM classifiers were 98% and 100 %, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ISMSIT.2018.8567057","publicationTitle":"2018 2nd International Symposium on Multidisciplinary Studies and Innovative Technologies (ISMSIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 2nd International Symposium on Multidisciplinary Studies and Innovative Technologies (ISMSIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543123/8566679/08567057.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMSIT.2018.8567057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8566679","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Based Multi Heart Diseases Classification System with the Aid of LabVIEW","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Multi Heart Diseases Classification System with the Aid of LabVIEW","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567057/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18309123","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567057/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Multi Heart Diseases Classification System with the Aid of LabVIEW","confLoc":"Ankara, Turkey","sourcePdf":"PID5593753.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088417S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543123","isNumber":"8566679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543123","xplore-issue":"8566679","articleId":"8567057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567071,"authors":[{"name":"\u00dcmit \u015eent\u00fcrk","affiliation":["Computer Engineering, Duzce University, Duzce, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u00dcmit","lastName":"\u015eent\u00fcrk","id":"37086544434"},{"name":"Ibrahim Y\u00fcceda\u011f","affiliation":["Computer Engineering, Duzce University, Duzce, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Y\u00fcceda\u011f","id":"37085773171"},{"name":"Kemal Polat","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey"],"firstName":"Kemal","lastName":"Polat","id":"38193336800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4184-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4185-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567071","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1310},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blood pressure","Biomedical monitoring","Electrocardiography","Feature extraction","Standards","Estimation","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood pressure measurement","calibration","electrocardiography","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","patient monitoring","photoplethysmography","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid prediction model","PPG signals","repetitive neural network structure","ECG signals","RNN structure","short-term memory BLSTM","bidirectional LSTM layer","blood pressure value","LSTM layers","ReLU layer","estimated SBP","estimated DBP","measured DBP values","calibration free blood pressure measurement system","repetitive neural network based blood pressure estimation","bidirectational long-short term memory","time-domain attributes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blood pressure estimation","LSTM","RNN","Deep Neural Networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567071","abstract":"In this study, a new hybrid prediction model was proposed by combining ECG (Electrocardiography) and PPG (Photoplethysmographic) signals with a repetitive neural network (RNN) structure to estimate blood pressure continuously. The proposed method consists of two steps. In the first step, a total of 22 time-domain attributes were obtained from PPG and ECG signals to estimate systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values. In the second phase, these time-domain attributes are set as input to the RNN model and then the blood pressure is estimated. Within the RNN structure, there are two-way long short-term memory BLSTM (Bidirectational Long-Short Term Memory), LSTM and ReLU (Rectified-Linear unit) layers. The bidirectional LSTM layer has been used to remove the negative affects the blood pressure value of past and future effects of nonlinear physiological changes. The LSTM layers has ensured that learning is deep and that mistakes made are reduced. The ReLU layer has been allowed the neural network to quickly reach its conclusion. The same ECG and PPG signals obtained from the database have been cleared from noise and artifacts. And then ECG and PPG signals have been segmented according to peak values of these signals. The results have shown that RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) between the estimated SBP and the measured SBP with RNN model was 3.63 and the RMSE between the estimated DBP and the measured DBP values was 1.48 with RNN model. It has been seen that the used model has a more learning ability. Thanks to the proposed method, a calibration free blood pressure measurement system using PPG and ECG signals, was developed.","doi":"10.1109/ISMSIT.2018.8567071","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2018 2nd International Symposium on Multidisciplinary Studies and Innovative Technologies (ISMSIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMSIT.2018.8567071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8566679","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 2nd International Symposium on Multidisciplinary Studies and Innovative Technologies (ISMSIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543123/8566679/08567071.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Repetitive neural network (RNN) based blood pressure estimation using PPG and ECG signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567071/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Repetitive neural network (RNN) based blood pressure estimation using PPG and ECG signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8567071/","accessionNumber":"18309130","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repetitive neural network (RNN) based blood pressure estimation using PPG and ECG signals","confLoc":"Ankara, Turkey","sourcePdf":"PID5587431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051229S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543123","isNumber":"8566679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543123","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8566679","articleId":"8567071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8567173,"authors":[{"name":"Jinyuan He","affiliation":["Institute of Sustainable Industries & Livable Cities, Victoria University, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Jinyuan","lastName":"He","id":"37086563012"},{"name":"Le Sun","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086528069"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5059-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5060-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567173","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Resource management","Quality of service","Protocols","Computational modeling","Monitoring","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","contracts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud SLA applications","cloud services","SLA-related applications","cloud computing","service level agreements","cloud service providers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SLA","cloud computing","survey"]}],"abstract":"Service level agreements of cloud services are contracts between cloud service providers and cloud service users to regulate the provision and consumption of cloud services.

efficiently managing the network and reducing operating costs. In addition, with the recent improvements in distributed generation and storage systems, this has become even more important. Access to the high-resolution dataset derived from smart counters allows new forecasting strategies to evolve to match distributed load on the demand side. In this study, short-term load forecasting (STF) of a small region was performed using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) methods. For load forecasting, the electricity consumption and temperature data for the year 2017 were used as input to the network and next hour demand was predicted. The smallest forecasting error is investigated with the Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance criteria. It showed that RMSE is better than ANFIS with 616.2753 and MAPE 8.8688 prediction error.","doi":"10.1109/ISMSIT.2018.8567270","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2018 2nd International Symposium on Multidisciplinary Studies and Innovative Technologies (ISMSIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMSIT.2018.8567270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8566679","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 2nd International Symposium on Multidisciplinary Studies and Innovative Technologies (ISMSIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543123/8566679/08567270.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Networks and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems Approaches to Forecast the Electricity Data for Load Demand, an Analysis of Dinar District Case","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567270/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Networks and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems Approaches to Forecast the Electricity Data for Load Demand, an Analysis of Dinar District Case","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8567270/","accessionNumber":"18309162","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Networks and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems Approaches to Forecast the Electricity Data for Load Demand, an Analysis of Dinar District Case","confLoc":"Ankara, Turkey","sourcePdf":"PID5600389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067492S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543123","isNumber":"8566679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543123","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8566679","articleId":"8567270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":8567281,"authors":[{"name":"Fatih Ero\u011flu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey"],"firstName":"Fatih","lastName":"Ero\u011flu","id":"37086399096"},{"name":"Mehmet Kurto\u011flu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Kurto\u011flu","id":"37086398226"},{"name":"Ali Osman Arslan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ali Osman","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37085701986"},{"name":"Ahmet Mete Vural","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ahmet Mete","lastName":"Vural","id":"37271841700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4184-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4185-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567281","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of PS-PWM for Single-Phase Thirteen-Level Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel Inverters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567281","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Field programmable gate arrays","Pulse width modulation","Table lookup","Amplitude modulation","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridge circuits","cascade networks","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","PS-PWM","single-phase thirteen-level cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverters","single-phase thirteen-level CHB-MLI","gating signals","VHDL modules"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC-AC power converters","Pulse width modulation converters","Digital control"]}],"abstract":"An FPGA implementation of PS-PWM for a single-phase thirteen-level CHB-MLI is proposed in this paper.

The goal is to address the problems of companies that manage a large cloud infrastructure with thousands of nodes, and would like to optimize the scheduling of several requests submitted online by users. In our context, requests submitted by users are configured according to multi-objectives criteria, as the number of used CPUs and the used memory size, to take an example. The novelty of our strategies is to select effectively, from a large set of nodes forming the Cloud Computing platform, a node that execute the user request such that this node has a good compromise among a large set of multi-objectives criteria. In this paper, first we show the limit, in terms of performance, of exact solutions. Second, we introduce approximate algorithms in order to deal with high dimensional problems in terms of nodes number and criteria number. The proposed two scheduling strategies are based on exact Kung multi-objectives decision algorithm and k-means clustering algorithm or LSH hashing (random projection based) algorithm. The experiments of our new strategies demonstrate the potential of our approach under different scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/SC2.2018.00014","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 8th International Symposium on Cloud and Service Computing (SC2)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 8th International Symposium on Cloud and Service Computing (SC2)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566030/8567358/08567372.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"56","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC2.2018.00014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating the Computation of Multi-Objectives Scheduling Solutions for Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567372/","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating the Computation of Multi-Objectives Scheduling Solutions for Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov 2018","accessionNumber":"18343960","htmlLink":"/document/8567372/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating the Computation of Multi-Objectives Scheduling Solutions for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"023600a049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089152S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566030","isNumber":"8567358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566030","xplore-issue":"8567358","articleId":"8567372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567381,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Hsien Hsu","affiliation":["National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Hsien","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37086555501"},{"name":"Gunasekaran Manogaran","affiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Gunasekaran","lastName":"Manogaran","id":"37086555872"},{"name":"Parthasarathy Panchatcharam","affiliation":["VIT University, Vellore, India"],"firstName":"Parthasarathy","lastName":"Panchatcharam","id":"37086561106"},{"name":"S.

However, the special physical structure of FinFET also brings new defect models, which are hard to detect by conventional March algorithms, thus a more effective test methodology is required. In this paper, we investigate defect candidates in a FinFET 6T-SRAM circuit, analyze their fault behaviors, and propose a built-in self-test (BIST) scheme to enhance fault coverage and reduce test time. The proposed BIST approach is able to detect all target defects with only one read cycle, which reduces the required test algorithm complexity and hence reduces test time. This BIST scheme can be used with classical March algorithms, such as the March C-, to extend fault coverage beyond static single cell or coupling faults, thus reducing the defect level.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567404/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8567404/","accessionNumber":"18344046","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Built-in Self-Test Scheme for Detecting Defects in FinFET-Based SRAM Circuit","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Built-in Self-Test Scheme for Detecting Defects in FinFET-Based SRAM Circuit","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"946600a019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101214S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566099","isNumber":"8567389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566099","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8567389","articleId":"8567404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8567405,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Liu","affiliation":["School of Computers, Guangdong University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086563653"},{"name":"Jigang Wu","affiliation":["School of Computers, Guangdong University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jigang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086560813"},{"name":"Zhiqiang You","affiliation":["School of Computers, Guangdong University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"You","id":"37086561439"},{"name":"Michael Elimu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, China"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Elimu","id":"37086561261"},{"name":"Weizheng Wang","affiliation":["College of Computer and Communication Engineering, Changsha University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Weizheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086555063"},{"name":"Shuo Cai","affiliation":["College of Computer and Communication Engineering, Changsha University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Shuo","lastName":"Cai","id":"37086554581"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9466-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9467-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1081-7735"}],"articleNumber":"8567405","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567405","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Bridge circuits","Memristors","Resistance","Computer architecture","Transistors","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","memristors","nanoelectronics","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOL circuit","CMOL architecture","electrical defects","defect analysis","parallel March test algorithm","3d hybrid CMOS-memristor memory","resistive random access memory","sneak path problem","power consumption","large-scale memory system","memristor crossbars","CMOS molecular architecture","nonvolatile memories","RRAM","parallel March-like test algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non volatile memory, RRAM, CMOL, memristor, testing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ATS.2018.00016","endPage":"29","startPage":"25","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 27th Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 27th Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566099/8567389/08567405.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2018.00016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Defect Analysis and Parallel March Test Algorithm for 3D Hybrid CMOS-Memristor Memory","abstract":"As an attractive option of future non-volatile memories (NVM), resistive random access memory (RRAM) has attracted more attentions.

The unexpected and unclonable PUF information usually serves as a unique ID or secret key in various application scenarios. How to retrieve the PUF information securely at a reasonably low cost is then a concern. In this paper, we propose a new scheme to extract the PUF information by scan chain. PUF information is used to monitor the test control port (tc) of some specific scan cells at certain time. The output response under a designer-specific test vector is hence obfuscated. The difference between the obfuscated output and the normal output can be used to deduce the PUF information. By reusing the existing scan chain design, the design for PUF extraction cannot be removed easily and it incurs negligibly low overhead. As the specific test vector and related design detail are both unknown to others except designer, the probability for an attacker to figure out the PUF information is sufficiently low. This scheme to extract PUF information can be applied in metering technique or other security-sensitive scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2018.00030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2018.00030","endPage":"108","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 27th Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 27th Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566099/8567389/08567419.pdf","startPage":"104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Scheme to Extract PUF Information by Scan Chain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567419/","displayDocTitle":"A New Scheme to Extract PUF Information by Scan Chain","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18344035","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567419/","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Scheme to Extract PUF Information by Scan Chain","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"946600a104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114106S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566099","isNumber":"8567389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566099","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8567389","articleId":"8567419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567421,"authors":[{"name":"Qingli Guo","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Qingli","lastName":"Guo","id":"37086013511"},{"name":"Jing Ye","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Ye","id":"37394807500"},{"name":"Yue Gong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Gong","id":"37086011279"},{"name":"Yu Hu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085999473"},{"name":"Xiaowei Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Li","id":"37280862300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9466-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9467-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1081-7735"}],"articleNumber":"8567421","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":330},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Data models","Hardware","IP networks","Protocols","Predictive models","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pay-per-device scheme","IP protection","Convolutional Neural Network","CNN accelerator","IP vendor","obfuscated CNN model parameters","PUF responses","FPGA","physical unclonable function based pay-per-device scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CNN","IP Protection","pay-per-device","PUF"]}],"abstract":"With great success of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in many applications, it is not surprising that the CNN models will become commercial IPs. This paper proposes a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) based pay-per-device scheme for protecting IPs of CNN models. PUFs are embedded into the FPGA based CNN accelerator. The original CNN model trained by the IP vendor is obfuscated based on the PUFs before being distributed to the end users. The PUF challenges come from obfuscated CNN model parameters, and the PUF responses determine outputs of convolutional layers.

An effective and efficient quality management needs to be accurate to detect intolerable errors meanwhile light-weight in nature. However, it is difficult to design such a quality management satisfying both the two demands and existing work usually optimizes for one demand at the expense of the other. In this paper, we aim to achieve higher energy efficiency of quality management by optimizing detection accuracy and overhead simultaneously. We observe that the detection difficulty varies across inputs and there exists much redundant computation in detection process. Based on this observation, a cascaded quality management which can minimize the overhead and doesn't lower detection accuracy is proposed. The proposed solution pays more proper computation effort according to different detection difficulties of inputs so as to avoid unnecessary energy consumption. What's more, by exploring the design space sufficiently and effectively, we can assure the highest energy-efficiency of the proposed topology. The experiment results demonstrate that our approach can achieve much greater energy-efficiency than existing solutions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567424/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18344036","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"RiskCap: Minimizing Effort of Error Regulation for Approximate Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RiskCap: Minimizing Effort of Error Regulation for Approximate Computing","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"946600a133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078013S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566099","isNumber":"8567389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566099","xplore-issue":"8567389","articleId":"8567424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8567428,"authors":[{"name":"Shyue-Kung Lu","affiliation":["Dept.

However, it has the inevitable endurance problem of the storage cells. The limited endurance and other permanent faults cause serious reliability and yield challenges. Conventional techniques like hard repair schemes and error correction codes (ECC) are usually used to overcome these dilemmas. However, since soft errors are not a main threat for PCM, equipping ECC for each data word will waste a lot of memory space for storing the check bits. Therefore, progressive ECC techniques are proposed to solve this drawback in this paper. The main idea is to equip ECC for data words when their first faulty bits are detected. That is, only the fault detection code is equipped for data words such that the original code rate is high. A separated ECC DRAM is used for storing the check bits. Two types of progressive ECC techniques\u00bethe local progressive ECC (LPE) technique and the global progressive ECC (GPE) technique are presented. The proposed techniques are also easy to be integrated with the conventional BISR (Built-in Self-repair) architectures. According to experimental results, the degradation of repair rate and reliability are almost negligible. However, the hardware overhead is at least 70% lower than the original ECC technique.","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2018.00039","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 27th Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 27th Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566099/8567389/08567428.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2018.00039","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progressive ECC Techniques for Phase Change Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Progressive ECC Techniques for Phase Change Memory","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18344032","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567428/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressive ECC Techniques for Phase Change Memory","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"946600a161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071909S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566099","isNumber":"8567389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566099","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8567389","articleId":"8567428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567429,"authors":[{"name":"Mamoru Ishizaka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Mamoru","lastName":"Ishizaka","id":"37086559828"},{"name":"Michihiro Shintani","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Michihiro","lastName":"Shintani","id":"37086557090"},{"name":"Michiko Inoue","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Michiko","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37085417823"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9466-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9467-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1081-7735"}],"articleNumber":"8567429","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area-Efficient and Reliable Hybrid CMOS/Memristor ECC Circuit for ReRAM Storage","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 27th Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566099/8567389/08567429.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"172","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 27th Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2018.00040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567389","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2018.00040","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","DRAM chips","error correction codes","low-power electronics","memristors","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resistive random access memory","high-storage-density","low power consumption","ReRAM-based memory","static random access memory","error correction code circuit","reliable ReRAM storage","conventional CMOS technology","reliable hybrid CMOS-memristor ECC circuit","nonvolatile memory material","write endurance","frequent write operations","dynamic random access memory","DRAM","SRAM","storage capacity 1024.0 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resistive Random Access Memory","Memristor","Crossbar array","Error check and correction code","Reliability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567429","abstract":"Resistive random access memory (ReRAM) has several attractive features such as high-storage-density and high-switching with low power consumption. It is hence regarded as the most promising nonvolatile memory material. However, a memristor, which is a primitive component of the ReRAM-based memory, has much lower write endurance than that of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) or static random access memory (SRAM). Hence, error correction code (ECC) circuit is indispensable for realizing reliable ReRAM storage. For this purpose, in this paper, we propose a hybrid CMOS/memristor-based ECC circuit. In the proposed circuit, the blocks with highly frequent write operations are implemented by the conventional CMOS technology and the others are implemented by the memristors to keep a balance between the area overhead and reliablity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed ECC circuits have less area and high reliability compared to ECC circuits that are fully implemented by memristors, and achieves less area while preserving the reliability compare to ECC circuits that are fully implemented by CMOS technology, where an area reduction of 19.9% is achieved for data words with 1,024 bits and the area reduction is improved as the data bit length increases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18344058","htmlLink":"/document/8567429/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Area-Efficient and Reliable Hybrid CMOS/Memristor ECC Circuit for ReRAM Storage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area-Efficient and Reliable Hybrid CMOS/Memristor ECC Circuit for ReRAM Storage","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"946600a167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067459S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566099","isNumber":"8567389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566099","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8567389","articleId":"8567429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567430,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Chu Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Chu","lastName":"Huang","id":"38183099400"},{"name":"Jeffae Schroff","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics & Statistics, University of Houston-Downtown, Texas, US"],"firstName":"Jeffae","lastName":"Schroff","id":"37086558082"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9466-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9467-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1081-7735"}],"articleNumber":"8567430","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567430","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Artificial neural networks","Built-in self-test","Transient analysis","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","error detection","integrated circuit testing","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2LN march tests","self-healing ability","analog-Berger-code error detection","neuromorphic RRAM","AI applications","precompensation technique","linear-system-based BIST architecture","uncompensated degradation","permanent defects","variation learning","asymmetric errors","MNIST handwritten digit dataset","neural network","transient error detection","resistive degradation compensation","L-level RRAM","diagonal sliding march test"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Associate Memory","RRAM","Neural Network","Variation Learning","Berger Codes","Linear System","BIST","Computation in Memory"]}],"abstract":"Neuromorphic RRAM has become the most promising candidate for AI applications.

Moreover this testing method also facilitates the testing of a biochip with other bioassay operations running concurrently.","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2018.00043","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 27th Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 27th Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566099/8567389/08567432.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2018.00043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test Diagnosis of Digital Microfluidic Biochips Using Image Segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567432/","displayDocTitle":"Test Diagnosis of Digital Microfluidic Biochips Using Image Segmentation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18344063","htmlLink":"/document/8567432/","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test Diagnosis of Digital Microfluidic Biochips Using Image Segmentation","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"946600a185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085316S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566099","isNumber":"8567389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566099","xplore-issue":"8567389","articleId":"8567432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567436,"authors":[{"name":"Guan-Hao Hou","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering"],"firstName":"Guan-Hao","lastName":"Hou","id":"37086555386"},{"name":"Wei-Chen Huang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering"],"firstName":"Wei-Chen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086558716"},{"name":"Jiun-Lang Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jiun-Lang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085461363"},{"name":"Terry Kuo","affiliation":["OpenATE Inc., Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Terry","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37078291100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9466-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9467-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1081-7735"}],"articleNumber":"8567436","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Delays","Clocks","Delay lines","Generators","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","test equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA","pre-processed control signals","EG pool structure","FPGA resource usage","controller timing complexity","16-channel formatter","FPGA-based digital IC testers","FPGA-based test equipment","formatter architecture","formatter channels","FPGA-based 16-channel data-timing formatter","time-format set table","symbol generation","compact time-format set tables","delay codes","edge generator pool structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["automatic test equipment","FPGA","data/timing formatter"]}],"abstract":"FPGA-based digital IC testers have been commercialized and shown to be a promising solution for low to mid-end applications. For FPGA-based test equipment to be a practical solution, it is crucial to increase the number of channels that one single FPGA can accommodate. The objective of this work is to develop a data/timing formatter architecture that consumes less FPGA resources so as to accommodate 16 formatter channels in one Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA. To reach this goal, the proposed formatter utilizes the more compact time/format set tables to store the pre-processed control signals and delay codes required for symbol generation. To match the time/format set table based symbol generation, a new EG (edge generator) pool structure is developed; it also lowers FPGA resource usage without sacrificing the timing accuracy. Furthermore, the EG is redesigned to reduce the controller timing complexity. The proposed 16-channel formatter has been implemented on a Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA. Compared to the previously reported 5-channel formatter, it delivers the same performance (200 ps edge placement resolution and 100 MSPS symbol rate) without significant increase in FPGA resource usage.","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2018.00047","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 27th Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 27th Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566099/8567389/08567436.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2018.00047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567389","startPage":"209","endPage":"214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of an FPGA-Based 16-Channel Data/Timing Formatter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of an FPGA-Based 16-Channel Data/Timing Formatter","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567436/","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18344045","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567436/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of an FPGA-Based 16-Channel Data/Timing Formatter","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"946600a209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062184S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566099","isNumber":"8567389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566099","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8567389","articleId":"8567436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567475,"authors":[{"name":"Teppei Matsubara","affiliation":["Dept.

An automated diagnosis method to aid pathologists that is magnification independent will significantly save time, reduce cost and mitigate subjectivity and errors in current histopathological diagnosis procedures. This paper presents a deep learning network, called MVPNet and a customized data augmentation technique, called NuView, for magnification independent diagnosis. MVPNet is tailored to tackle the most common issues (diversity, relatively small size of datasets and manifestation of diagnostic biomarkers at various magnification levels) with breast cancer histology data to perform the classification. The network simultaneously analyzes local and global features of a given tissue image. It does so by viewing the tissue at varying levels of relative nuclei sizes. MVPNet has significantly less parameters than standard transfer learning deep models with comparable performance and it combines and processes local and global features simulatenously for effective diagnosis. Additionally, NuView extracts tumor nuclei location and points the attention of MVPNet to the informative region specifically. The method gives an average magnification independent classification accuracy of 92.2% as compared to 83% reported in literature on the BreaKHis database.","doi":"10.1109/BIBE.2018.00044","startPage":"189","endPage":"194","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 18th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBE.2018.00044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567439","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 18th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566098/8567439/08567483.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"[Regular Paper] MVPNets: Multi-viewing Path Deep Learning Neural Networks for Magnification Invariant Diagnosis in Breast Cancer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567483/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"[Regular Paper] MVPNets: Multi-viewing Path Deep Learning Neural Networks for Magnification Invariant Diagnosis in Breast Cancer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8567483/","accessionNumber":"18381605","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"[Regular Paper] MVPNets: Multi-viewing Path Deep Learning Neural Networks for Magnification Invariant Diagnosis in Breast Cancer","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"247100a189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097941S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566098","isNumber":"8567439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566098","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8567439","articleId":"8567483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8567489,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Lyu","affiliation":["Faculty of information technology and equipment engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Lyu","id":"37086109539"},{"name":"LiKang Xu","affiliation":["School of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"LiKang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086559757"},{"name":"Ningmei Yu","affiliation":["School of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Ningmei","lastName":"Yu","id":"37588111700"},{"name":"Hejiu Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hejiu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086112754"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6217-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5043-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2471-7819"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2159-5410"}],"articleNumber":"8567489","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","Biomedical imaging","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Image resolution","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological techniques","biomedical transducers","CMOS image sensors","image reconstruction","image resolution","medical image processing","microfluidics","microsensors","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear CMOS image sensor","SOC integrated local contrast stretch","multifrequency counter","off-chip global contrast stretching algorithm","nonlinear single-slope ADC","image quality degradation","cell imaging","biomicrofluidic imaging","super-resolution reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["point-of-Care (POC) diagnosis","CMOS image sensor","Contrast stretch","Bio-microfluidic imaging"]}],"abstract":"A nonlinear single-slope ADC with SOC integrated local contrast stretch using a configurable multi-frequency counter for bio-microfluidic imaging is presented in this paper.

This promising paradigm thus can find its wide applications in various industrial scenarios and smart cities in which the resource requirements will be divided into peak-hour or non-peak-hour. To deal with such features of applications, a flexible resource allocation approach based on pricing model can be critical for the success of such paradigm. To the best of our knowledge, we have not seen such pricing based resource allocation approach ever been reported for FC scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel pricing based dynamic resource allocation model through overbooking mechanism, and it is realized through three steps: 1) According to different QoS requirements of user tasks, methods of on-demand billing, daily billing, and auction billing are designed, in which we allow the resource to be overbooked; 2) For auction billing, we design an auction approach including pricing rule and winner determination rule. We prove that our auction approach guarantees individual rationality, computational efficiency, and truthfulness. 3) To overbook as much resource as possible with a high degree of QoS satisfaction of on-demand and daily billing, we overbook the resource based on a resource utilization prediction using neural network and service level agreement violation feedback. In the end, we validate the mechanism with real-world data trace. Experimental results show that our auction approach achieves desirable properties, and our dynamic resource overbooking mechanism maximizes the profit of nodes with a high degree of QoS satisfaction of on-demand and daily billing and a high resource utilization prediction accuracy rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 15th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems

In this data enriched infrastructure, privacy-preserving data aggregation (PPDA) is one of the most critical services. However, the security and privacy-preserving requirements and online computational cost still present practical concerns in edge computing for resource-constraint edge terminals. To cope with this challenge, we present a lightweight privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme named LPDA-EC for edge computing system by employing the online/offline signature technique, Paillier homomorphic cryptosystem, and double trapdoor Chameleon hash function in this paper. The proposed LPDA-EC scheme can achieve data confidentiality and privacy-preserving, ensuring that the edge server and control center are agnostic of the user's private information during the whole aggregation process. Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate that our scheme is existentially unforgeable under chosen message attack (EU-CMA) and ensures data integrity with formal proofs under q-Strong Diffie-Hellman (q-SDH) assumptions. Numerical results indicate that the LPDA-EC scheme has less computational and communication overheads.","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2018.00024","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 15th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 15th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566100/8567522/08567546.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2018.00024","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LPDA-EC: A Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation Scheme for Edge Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"LPDA-EC: A Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation Scheme for Edge Computing","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18324815","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567546/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LPDA-EC: A Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation Scheme for Edge Computing","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"558000a098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109484S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566100","isNumber":"8567522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566100","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8567522","articleId":"8567546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567555,"authors":[{"name":"Beom-Su Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Beom-Su","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086042365"},{"name":"Ki-Il Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Ki-Il","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280254900"},{"name":"BongSoo Roh","affiliation":["The 2nd R&D Institute, Agency for Defense Development, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"BongSoo","lastName":"Roh","id":"38244516500"},{"name":"HyungSeok Choi","affiliation":["The 2nd R&D Institute, Agency for Defense Development, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"HyungSeok","lastName":"Choi","id":"37086383525"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5580-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5581-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2155-6806"}],"articleNumber":"8567555","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Routing protocols","Cognitive radio","Ad hoc networks","Prediction algorithms","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","mobile radio","radio spectrum management","routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum aware routing protocol","cognitive radio ad hoc networks","mobility speed","end-to-end delay","prediction algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum Aware Routing, Channel Availability"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a new spectrum aware routing protocol that is based on the number of available channels obtained by prediction algorithm and number of hops to reduce the end-to-end delay in cognitive radio ad hoc networks.

Blockchain technologies enable semi-anonymous multi-party interactions and can be utilized in crowdsensing applications to maintain the privacy of the mobile users while ensuring first-rate crowdsensed data. In this work, we propose to use blockchain technologies and smart contracts to orchestrate the interactions between mobile crowdsensing providers and mobile users for the case of spatial crowdsensing, where mobile users need to be at specific locations to perform the tasks. Smart contracts, by operating as processes that are executed on the blockchain, are used to preserve users' privacy and make payments. Furthermore, for the assignment of the crowdsensing tasks to the mobile users, we design a truthful, cost-optimal auction that minimizes the payments from the crowdsensing providers to the mobile users. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed privacy preserving auction outperforms state-of-the-art proposals regarding cost by ten times for high numbers of mobile users and tasks.","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2018.00068","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 15th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 15th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566100/8567522/08567590.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2018.00068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy Preserving and Cost Optimal Mobile Crowdsensing Using Smart Contracts on Blockchain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Privacy Preserving and Cost Optimal Mobile Crowdsensing Using Smart Contracts on Blockchain","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567590/","accessionNumber":"18309604","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy Preserving and Cost Optimal Mobile Crowdsensing Using Smart Contracts on Blockchain","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"558000a442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072453S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566100","isNumber":"8567522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566100","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8567522","articleId":"8567590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8567613,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Qiang","affiliation":["Space Engineering University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Qiang","id":"37086545992"},{"name":"Zhu Wei-gang","affiliation":["Space Engineering University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Wei-gang","id":"38270421200"},{"name":"Bo Yuan","affiliation":["Space Engineering University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37086545384"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7946-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7945-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7947-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567613","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"abstract":"Aiming at the poor effect of traditional electronic warfare (EW) jamming style selection on modern multifunctional radar, a jamming style selection model based on jamming rule base and the support vector machine (SVM) jamming style selection method suitable for the model is proposed to improve the jamming style selection correct rate and reduce the jamming style selection time.

Digital cancellation method is an important step to remove the residue self-interference signal in digital domain. In this paper, a self- interference cancellation scheme based on deep learning for full-duplex systems is proposed. We investigate the joint effects of non-linear distortion and linear multi-path channel on the performance of digital cancellation and model those factors by deep neural network which could process arbitrary sequences of inputs with temporal coherence and perfectly handle non-linear problem. The real-time experimental results show that our method has desirable performance than previous research. Its performance has better gain compared with traditional methods since it can solve both linear and non-linear problem.

To provide VR from untethered mobile devices, a viable solution is to remotely render VR frames from the edge cloud, but encounters challenges from the limited computation and communication capacities of the edge cloud when serving multiple mobile VR users at the same time. In this paper, we envision the key reason of such challenges as the ignorance of redundancy across VR frames being rendered, and aim to fundamentally remove this performance constraint on highly dynamic VR applications by adaptively reusing the redundant VR frames being rendered for different VR users. Such redundancy in each frame is decided at run-time by the edge cloud, which is then able to memoize the previous results of VR frame rendering for future reuse by other users. After a VR frame is generated, the edge cloud further reuses its redundant pixels compared with other frames, and only transmits the distinct portion of this frame to mobile devices. We have implemented our design over Android OS and Unity VR application engine, and demonstrated that our design can efficiently reduce the computation burden at the edge cloud by more than 90%, and reduce more than 95% of the VR frame data being transmitted to mobile devices.","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2018.00008","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566118/8567645/08567653.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2018.00008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567645","startPage":"1","endPage":"16","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MUVR: Supporting Multi-User Mobile Virtual Reality with Resource Constrained Edge Cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567653","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MUVR: Supporting Multi-User Mobile Virtual Reality with Resource Constrained Edge Cloud","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567653/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18344092","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567653/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MUVR: Supporting Multi-User Mobile Virtual Reality with Resource Constrained Edge Cloud","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"944500a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101843S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566118","isNumber":"8567645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566118","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8567645","articleId":"8567653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567655,"authors":[{"name":"Yifan Wang","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086561455"},{"name":"Shaoshan Liu","affiliation":["PerceptIn, California, USA"],"firstName":"Shaoshan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086048963"},{"name":"Xiaopei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaopei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086426794"},{"name":"Weisong Shi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Weisong","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085536387"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9445-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9446-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567655","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":670},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567655","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Autonomous vehicles","Computer architecture","Task analysis","Edge computing","Hardware","Simultaneous localization and mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","control engineering computing","distributed processing","mobile robots","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["connected and autonomous vehicles","edge computing platform","architecture design","cache architecture","cache miss observation","CAVs computing system","comprehensive application benchmark","edge computing system","CAVBench"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, Computing Architecture, Benchmark Suite"]}],"abstract":"Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have recently attracted a significant amount of attention both from researchers and industry. Numerous studies targeting algorithms, software frameworks, and applications on the CAVs scenario have emerged. Meanwhile, several pioneer efforts have focused on the edge computing system and architecture design for the CAVs scenario and provided various heterogeneous platform prototypes for CAVs. However, a standard and comprehensive application benchmark for CAVs is missing, hindering the study of these emerging computing systems. To address this challenging problem, we present CAVBench, the first benchmark suite for the edge computing system in the CAVs scenario. CAVBench is comprised of six typical applications covering four dominate CAVs scenarios and takes four datasets as standard input. CAVBench provides quantitative evaluation results via application and system perspective output metrics. We perform a series of experiments and acquire three systemic characteristics of the applications in CAVBench. First, the operation intensity of the applications is polarized, which explains why heterogeneous hardware is important for a CAVs computing system. Second, all applications in CAVBench consume high memory bandwidth, so the system should be equipped with high bandwidth memory or leverage good memory bandwidth management to avoid the performance degradation caused by memory bandwidth competition. Third, some applications have worse data/instruction locality based on the cache miss observation, so the computing system targeting these applications should optimize the cache architecture. Last, we use the CAVBench to evaluate a typical edge computing platform and present the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the benchmarking results.","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2018.00010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2018.00010","startPage":"30","endPage":"42","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566118/8567645/08567655.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CAVBench: A Benchmark Suite for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567655/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"CAVBench: A Benchmark Suite for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18344107","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567655/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAVBench: A Benchmark Suite for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"944500a030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.144245S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566118","isNumber":"8567645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566118","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8567645","articleId":"8567655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8567658,"authors":[{"name":"Rahmadi Trimananda","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine"],"firstName":"Rahmadi","lastName":"Trimananda","id":"37706985800"},{"name":"Ali Younis","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Younis","id":"37086554963"},{"name":"Bojun Wang","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine"],"firstName":"Bojun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086561807"},{"name":"Bin Xu","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086562285"},{"name":"Brian Demsky","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Demsky","id":"37329631300"},{"name":"Guoqing Xu","affiliation":["University of California, Los Angeles"],"firstName":"Guoqing","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086554931"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9445-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9446-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567658","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":586},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567658","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart homes","ZigBee","Security","Device drivers","Programming","Switches","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","data privacy","home computing","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Vigilia","securing smart home edge computing","smart home IoT devices","modern programmable smart home hubs","device-based network permissions","home security","IoT-defense systems","vulnerabilities","home privacy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["smart home, security, privacy, programming model"]}],"abstract":"Smart home IoT devices are becoming increasingly popular.

As existing smart home systems are closed, we have created an open implementation of a similar programming and configuration model in Vigilia and extended the execution environment to maximally restrict communications by instantiating device-based network permissions.

However the training can hardly be carried out on mobile devices because the training of these models requires much computational power. An individual user with the demand of deriving DNN models from her own datasets usually has to outsource the training procedure onto an edge server. However this outsourcing method violates privacy because it exposes the users' data to curious service providers. In this paper, we utilize the differentially private mechanism to enable the privacy-preserving edge based training of DNN face recognition models. During the training, DNN is split between the user device and the edge server in a way that both private data and model parameters are protected, with only a small cost of local computations. We rigorously prove that our approach is privacy preserving. We finally show that our mechanism is capable of training models in different scenarios, e.g., from scratch, or through fine-tuning over existed models.","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2018.00014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2018.00014","endPage":"102","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566118/8567645/08567659.pdf","startPage":"90","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning from Differentially Private Neural Activations with Edge Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567659/","displayDocTitle":"Learning from Differentially Private Neural Activations with Edge Computing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18344084","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567659/","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning from Differentially Private Neural Activations with Edge Computing","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"944500a090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09716S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566118","isNumber":"8567645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566118","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8567645","articleId":"8567659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567660,"authors":[{"name":"Rufaida Ahmed","affiliation":["University of Utah"],"firstName":"Rufaida","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37086563749"},{"name":"Zirak Zaheer","affiliation":["University of Utah"],"firstName":"Zirak","lastName":"Zaheer","id":"37086555763"},{"name":"Richard Li","affiliation":["University of Utah"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Li","id":"37086561071"},{"name":"Robert Ricci","affiliation":["University of Utah"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Ricci","id":"37295811900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9445-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9446-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567660","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Web services","Computer crime","Cryptography","Edge computing","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","computer network security","Java","multiprocessing systems","Web services","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security threats","secret materials","CDN","Harpocrates","active code","origin webserver","denial-of-service attacks","specific website","web services","active computation","Intel SGX technology","static content","content distribution networks","server-less computing","customer code","JavaScript WebWorker API"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge computing, content distribution networks, Intel SGX"]}],"abstract":"Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) offer websites and web services the ability to host content on servers that are near the edge of the network, close to users. Benefits of this arrangement include low latency, scalability, and resistance to Denial of Service attacks. Traditionally, CDNs have hosted primarily static content, but increasingly, there is an interest in pushing active computation to the edge as well. This active computation, which is similar in style to the \"server-less\" computing becoming popular in clouds, offers a wealth of new opportunities for web services to be-come faster and more scalable. With this opportunity, however, comes a much greater exposure to security threats. One is leakage of secret materials (such as keys, identities, etc.) that are accessed by these functions. Another is the possibility that sensitive calculations are not executed faithfully in the CDN; e.g. a modified version of the customer's code is run. In this paper, we present the design of Harpocrates, a framework that allows active code to be pushed from an origin webserver out to workers at the edge of a CDN. Harpocrates makes use of Intel's SGX technology to keep data private, and presents an environment similar to the JavaScript WebWorker API to simplify the process of code that can run on either origin servers or the CDN. We use Harpocrates to design a number of interesting services, including a service that generates and checks secure cookies within the CDN, and a framework that protects against denial-of-service attacks in a way that is customized to a specific website. We show that the framework performs well enough to be deployable in practice.","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2018.00015","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566118/8567645/08567660.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2018.00015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harpocrates: Giving Out Your Secrets and Keeping Them Too","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567660/","displayDocTitle":"Harpocrates: Giving Out Your Secrets and Keeping Them Too","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18344086","htmlLink":"/document/8567660/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harpocrates: Giving Out Your Secrets and Keeping Them Too","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"944500a103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067279S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566118","isNumber":"8567645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566118","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8567645","articleId":"8567660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8567661,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Chun Hung","affiliation":["University of Southern California"],"firstName":"Chien-Chun","lastName":"Hung","id":"37086559522"},{"name":"Ganesh Ananthanarayanan","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Ganesh","lastName":"Ananthanarayanan","id":"37829075300"},{"name":"Peter Bodik","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Bodik","id":"37086176329"},{"name":"Leana Golubchik","affiliation":["University of Southern California"],"firstName":"Leana","lastName":"Golubchik","id":"37276320900"},{"name":"Minlan Yu","affiliation":["Harvard University"],"firstName":"Minlan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086553680"},{"name":"Paramvir Bahl","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Paramvir","lastName":"Bahl","id":"37270007700"},{"name":"Matthai Philipose","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Matthai","lastName":"Philipose","id":"37283663700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9445-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9446-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567661","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1530},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567661","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Merging","Cloud computing","Streaming media","Organizations","Detectors","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["query processing","video retrieval","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VideoEdge","live video","video analytics queries","search space","video query planning","camera streams","Pareto band"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["video analytics","scheduling","distributed clusters"]}],"abstract":"Organizations deploy a hierarchy of clusters - cameras, private clusters, public clouds - for analyzing live video feeds from their cameras. Video analytics queries have many implementation options which impact their resource demands and accuracy of outputs. Our objective is to select the \"query plan\" - implementations (and their knobs) - and place it across the hierarchy of clusters, and merge common components across queries to maximize the average query accuracy. This is a challenging task, because we have to consider multi-resource (network and compute) demands and constraints in the hierarchical cluster and search in an exponentially large search space for plans, placements, and merging. We propose VideoEdge, a system that introduces dominant demand to identify the best tradeoff between multiple resources and accuracy, and narrows the search space by identifying a \"Pareto band\" of promising configurations. VideoEdge also balances the resource benefits and accuracy penalty of merging queries. Deployment results show that VideoEdge improves accuracy by 25:4 and 5:4 compared to fair allocation of resources and a recent solution for video query planning (VideoStorm), respectively, and is within 6% of optimum.","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2018.00016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2018.00016","startPage":"115","endPage":"131","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566118/8567645/08567661.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VideoEdge: Processing Camera Streams using Hierarchical Clusters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567661/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"VideoEdge: Processing Camera Streams using Hierarchical Clusters","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18344110","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567661/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VideoEdge: Processing Camera Streams using Hierarchical Clusters","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"944500a115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134259S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566118","isNumber":"8567645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566118","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8567645","articleId":"8567661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8567662,"authors":[{"name":"Si Young Jang","affiliation":["School of Computing, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Si Young","lastName":"Jang","id":"37085805706"},{"name":"Yoonhyung Lee","affiliation":["School of Computing, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yoonhyung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086560671"},{"name":"Byoungheon Shin","affiliation":["School of Computing, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byoungheon","lastName":"Shin","id":"38237302900"},{"name":"Dongman Lee","affiliation":["School of Computing, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongman","lastName":"Lee","id":"38335424800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9445-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9446-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567662","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":921},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567662","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Streaming media","Containers","Computer architecture","Quality of service","Cloud computing","Ontologies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","Internet of Things","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","quality of service","video signal processing","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application-aware IoT camera virtualization","video analytics edge computing","image processing","edge IoT camera virtualization architecture","physical camera","IoT camera reconfiguration scheme","ontology-based application description","container technology","QoS application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IoT","edge computing","video analytics","virtualization"]}],"abstract":"Video analytics edge computing exploiting IoT cameras has gained high attention. Running such tasks on the network edge is very challenging since video and image processing are both bandwidth-hungry and computationally intensive. Unlike traditional computing systems, IoT cameras are heavily dependent on the environmental factors such as brightness of the view. In this paper, we propose an edge IoT camera virtualization architecture. For this, we leverage an ontology-based application description model and virtualize the IoT camera with container technology that decouples the physical camera and support multiple applications on board. We also develop an IoT camera reconfiguration scheme that allows IoT cameras to dynamically adjust their configuration to environmental context changes without degrading application QoS. Experimental results based on our prototype implementation show that the responsiveness of our system is 2.8x faster than existing approaches in reconfiguring to the environmental context changes.","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2018.00017","startPage":"132","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566118/8567645/08567662.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2018.00017","endPage":"144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application-Aware IoT Camera Virtualization for Video Analytics Edge Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Application-Aware IoT Camera Virtualization for Video Analytics Edge Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8567662/","accessionNumber":"18344069","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application-Aware IoT Camera Virtualization for Video Analytics Edge Computing","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"944500a132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092588S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566118","isNumber":"8567645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566118","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8567645","articleId":"8567662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567664,"authors":[{"name":"Junjue Wang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Junjue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086557590"},{"name":"Ziqiang Feng","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Ziqiang","lastName":"Feng","id":"37086556635"},{"name":"Zhuo Chen","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Zhuo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085441762"},{"name":"Shilpa George","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Shilpa","lastName":"George","id":"37086563471"},{"name":"Mihir Bala","affiliation":["University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Mihir","lastName":"Bala","id":"37086553838"},{"name":"Padmanabhan Pillai","affiliation":["Intel Labs"],"firstName":"Padmanabhan","lastName":"Pillai","id":"37282734900"},{"name":"Shao-Wen Yang","affiliation":["Intel Labs"],"firstName":"Shao-Wen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086562798"},{"name":"Mahadev Satyanarayanan","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Mahadev","lastName":"Satyanarayanan","id":"37284772500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9445-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9446-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567664","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1795},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567664","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Drones","Streaming media","Bandwidth","Wireless communication","Long Term Evolution","Object detection","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","distributed processing","remotely operated vehicles","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge computing","wireless bandwidth","adaptive computer vision pipeline","energy consumption","autonomous drones","real-time video analytics","bandwidth-efficient live video analytics","drone-based processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge Computing","Cloudlet","Drone","Vision Pipeline","Bandwidth efficient"]}],"abstract":"Real-time video analytics on small autonomous drones poses several difficult challenges at the intersection of wireless bandwidth, processing capacity, energy consumption, result accuracy, and timeliness of results.

While previous works have investigated the general concept of cloudlets, little attention has been directed to the question of where to actually place cloudlets on existing infrastructure in a city. Due to cloudlets' heterogeneity in this context, their placement remains challenging. In this paper, we first provide a thorough analysis of a city-wide cloudlet infrastructure deployed on three types of existing infrastructures that act as wireless access points: cellular base stations, commercial off-the-shelf routers, and smart lamp posts. Based on real-world data for the access point locations in a major city and movement traces of two mobile applications, we analyze multiple coverage metrics to gain insights on the practicability of leveraging these infrastructures for a city-scale deployment of cloudlets. As a second major contribution, we propose a novel placement strategy that takes into account the heterogeneity in terms of communication ranges, resources, and costs associated with each type of cloudlet. Our strategy enables the tradeoff between deployment cost and quality of service as required for different deployment scenarios. The effectiveness of our strategy is confirmed through real-world-trace-based evaluation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Urban areas","Edge computing","Base

closed-loop applications that reside at the edge. These applications often involve a large number of sensors that generate volumes of data, which must be processed and disseminated in real-time to potentially a large number of entities for actuation, thereby forming a closed-loop, publish-process-subscribe system. To meet the response time requirements of such applications, this paper presents techniques to realize a scalable, fog/edge-based broker architecture that balances data publication and processing loads for topic-based, publish-process-subscribe systems operating at the edge, and assures the Quality-of-Service (QoS), specified as the 90th percentile latency, on a per-topic basis. The key contributions include: (a) a sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of features such as publishing rate, number of subscribers, per-sample processing interval and background load on a topic's performance; (b) a latency prediction model for a set of co-located topics, which is then used for the latency-aware placement of topics on brokers; and (c) an optimization problem formulation for k-topic co-location to minimize the number of brokers while meeting each topic's QoS requirement. Here, k denotes the maximum number of topics that can be placed on a broker. We show that the problem is NP-hard for k >=3 and present three load balancing heuristics. Empirical results are presented to validate the latency prediction model and to evaluate the performance of the proposed heuristics.","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2018.00023","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566118/8567645/08567668.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2018.00023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Edge Computing for Low Latency Data Dissemination in Topic-Based Publish/Subscribe","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567668/","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Edge Computing for Low Latency Data Dissemination in Topic-Based Publish/Subscribe","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8567668/","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18344105","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Edge Computing for Low Latency Data Dissemination in Topic-Based Publish/Subscribe","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"944500a214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.138846S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566118","isNumber":"8567645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566118","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8567645","articleId":"8567668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567670,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086032734"},{"name":"Yue Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085779015"},{"name":"Chao Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37086555438"},{"name":"Yang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086295205"},{"name":"X.

Task allocation in such an environment faces several unique challenges: (i) the objectives of applications and edge devices may be inconsistent or even conflicting with each other, and (ii) edge devices may only be partially collaborative in finishing the computation tasks due to the \"rational actor\" nature and trust constraints of these devices, and (iii) an edge device's availability to participate in computation can change over time and the application is often unaware of such availability dynamics. Many social sensing applications are also delay-sensitive, which further exacerbates the problem. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel game-theoretic task allocation framework. The framework includes a dynamic feedback incentive mechanism, a decentralized fictitious play with a new negotiation scheme, and a judiciously-designed private payoff function. The proposed framework was implemented on a testbed that consists of heterogeneous edge devices (Jetson TX1, TK1, Raspberry Pi3) and Amazon elastic cloud. Evaluations based on two real-world social sensing applications show that the new framework can well satisfy real-time Quality-of-Service requirements of the applications and provide much higher payoffs to edge devices compared to the state-of-the-arts.","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2018.00025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2018.00025","endPage":"259","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566118/8567645/08567670.pdf","startPage":"243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative-Competitive Task Allocation in Edge Computing for Delay-Sensitive Social Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567670/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative-Competitive Task Allocation in Edge Computing for Delay-Sensitive Social Sensing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18344080","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567670/","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative-Competitive Task Allocation in Edge Computing for Delay-Sensitive Social Sensing","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"944500a243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.158838S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566118","isNumber":"8567645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566118","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8567645","articleId":"8567670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567671,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Rausch","affiliation":["Distributed Systems Group, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Rausch","id":"37284744200"},{"name":"Cosmin Avasalcai","affiliation":["Distributed Systems Group, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Cosmin","lastName":"Avasalcai","id":"37086258209"},{"name":"Schahram Dustdar","affiliation":["Distributed Systems Group, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Schahram","lastName":"Dustdar","id":"37267275000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9445-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9446-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567671","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":394},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computers","Cloud computing","Energy consumption","Edge computing","Computer architecture","Prototypes","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","distributed processing","energy consumption","optimisation","pattern clustering","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["portable energy-aware cluster-based edge computers","computational resources","edge computing","operational scale","resource-constrained environments","real-time energy-awareness","resource-consumption characteristics","energy-consumption optimization","cluster prototype","data analytics application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["edge computing","edge computers","energy efficiency"]}],"abstract":"Computational resources distributed at the edge of the network are the fundamental infrastructural component of edge computing. The operational scale of edge computing introduces new challenges for building and operating suitable computation platforms. Many application scenarios require edge computing resources to provide reliable response times while operating in dynamic and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for energy-aware, cluster-based edge computers that are designed to be portable and usable in fieldwork scenarios. We use compact general-purpose commodity hardware to build a high-density cluster prototype, and implement a power-management runtime to enable real-time energy-awareness. Furthermore, we present an experimental analysis of the energy and resource-consumption characteristics of our prototype in the context of a data analytics application. The results show the feasibility of our prototype for the presented scenarios, but also reveal the intricacies of power-management approaches already built into modern CPUs. We show that different load balancing policies and cluster configurations have a significant impact on energy consumption and system responsiveness. Our insights lay the groundwork for future research on energy-consumption optimization approaches for cluster-based edge computers.","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2018.00026","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566118/8567645/08567671.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2018.00026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567645","startPage":"260","endPage":"272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Portable Energy-Aware Cluster-Based Edge Computers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Portable Energy-Aware Cluster-Based Edge Computers","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567671/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18344098","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567671/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Portable Energy-Aware Cluster-Based Edge Computers","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"944500a260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114961S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566118","isNumber":"8567645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566118","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8567645","articleId":"8567671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567675,"authors":[{"name":"Tayebeh Bahreini","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University"],"firstName":"Tayebeh","lastName":"Bahreini","id":"37086380979"},{"name":"Hossein Badri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Badri","id":"37086381118"},{"name":"Daniel Grosu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Grosu","id":"37273679100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9445-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9446-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567675","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":888},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Pricing","Edge computing","Cloud computing","Servers","Mobile handsets","Cost accounting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","combinatorial mathematics","computational complexity","optimisation","pricing","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["auction models","resource allocation","pricing","two-level edge computing system","auction-based mechanism","combinatorial auctions","envy-free allocations","envy-free auction mechanism","mobile users","mobile edge computing systems","MEC","edge-cloud resources"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["edge computing, resource allocation, pricing"]}],"abstract":"One of the major challenges in Mobile Edge Computing~(MEC) systems is to decide how to allocate and price edge/cloud resources so that a given system's objective, such as revenue or social welfare, is optimized. One promising approach is to allocate these resources based on auction models, in which users place bids for using a certain amount of resources. In this paper, we address the problem of resource allocation and pricing in a two-level edge computing system. We consider a system in which servers with different capacities are located in the cloud or at the edge of the network. Mobile users compete for these resources and have heterogeneous demands. We design an auction-based mechanism that allocates and prices edge/cloud resources. The proposed mechanism is novel in the sense that it handles the allocation of resources available at the two-levels of the system by combining features from both position and combinatorial auctions. We show that the proposed mechanism is individually-rational and produces envy-free allocations. The first property guarantees that users are willing to participate in the mechanism, while the second guarantees that when the auction is finished, no user would be happier with the outcome of another user. We evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism by performing extensive experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanism is scalable and obtains efficient solutions.","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2018.00030","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566118/8567645/08567675.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2018.00030","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Envy-Free Auction Mechanism for Resource Allocation in Edge Computing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"An Envy-Free Auction Mechanism for Resource Allocation in Edge Computing Systems","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18344117","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567675/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Envy-Free Auction Mechanism for Resource Allocation in Edge Computing Systems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"944500a313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101666S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566118","isNumber":"8567645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566118","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8567645","articleId":"8567675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8567680,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Li","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Li","id":"37085777168"},{"name":"Xiaolong Ma","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolong","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086084313"},{"name":"Zhulin An","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhulin","lastName":"An","id":"37647592100"},{"name":"Yongjun Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongjun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37403526100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9445-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9446-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567680","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":682},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deep Neural Network Compression Algorithm Based on Knowledge Transfer for Edge Device","abstract":"The computation and storage capacity of the edge device are limited, which seriously restrict the application of deep neural network in the device. Toward to the intelligent application of the edge device, we introduce the deep neural network compression algorithm based on knowledge transfer, a three-stage pipeline: lightweight, multi-level knowledge transfer and pruning that reduce the network depth, parameter and operation complexity of the deep learning neural networks. We lighten the neural networks by using a global average pooling layer instead of a fully connected layer and replacing a standard convolution with separable convolutions. Next, the multi-level knowledge transfer minimizes the difference between the output of the \"student network\" and the \"teacher network\" in the middle and logits layer, increasing the supervised information when training the \"student network\". Lastly, we prune the network by cuts off the unimportant convolution kernels with a global iterative pruning strategy.","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2018.00035","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","startPage":"334","endPage":"335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2018.00035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567645","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566118/8567645/08567680.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Convolution","Knowledge transfer","Kernel","Compression algorithms","Cloud computing","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","distributed processing","iterative methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning neural networks","global average pooling layer","global iterative pruning strategy","convolution kernels","teacher network","student network","multilevel knowledge transfer","neural networks","deep neural network compression algorithm","edge device"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["edge device, deep learning, neural network compression, knowledge transfer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Deep Neural Network Compression Algorithm Based on Knowledge Transfer for Edge Device","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567680/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8567680/","accessionNumber":"18362523","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deep Neural Network Compression Algorithm Based on Knowledge Transfer for Edge Device","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"944500a334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039042S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566118","isNumber":"8567645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566118","xplore-issue":"8567645","articleId":"8567680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":8567683,"authors":[{"name":"Jacob Hochstetler","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Hochstetler","id":"37086156250"},{"name":"Rahul Padidela","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Padidela","id":"37086557141"},{"name":"Qi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086562907"},{"name":"Qing Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086059240"},{"name":"Song Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Fu","id":"37086562288"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9445-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9446-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567683","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2567},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded Deep Learning for Vehicular Edge Computing","abstract":"The accuracy of object recognition has been greatly improved due to the rapid development of deep learning, but the deep learning generally requires a lot of training data and the training process is very slow and complex.

Prototype implementation demonstrated the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed MEC-based solution for real-world Web AR development and deployment.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567686","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Servers","Bandwidth","Performance evaluation","Edge computing","Augmented reality","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["augmented reality","mobile computing","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web-based Augmented Reality","Web AR applications","Mobile Edge Computing paradigm","MEC-based collaborative Web AR solution","edge server","MEC-based solution","Web AR implementations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile Augmented Reality","Web based Augmented Reality","Cloud Computing","Mobile Edge Computing"]}],"publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566118/8567645/08567686.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2018.00041","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2018.00041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Edge Computing \u2013 a Booster for the Practical Provisioning Approach of Web-Based Augmented Reality","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567686/","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Edge Computing \u2013 a Booster for the Practical Provisioning Approach of Web-Based Augmented Reality","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18344108","htmlLink":"/document/8567686/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Edge Computing \u2013 a Booster for the Practical Provisioning Approach of Web-Based Augmented Reality","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"944500a349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035177S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566118","isNumber":"8567645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566118","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8567645","articleId":"8567686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567687,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Samanta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Samanta","id":"37085759138"},{"name":"Yong Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Li","id":"37086219454"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9445-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9446-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567687","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1039},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Edge computing","Mobile handsets","Optimization","Delays","Cloud computing","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex networks","distributed processing","incentive schemes","mobile radio","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile edge computing","latency-oblivious incentive service offloading scheme","future mobile services","complex network service management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge Computing","Incentive Service Offloading","Latency Oblivious"]}],"abstract":"We design a latency-oblivious incentive service offloading scheme to manage complex network services for future mobile services.

The edge nodes in the infrastructure reduce the network latency of the cloud computing model and increase data privacy by offloading the sensitive computation from the cloud to the edge. Recent research focuses on the applications and performance of the edge computing, but less attention is paid to the security of this new computing paradigm. Inspired by the recent move of hardware vendors that introducing hardware-assisted Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), we believe applying these TEEs on the edge nodes would be a natural choice to secure the computation and sensitive data on these nodes. In this paper, we investigate the typical hardware-assisted TEEs and evaluate the performance of these TEEs to help analyze the feasibility of deploying them on the edge platforms. Our experiments show that the performance overhead introduced by the TEEs is low, which indicates that integrating these TEEs into the edge nodes can efficiently mitigate security loopholes with a low-performance overhead.","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566118/8567645/08567702.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preliminary Study of Trusted Execution Environments on Heterogeneous Edge Platforms","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2018.00057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2018.00057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Preliminary Study of Trusted Execution Environments on Heterogeneous Edge Platforms","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18344093","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567702/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preliminary Study of Trusted Execution Environments on Heterogeneous Edge Platforms","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"944500a421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063889S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566118","isNumber":"8567645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566118","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8567645","articleId":"8567702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567704,"authors":[{"name":"Baiyi Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The George Washington University, Washington D.C., USA"],"firstName":"Baiyi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086153285"},{"name":"Xiuzhen Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The George Washington University, Washington D.C., USA"],"firstName":"Xiuzhen","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37086027547"},{"name":"Yuan Cao","affiliation":["College of Internet of Things Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Cao","id":"37072459300"},{"name":"Le Zhang","affiliation":["College of Internet of Things Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086563887"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9445-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9446-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567704","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Reliability","Machine learning","Edge computing","Support vector machines","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data privacy","learning (artificial intelligence)","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lightweight hardware","fog computing","lightweight authentication schemes","machine learning attacks","resource-constrained end-user devices","PUF","cloud computing","feedback loop","CRP","challenge response pair","confidential information privacy","physical unclonable function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical Unclonable Function","Lightweight Authentication","Machine learning attack"]}],"abstract":"Fog computing is a new paradigm that extends cloud computing to the network edges. As data processing, communications, and control are performed more closely to the end-user devices in fog computing, chances for the attackers to gain unauthorized accesses to sensitive data have been greatly increased. In this paper, we propose a new resource-efficient physical unclonable function (PUF) based authentication scheme to protect the security and privacy of the confidential information in edge devices. Unlike other PUF based lightweight authentication schemes, our proposed method remarkably increases the machine learning attack time without requiring a server to store a large amount of challenge response pairs (CRPs). Besides, a new strong PUF with feedback loop is employed in our scheme to further resist the machine learning attacks that have demonstrated efficacy in compromising strong PUFs. Our proof-of-concept implementation shows that the proposed scheme is suitable for resource-constrained end-user devices in terms of memory, computation, and security.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lightweight Hardware Based Secure Authentication Scheme for Fog Computing","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2018.00059","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566118/8567645/08567704.pdf","startPage":"433","endPage":"439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2018.00059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Lightweight Hardware Based Secure Authentication Scheme for Fog Computing","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8567704/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Oct 2018","accessionNumber":"18344082","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightweight Hardware Based Secure Authentication Scheme for Fog Computing","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"944500a433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073446S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8566118","isNumber":"8567645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8566118","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8567645","articleId":"8567704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567705,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Alrowaily","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Alrowaily","id":"37086556895"},{"name":"Zhuo Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Zhuo","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086093109"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9445-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9446-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567705","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3042},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567705","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Edge computing","Task analysis","Computer architecture","Internet of Things","Sensors","Password"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Things","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["big data analytics","data processing","security risk mitigation techniques","edge computing security","IoT","distributed edge computing system","distributed edge computing system reliability","scalable distributed edge computing system scalability","network system design security","smart parking","content delivery network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge computing, Security, Internet of Things (IoT)"]}],"abstract":"Today, the architectures for efficient and secure network system designs, such as Internet of Things (IoT) and big data analytics, are growing at a faster pace than ever before.

Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) technology has been selected as the key techniques in 802.11ax. However, the existing OFDMA technology has an interference diffusion problem, i.e., multi-user parallel transmission aggravates the interference to the surrounding cells. To solve these problems, we propose a spatial clustering group-based OFDMA protocol (SCG-OFDMA). In the SCG-OFDMA protocol, the concurrent transmission of nodes with close spatial distance can reduce the degree of interference diffusion. Particularly, the SCG-OFDMA protocol and process are designed based on the 802.11ax Multi-User (MU) MAC framework. The computer simulation analysis results demonstrate an improvement in the throughput of 36.62% at most.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Clustering Group-Based OFDMA Multiple Access Protocol with Carrier Sensing for the Next-generation WLANs","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2018.8567753","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543255/8567612/08567753.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2018.8567753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Clustering Group-Based OFDMA Multiple Access Protocol with Carrier Sensing for the Next-generation WLANs","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8567753/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18324482","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Clustering Group-Based OFDMA Multiple Access Protocol with Carrier Sensing for the Next-generation WLANs","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"1388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053046S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543255","isNumber":"8567612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543255","xplore-issue":"8567612","articleId":"8567753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8567758,"authors":[{"name":"Dezhi Wang","affiliation":["College of Meteorology and Oceanography, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Dezhi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085517064"},{"name":"Lilun Zhang","affiliation":["College of Meteorology and Oceanography, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Lilun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085776257"},{"name":"Zengquan Lu","affiliation":["College of Meteorology and Oceanography, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zengquan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086318001"},{"name":"Kele Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Kele","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085784793"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7946-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7945-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7947-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567758","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Whales","Feature extraction","Computer architecture","Computational modeling","Task analysis","Acoustics","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","audio signal processing","convolution","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural net architecture","signal classification","zoology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNN architectures","CNN models","whalecall classification task","audio sensors","open-source acoustic dataset","higher level abstract representations","whale sub-populations","deep neural network models","large-scale whale-call classification task","audio analysis","deep learning methods","deep learning techniques","deep convolutional neural network architectures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["whale call classification","convolutional neural network","deep learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567758","abstract":"As the rapid development of deep learning techniques, extensive interest has been taken into the applications of deep learning methods on challenging problems of different domains. In view of the recent success of convolutional neural network (CNN) in various tasks of audio analysis, a comparative performance study of different the-state-of-the-art CNN architectures on a large-scale whale-call classification task is investigated in this paper. On the basis of deep neural network models, distinctive features of whale sub-populations are extracted to obtain higher level abstract representations for the accurate classification, which is significantly superior to the traditional classification approaches using manual features based on expert knowledge. In particular, a large open-source acoustic dataset recorded by audio sensors carried by whales in different locations is employed for performance comparison. Based on the experiments, it is found that the advancement of popular CNN architectures significantly improve the accuracy on the whalecall classification task. The accuracy and computational efficiency varies with the change of the CNN architectures. Xception provides the best performance among all four CNN architectures while an ensemble of CNN models can produce even better results.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2018.8567758","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543255/8567612/08567758.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2018.8567758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-Scale Whale Call Classification Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network Architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Large-Scale Whale Call Classification Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network Architectures","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18309215","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567758/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-Scale Whale Call Classification Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network Architectures","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"1231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08082S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543255","isNumber":"8567612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543255","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8567612","articleId":"8567758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8567759,"authors":[{"name":"Tianyun Wang","affiliation":["China Satellite Maritime Tracking and Control Department, Jiangyin, P.R.

The convolutional neural network (CNN), which is beneficial in fields such as imaging and voice analysis, is a type of representative algorithm of artificial intelligence. Increasing fields of study are introducing CNN into their research. However, CNN primarily handle image data, which is entirely different from the data form generated in other fields of study. Blindly processing the data by directly using CNN leads to incorrect training results or instances where training efficiency is too low. In this study, we use the idea of\u201cmaking data fit model putting forward CNN based on data visualization, named V-CNN. V-CNN integrates the data visualization front before CNN model so that the data in the system is suitable for the CNN, which is, in turn, suitable for image recognition. This article further uses intelligent network intrusion detection as an example to verify the V-CNN performance. The results show that all the four categories of invasion of the AWID data set in each type of the recall rate is more than 99.8%, which is significantly better than that in the existing literature. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first to propose V-CNN based on data visualization. V-CNN is general to handle data from almost all fields.

However, the mmWave band will experience much more propagation loss than a low frequency band. Therefore, a mmWave system will adopt beamforming techniques to compensate the high propagation. Moreover, hybrid beamforming which combines analog precoder and digital beamforming is a potential candidate for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems with massive scale for mmWave band because of its low hardware complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel beam selection method that ensures the service quality of user equipment (UE) and mitigates any interference between equipments to provide near performance upper bound and the method overcomes the high costs and complexity of mmWave systems. We evaluate the advantage of the proposed method via sum-rate and complexity computations. Simulation results show that the proposed method can offer significant reductions for massive-scale MIMO mmWave systems. In general, we show that the proposed method achieves a high quality solution, which is almost the same as the performance upper bound.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567785/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18324558","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567785/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Beam Selection for Hybrid Precoded Multi-User mmWave Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Beam Selection for Hybrid Precoded Multi-User mmWave Communications","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"1366.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095884S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543255","isNumber":"8567612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543255","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8567612","articleId":"8567785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8567795,"authors":[{"name":"Li Chenning","affiliation":["Xi\u2019an Guide Technology Co., Ltd, Xi\u2019An, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Chenning","id":"37086544291"},{"name":"Yang Ting","affiliation":["Xi\u2019an Guide Technology Co., Ltd, Xi\u2019An, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Ting","id":"37086546608"},{"name":"Zhang Qian","affiliation":["Xi\u2019an Guide Technology Co., Ltd, Xi\u2019An, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Qian","id":"37086547091"},{"name":"Xu Haowei","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019An, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Haowei","id":"37085648235"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7946-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7945-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7947-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567795","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567795","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Feature extraction","Cameras","Convolutional neural networks","Image segmentation","Navigation","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cartography","convolution","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image classification","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["objects location","location solutions","range-based localization method","object-based indoor localization method","region-based convolutional neural networks","pre-trained R-CNN","template images","indoor environment","template matching","digital map"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor Localization","Visual-based Navigation","Convolutional Neural Network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2018.8567795","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543255/8567612/08567795.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2018.8567795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object-based Indoor Localization using Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"This study presents a novel method that utilizes Region-based Convolution Neural Network (R-CNN) for identifying objects in an image, and then, localizes the image using a pre-stored map of these objects. The algorithm follows the next steps. First, an image, taken by a smart phone, is uploaded to the server, where a pre-trained R-CNN and template images are combined to identify the objects in the image. In the second step, the location of the image is derived according to the spatial relationships of the objects in the image with a prior knowledge of the objects location in a digital map. Finally, if more than one location solutions are obtained from the previous step, a range-based localization method is utilized to eliminate the wrong results. To prove the concept, a test is conducted in typical yet challenging indoor environment.

The wide bandwidth and long duration signals can use matched filtering technique to obtain high resolution. The output signal of the matched filter has a mainlobe and a series of sidelobes on the time axis. Under multi-target environment, we expect that the target signal has good range resolution, and the main-lobe of the weak target echo is not submerged by the sidelobes of the strong interference. Low sidelobe level can be achieved by the joint processing of the matched filter and sidelobe suppressor. The traditional sidelobe suppressor based on time-domain or frequency-domain weighting method often sacrifices the main-lobe width, and degrades the range resolution. In this paper, the matched filter output of the multi-target echo is derived as the convolution operation of the reference signal (the autocorrelation function of the transmit signal) and the objective function (the multi-target unit impulse response function). The Lucy-Richardson iterative algorithm is used to realize the process of deconvolution to solve the objective function. We take the objective function as final output of the deconvolution matched filtering to achieve the high range resolution and low sidelobe level. The performance of active sonar deconvolution matched filtering method is validated by simulation and sea trial data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567801/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2018","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567801/","accessionNumber":"18324532","displayDocTitle":"Active Sonar Deconvolution Matched Filtering Method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Sonar Deconvolution Matched Filtering Method","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"1189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071772S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543255","isNumber":"8567612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543255","xplore-issue":"8567612","articleId":"8567801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8567818,"authors":[{"name":"Dahao Jian","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dahao","lastName":"Jian","id":"37086545253"},{"name":"Haixia Wu","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haixia","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086399039"},{"name":"Wei Gao","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086545440"},{"name":"Rongkun Jiang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rongkun","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086296099"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7946-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7945-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7947-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8567818","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":330},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Correlation","Training","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","computational complexity","correlation methods","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay correlation","symmetrical correlation properties","timing efficiency","calculation time","timing estimation performance","timing synchronization method","CAZAC sequence","OFDM systems","timing synchronization algorithm","Constant Amplitude Zero Auto-Correlation sequence","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing systems","training symbol","computational complexity","mean-square error","MSE","mean timing offset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","timing synchronization","CAZAC","low computational complexity."]}],"abstract":"A new timing synchronization algorithm based on Constant Amplitude Zero Auto-Correlation (CAZAC) sequence for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems is proposed in this paper.

Owing to the restrictions of the Nyquist sampling theorem, it is difficult to improve both specifications simultaneously. The increase of the swath width often leads to the decrease of the spatial resolution, e.g., in scanning SAR and terrain observation with progressive scan SAR. For a sparse scene, an image containing only a few targets has massive data but little useful information. This paper proposes a novel SAR observation mode, AgileSAR, which is based on the time\u2013space sampling method and can overcome the limitations of the Nyquist theorem. It also increases the swath width while preserving the resolution of the sparse scene. AgileSAR steers the antenna beam towards a different sub-swath, generally after one or two pulse intervals, and the average pulse repetition rate corresponding to every sub-swath is much lower than that determined by the Nyquist theorem. Compared with Sentinel-1, which can achieve 5-m resolution and 80-km swath, a single azimuth-channel AgileSAR system can achieve 5-m resolution and 300-km swath for a sparse scene, once the corresponding system parameters are designed.

Multiple UAVs can carry out complex tasks efficiently when they are organized as an ad hoc network, where wireless communication is essential for cooperation and collaboration between UAVs and the ground station. Due to rapid mobility and highly dynamic topology, designing a routing protocol for UAV networks is a challenging task. As the number of UAVs increases, a hierarchical routing called clustering is necessarily required to provide scalability because clustering schemes ensure the basic level of system performance such as throughput, end-to-end delay, and energy efficiency. For approximately a half-decade, several survey articles have been reported on topology-based routing and position-based routing for UAV networks. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, however, there is no survey on cluster-based routing in the literature. In this paper, cluster-based routing protocols for UAV networks are extensively surveyed and qualitatively compared in terms of outstanding features, characteristics, competitive advantages, and limitations. Furthermore, open research issues and challenges on cluster-based routing are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885539","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08567887.pdf","startPage":"498","endPage":"516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on Cluster-Based Routing Protocols for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Cluster-Based Routing Protocols for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks","volume":"7","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2019","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","htmlLink":"/document/8567887/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"NRF-2016R1D1A1A09918974"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Survey on Cluster-Based Routing Protocols for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks","sourcePdf":"access-moh-2885539-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119432S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8567887","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8567891,"authors":[{"name":"Long Jin","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8567891/jin-2885527-small.gif","p":["Long Jin (M\u201917) received the B.E. degree in automation and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2011 and 2016, respectively.

However, wine regions may directly affect the quality and taste of the wine, and misjudgment of the wine regions leads to confusion for dealers and consumers in choosing wine types. In recent decades, different methods in machine learning have been presented and investigated the pattern classification. In this paper, based on the existing results, a modified multi-output Chebyshev-polynomial feed-forward neural network (MOCPFFNN) is presented, analyzed, and applied to the pattern classification of wines regions. According to the orthogonal polynomial theory, the activation functions of the MOCPFFNN are improved to some Chebyshev polynomials. In addition, to have a lower computational complexity, the presented neural network model is automatically determined by the eight-fold cross validation (8FCV) algorithm and the weight direct determination (WDD) algorithm. Finally, comparisons are made among the presented model and other classical methods, e.g., feed-forward back propagation (FFBP), layer recurrent neural network (LRNN), and nonlinear auto regressive with exogenous inputs (NARX), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, which confirm that the modified MOCPFFNN has the best approximation and generalization performance in the pattern classification of wine regions, with the accuracy rates of the training set and test set reaching 99.17% and 94.83%, respectively. Moreover, the variance of the accuracy of the presented MOCPFFNN method in the experiments is 0, which illustrates its high robustness in pattern classification.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885527","startPage":"1973","endPage":"1980","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08567891.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Modified Multi-Output Chebyshev-Polynomial Feed-Forward Neural Network for Pattern Classification of Wine Regions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567891/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On Modified Multi-Output Chebyshev-Polynomial Feed-Forward Neural Network for Pattern Classification of Wine Regions","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8567891/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61703189"},{"fundingName":"Fund of Key Laboratory of IoT of Qinghai Province","grantNumber":"2017-ZJ-Y21"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Outstanding Young Teacher Training Program in Higher School","grantNumber":"YQ2015104"},{"fundingName":"Guangzhou Higher School Innovation and Entrepreneurship Education Project","grantNumber":"2017153201"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004775","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province","grantNumber":"18JR3RA264"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004735","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of\u00a0Hunan Province","grantNumber":"2017JJ3257"},{"fundingName":"Research Foundation of Education Bureau of Hunan Province, China","grantNumber":"17C1299"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012899","fundingName":"Lanzhou University","grantNumber":"2018ldbryb020"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"lzujbky-2017-37"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61873304, 51775054 and 11701209"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2018M641784"},{"fundingName":"Fund of Jilin Province Science and Technology","grantNumber":"JJKH20181012KJ and JJKH20180462KJ"},{"fundingName":"Project of Science and Technology Development Plan for Jilin Province","grantNumber":"2016052010JH"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On Modified Multi-Output Chebyshev-Polynomial Feed-Forward Neural Network for Pattern Classification of Wine Regions","sourcePdf":"access-jin-2885527-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082512S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8567891","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8567899,"authors":[{"name":"Iram Nadeem","affiliation":["Communication and Wave Propagation Laboratory, Chosun University, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8567899/nadee-2885558-small.gif","p":["Iram Nadeem received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the M.S. degree in telecommunication engineering (major in optical fiber communication) from the University of Engineering and Technology Taxila, Pakistan, in 2010 and 2014, respectively, and the M.Eng. degree in information and communication engineering from Chosun University, South Korea, in 2018.

This paper provides a theoretical review of different mutual coupling reduction techniques in MIMO antenna systems. The increase in the mutual coupling can affect the antenna characteristics drastically and therefore degrades the performance of the MIMO systems. It is possible to improve the performance partially by calibrating the mutual coupling in the digital domain. However, the simple and effective approach is to use the techniques, such as defected ground structure, parasitic or slot element, complementary split ring resonator, and decoupling networks which can overcome the mutual coupling effects by means of physical implementation. An extensive discussion on the basis of different mutual coupling reduction techniques, their examples, and comparative study is still rare in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, different MIMO antenna design techniques and all of their mutual coupling reduction techniques through various structures and mechanisms are presented with multiple examples and characteristics comparison.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885558","startPage":"563","endPage":"586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08567899.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on Mutual Coupling Reduction Technique for MIMO Antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567899/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"Study on Mutual Coupling Reduction Technique for MIMO Antennas","volume":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","htmlLink":"/document/8567899/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Study on Mutual Coupling Reduction Technique for MIMO Antennas","sourcePdf":"access-choi-2885558-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.233583S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8567899","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8567900,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless Communication of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunication, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8567900/liu-2885535-small.gif","p":["Yang Liu (M\u201918) was born in Wuxi, Jiangsu, China, in 1988.

This paper proposes a multitask learning algorithm for cell detection and segmentation using CNNs. We use dot annotations placed inside each cell indicating approximate cell centroids to create training datasets for the detection and segmentation tasks. The segmentation task is used to map the input image to foreground versus background regions, whereas the detection task is used to predict the centroids of the cells. Our multitask model shares convolutional layers between the two tasks, while having task-specific output layers. Learning two tasks simultaneously reduces the risks of overfitting and also helps in separating overlapping cells better. We also introduce a similarity interface (SI) that can be integrated with our multitask network to allow easy adaptation between domains, and to compensate for the variability in contrast and texture of cells seen in microscopy images. The SI comprises an unsupervised first layer in combination with a neighborhood similarity layer (NSL). A layer of logistic sigmoid functions is used as an unsupervised first layer to separate clustered image patches from each other. The NSL transforms its input feature map at a given pixel by computing its similarity to the surrounding neighborhood. Our proposed method achieves higher/comparable detection and segmentation scores as compared to recent state-of-the-art methods with significantly reduced effort for generating training data.","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2018.2885544","startPage":"1457","endPage":"1468","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/8752487/08567919.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2018.2885544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8752487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cell Segmentation Using a Similarity Interface With a Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Task analysis","Training","Microscopy","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","object detection","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitask convolutional neural network","cell segmentation","pixel-level ground truth annotations","multitask learning algorithm","cell detection","dot annotations","multitask model shares convolutional layers","task-specific output layers","similarity interface","multitask network","neighborhood similarity layer","cell centroids","clustered image patches","NSL","logistic sigmoid functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural networks","segmentation","detection","multitask learning","appearance invariance"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Animals","CHO Cells","Cricetinae","Cricetulus","Cytological Techniques","HeLa Cells","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Mice","Neural Networks, Computer","Unsupervised Machine Learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567919/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","displayDocTitle":"Cell Segmentation Using a Similarity Interface With a Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Network","volume":"23","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8567919/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2019","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18991757","pubMedId":"30530343","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cell Segmentation Using a Similarity Interface With a Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Network","sourcePdf":"jbhi-ramesh-2885544-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119892S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"8752487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8752487","articleId":"8567919","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8567925,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Manuel Gonzalez","affiliation":["Departamento de Tecnolog\u00eda Electr\u00f3nica, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Bilbao, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8635030/8567925/gonza-2883568-small.gif","p":["Jose Manuel Gonzalez received the M.Sc. degree from ENSEEIHT, Toulouse, France, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in high-frequency electronics from the Universit\u00e9 de Limoges, Limoges, France, and Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada, in 2011.","In 2012, he joined KAUST, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia, as a Post-Doctoral Researcher.

In this paper, a non connectorized measurement technique is presented to obtain the low-frequency critical poles at internal nodes of a hybrid amplifier. The experimental setup uses a high-impedance probe connected to a vector network analyzer to obtain a fully calibrated closed-loop frequency response that is identified to get the poles of the device at low frequency. Compared to previous connectorized solutions, the approach avoids the ad hoc insertion of extra RF connectors to access the low-frequency dynamics of the amplifier. In addition, it simplifies the characterization at multiple internal nodes, which is worthwhile for an efficient detection and fixing of critical low-frequency dynamics in multistage power amplifiers. The technique is first applied to dc steady-state regimes and compared to the connectorized approach on a single-stage amplifier. Next, it is applied to a three-stage amplifier to show its potential to detect the origin of the undesired dynamics and the most effective way to increase stability margin. Finally, the technique has been extended to the large-signal case to increase its usefulness for the design and diagnosis of high-power amplifiers.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2018.2883568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2018.2883568","startPage":"822","endPage":"833","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8635030/08567925.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8635030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In-Circuit Characterization of Low-Frequency Stability Margins in Power Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"In-Circuit Characterization of Low-Frequency Stability Margins in Power Amplifiers","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2019","volume":"67","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8567925/","accessionNumber":"18452208","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567925/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad","grantNumber":"TEC2015-67217-R"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005004","fundingName":"Ekonomiaren Garapen eta Lehiakortasun Saila, Eusko Jaurlaritza","grantNumber":"IT1104-16"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-Circuit Characterization of Low-Frequency Stability Margins in Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tmtt-gonzalezperez-2883568-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069232S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8635030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8635030","articleId":"8567925","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8567928,"authors":[{"name":"Jingyang Fang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8736077/8567928/fang-2885513-small.gif","p":["Jingyang Fang (S\u201915) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2018.","From May 2018 to August 2018, he was a Visiting Scholar with the Institute of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.

The lack of inertia becomes a main challenge to small-scale modern power systems in terms of control and stability. To alleviate adverse effects from inertia reductions, e.g., undesirable load shedding and cascading failures, three-phase grid-connected power converters should provide virtual inertia upon system demands. This can be achieved by directly linking the grid frequency and voltage references of dc-link capacitors/ultracapacitors. This paper reveals that the virtual inertia control may possibly induce instabilities to the power converters under weak grid conditions, which is caused by the coupling between the d- and q-axes as well as the inherent differential operator introduced by the virtual inertia control. To tackle this instability issue, this paper proposes a modified virtual inertia control to mitigate the differential effect, and thus, alleviating the coupling effect to a great extent. Experimental verifications are provided, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control in stabilizing three-phase grid-connected power converters for inertia emulation even when connected to the weak grid.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8736077/08567928.pdf","startPage":"8660","endPage":"8670","publicationTitle":"IEEE

recent advances in state estimation, perception, and navigation algorithms have significantly contributed to the ubiquitous use of quadrotors for inspection, mapping, and aerial imaging. To further increase the versatility of quadrotors, recent works investigated the use of an adaptive morphology, which consists of modifying the shape of the vehicle during flight to suit a specific task or environment. However, these works either increase the complexity of the platform or decrease its controllability. In this letter, we propose a novel, simpler, yet effective morphing design for quadrotors consisting of a frame with four independently rotating arms that fold around the main frame. To guarantee stable flight at all times, we exploit an optimal control strategy that adapts on the fly to the drone morphology. We demonstrate the versatility of the proposed adaptive morphology in different tasks, such as negotiation of narrow gaps, close inspection of vertical surfaces, and object grasping and transportation. The experiments are performed on an actual, fully autonomous quadrotor relying solely on onboard visual-inertial sensors and compute. No external motion tracking systems and computers are used. This is the first work showing stable flight without requiring any symmetry of the morphology.","doi":"10.1109/LRA.2018.2885575","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7083369/8581687/08567932.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8581687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2018.2885575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Foldable Drone: A Morphing Quadrotor That Can Squeeze and Fly","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","displayDocTitle":"The Foldable Drone: A Morphing Quadrotor That Can Squeeze and Fly","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567932/","publicationDate":"April 2019","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18329082","htmlLink":"/document/8567932/","volume":"4","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Swiss National Science Foundation through the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) Robotics, and the SNSF-ERC Starting Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Foldable Drone: A Morphing Quadrotor That Can Squeeze and Fly","sourcePdf":"lra-falanga-2885575-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136421S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7083369","isNumber":"8581687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7083369","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8581687","articleId":"8567932","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8567933,"authors":[{"name":"He Ming Yao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"He Ming","lastName":"Yao","orcid":"0000-0003-2814-9539","id":"37085730438"},{"name":"Lijun Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Lijun","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37272130700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"8567933","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1203},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Computational modeling","Neurons","Data models","Numerical models","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","mathematics computing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine-learning-based PML","FDTD method","finite-difference time-domain","hyperbolic tangent basis function neural network","FDTD solving process","computation complexity","artificial neural network model","absorbing boundary condition computation","perfectly matched layer ABC","HTBF-based PML model training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)","hyperbolic tangent basis function (HTBF) neural network","machine learning","perfectly matched layer (PML)"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a novel absorbing boundary condition (ABC) computation method for finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) is proposed based on the machine learning approach. The hyperbolic tangent basis function (HTBF) neural network is introduced to replace traditional perfectly matched layer (PML) ABC during the FDTD solving process. The field data on the interface of conventional PML are employed to train HTBF-based PML model. Compared to the conventional approach, the novel method greatly decreases the size of a computation domain and the computation complexity of FDTD because the new model only involves the one-cell boundary layer.

Deep learning methods have advantages over traditional approaches for cell event detection due to their ability to capture more discriminative features of cellular processes. Supervised deep learning methods, however, are inherently limited due to the scarcity of annotated data. Unsupervised deep learning methods have shown promise in general (non-cell) videos because they can learn the visual appearance and motion of regularly occurring events. Cell videos, however, can have rapid, irregular changes in cell appearance and motion, such as during cell division and death, which are often the events of most interest. We propose a novel unsupervised two-path input neural network architecture to capture these irregular events with three key elements: 1) a visual encoding path to capture regular spatiotemporal patterns of observed objects with convolutional long short-term memory units; 2) an event detection path to extract information related to irregular events with max-pooling layers; and 3) integration of the hidden states of the two paths to provide a comprehensive representation of the video that is used to simultaneously locate and classify cell events. We evaluated our network in detecting cell division in densely packed stem cells in phase-contrast microscopy videos. Our unsupervised method achieved higher or comparable accuracy to standard and state-of-the-art supervised methods.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2018.2885572","startPage":"1477","endPage":"1487","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/8727551/08567937.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2018.2885572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8727551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Two-Path Neural Network for Cell Event Detection and Classification Using Spatiotemporal Patterns","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Videos","Event detection","Neural networks","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","cellular biophysics","feature extraction","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","neurophysiology","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell division","densely packed stem cells","unsupervised method","two-path neural network","cell event detection","automatic event detection","cell videos","cell populations","supervised deep learning methods","unsupervised deep learning methods","visual appearance","cell appearance","visual encoding path","regular spatiotemporal patterns","event detection path","unsupervised two-path input neural network architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Molecular and cellular imaging","machine learning","cell","unsupervised neural network","pattern recognition and classification"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Aorta","Cattle","Cells, Cultured","Cytological Techniques","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Microscopy","Molecular Imaging","Neural Networks, Computer","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Unsupervised Machine Learning","Video Recording"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567937/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Two-Path Neural Network for Cell Event Detection and Classification Using Spatiotemporal Patterns","volume":"38","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8567937/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2019","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18725750","pubMedId":"30530316","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Two-Path Neural Network for Cell Event Detection and Classification Using Spatiotemporal Patterns","sourcePdf":"tmi-phan-2885572-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123427S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"8727551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8727551","articleId":"8567937","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8567939,"authors":[{"name":"Shuang Li","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-3179-4168","id":"37086640963"},{"name":"Peter J.

This leads to a closed-form approximation of expected per-user signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The analysis is carried out for different base station layouts, including a centralized collocated array and a distributed system with arbitrarily correlated Rayleigh fading. Unlike the digital MRC system, where the performance improves for a more distributed system, we show that analog MRC performs best in a centralized configuration. Furthermore, numerical results show that both analog and digital MRC benefit from a strong line-of-sight (LoS) presence in Ricean fading channels as the Rice K factor reduces the interference power. We show that in a centralized system, the performance of analog and digital MRC converge with increasing K factor, because strong LoS reduces the diversity of incoming signal power utilized by digital MRC. On the other hand, in a distributed system, the performance gap between these two techniques will remain due to the diversity of signal powers. Our closed-form approximation of the expected per-user SINR is general and appropriate for moderate to large numbers of antennas and arbitrary correlation models.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8640274/08567939.pdf","startPage":"1948","endPage":"1952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2885555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2885555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8640274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Analog and Digital MRC for Distributed and Centralized MU-MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Antennas","Uplink","Downlink","Correlation","Diversity reception","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","matched filters","MIMO communication","precoding","radiofrequency interference","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["centralized collocated array","distributed system","arbitrarily correlated Rayleigh fading","digital MRC system","analog MRC","centralized configuration","interference power","signal powers","closed-form approximation","per-user SINR","centralized MU-MIMO systems","per-user signal power","multiuser multiple input multiple output system","analog maximal ratio","expected per-user signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","base station layouts","matched filtering precoding","line-of-sight presence","performance gap"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Expected SINR","analog MRC","digital MRC","spatial correlation","Rice K factor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Analog and Digital MRC for Distributed and Centralized MU-MIMO Systems","volume":"68","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8567939/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18467766","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Analog and Digital MRC for Distributed and Centralized MU-MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-li-2885555-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070348S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8640274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8640274","articleId":"8567939","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8567942,"authors":[{"name":"Sharath Adavanne","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/8688688/8567942/adava-2885636-small.gif","p":["Sharath Adavanne received the M.Sc. degree in information technology from Tampere University of Technology (TUT), Tampere, Finland, in 2011.

The proposed network takes a sequence of consecutive spectrogram time frames as input and maps it to two outputs in parallel. As the first output, the sound event detection (SED) is performed as a multi-label classification task on each time frame producing temporal activity for all the sound event classes. As the second output, localization is performed by estimating the 3-D Cartesian coordinates of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) for each sound event class using multi-output regression. The proposed method is able to associate multiple DOAs with respective sound event labels and further track this association with respect to time. The proposed method uses separately the phase and magnitude component of the spectrogram calculated on each audio channel as the feature, thereby avoiding any method- and array-specific feature extraction. The method is evaluated on five Ambisonic and two circular array format datasets with different overlapping sound events in anechoic, reverberant, and real-life scenarios. The proposed method is compared with two SED, three DOA estimation, and one SELD baselines. The results show that the proposed method is generic and applicable to any array structures, robust to unseen DOA values, reverberation, and low SNR scenarios. The proposed method achieved a consistently higher recall of the estimated number of DOAs across datasets in comparison to the best baseline. Additionally, this recall was observed to be significantly better than the best baseline method for a higher number of overlapping sound events.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2018.2885636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/8688688/08567942.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8688688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2018.2885636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sound Event Localization and Detection of Overlapping Sources Using Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","displayDocTitle":"Sound Event Localization and Detection of Overlapping Sources Using Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567942/","publicationDate":"March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18595916","htmlLink":"/document/8567942/","volume":"13","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010663","fundingName":"H2020 European Research Council","grantNumber":"637422"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sound Event Localization and Detection of Overlapping Sources Using Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"jstsp-adavanne-2885636-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17769S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"8688688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"8688688","articleId":"8567942","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8567945,"authors":[{"name":"Xuejing Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8580441/8567945/xzhan-2885454-small.gif","p":["Xuejing Zhang (S\u201917) was born in Hebei, China.

By using the concept of the optimal weight vector from the adaptive array theory and adding virtual interferences one by one, the change rule of the optimal weight vector is found and a new formulation of the weight vector update is thus devised. Then, the issue of how to precisely control the response level of one single direction is investigated. More specifically, we assign a virtual interference to a direction such that the response level can be precisely controlled. Moreover, the parameters, such as the interference-to-noise ratio, can be figured out according to the desired level. Additionally, the parameter optimization is carried out to obtain the maximal array gain. The resulting scheme is called optimal and precise array response control (OPARC) in this paper. To understand it better, its properties are given, and its comparison with the existing accurate array response control algorithm is provided. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed OPARC.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8580441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2018.2885454","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8580441/08567945.pdf","startPage":"652","endPage":"667","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2018.2885454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OPARC: Optimal and Precise Array Response Control Algorithm\u2014Part I: Fundamentals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2019","displayDocTitle":"OPARC: Optimal and Precise Array Response Control Algorithm\u2014Part I: Fundamentals","volume":"67","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8567945/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2019","accessionNumber":"18364736","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567945/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671139, 61671137, 61771316 and 61701499"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"JCYJ20170302150044331"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OPARC: Optimal and Precise Array Response Control Algorithm\u2014Part I: Fundamentals","sourcePdf":"tsp-zhang-2885454-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.19531S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8580441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8580441","articleId":"8567945","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8567947,"authors":[{"name":"Xuejing Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8580441/8567947/xzhan-2885492-small.gif","p":["Xuejing Zhang (S\u201917) was born in Hebei, China.

The ability for transtibial amputees to use their residual ankle muscles for two control input degrees of freedom (i.e., two independent myoelectric control input sources) for direct neural control depends on the ability for amputees to generate varying magnitudes of reciprocal activation and coactivation using their residual ankle muscles, which is not well understood. In this paper, we aimed to fill this knowledge gap. We asked 12 transtibial amputees to control the 2-D movement of a computer cursor using continuous proportional myoelectric control via their residual plantar flexor and residual dorsiflexor muscles to define their reachable 2-D control input space. The x-y position of the computer cursor was directly proportional to the independent continuous myoelectric control signals from the residual lateral gastrocnemius (x-axis) and the residual tibialis anterior (y-axis) where the limits of each axis were 0%-100% maximum voluntary activation of the corresponding residual muscle. Our results show that the reachable control input space varied widely across amputee subjects ranging from 38% to 81% of the maximum possible control input space. The cumulative time for the amputee subjects to saturate their reachable control input space ranged from 1.95 to 6.85 min. The amputee subjects used different residual muscle activation patterns and coordination strategies to expand their reachable control input space depending on their ability to perform coactivation and reciprocal activation using their residual plantar flexor and dorsiflexor muscles. The future development of powered lower limb prostheses using direct continuous proportional myoelectric control via residual muscles (e.g., for direct voluntary control of prosthesis joint impedance) should consider how an amputee user's immediately accessible residual muscle activation patterns and reachable 2-D control input space may affect their learning and performance.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7333/8606481/8567953-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8567953/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2019","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18360984","pubMedId":"30530332","volume":"27","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Voluntary Control of Residual Antagonistic Muscles in Transtibial Amputees: Reciprocal Activation, Coactivation, and Implications for Direct Neural Control of Powered Lower Limb Prostheses","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"#1406750 and #1361549"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Voluntary Control of Residual Antagonistic Muscles in Transtibial Amputees: Reciprocal Activation, Coactivation, and Implications for Direct Neural Control of Powered Lower Limb Prostheses","sourcePdf":"tnsre-huang-2885641-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057469S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"8606481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8606481","articleId":"8567953","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8567958,"authors":[{"name":"Pham Tien Dat","affiliation":["Network System Research Institute, National Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Pham Tien Dat (M'12) received the B.Eng. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from the Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Vietnam, in 2003, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in science of global information and telecommunication studies from Waseda University, Japan, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

A common approach for designing WiFi-based localization systems is to learn location-to-signal strength mappings for each access point in an environment. Each mapping is then used to compute the likelihood of the robot's location conditioned on sensed signal strength data, yielding as many likelihood functions as mappings are available. Office buildings typically have from several tens to a few hundreds of access points, making it essential to properly combine all available likelihoods into a single, coherent, joint likelihood that yields precise likelihoods, yet is not overconfident. While most research has focused on techniques for learning these mappings and improving data acquisition; research on techniques to adequately fuse them has been neglected. Our approach for data information fusion is based on information theory and yields considerably better joint distributions than previous approaches. Furthermore, through extensive testing, we show that these joint likelihoods considerably increase the system's localization performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Wireless fidelity","Robots","Training","Probabilistic logic","Data models","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","indoor radio","maximum likelihood estimation","sensor fusion","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot location","data acquisition","location-to-signal strength mappings","WiFi-based localization systems","WiFi-based self-localization","multiple access points","information theory","data information fusion","joint likelihood","coherent likelihood","single likelihood","likelihood functions","sensed signal strength data","access point"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensor fusion","localization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567960","doi":"10.1109/LRA.2018.2885583","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7083369/8581687/08567960.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2018.2885583","startPage":"269","endPage":"276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8581687","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Information Fusion From Multiple Access Points for WiFi-Based Self-localization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data Information Fusion From Multiple Access Points for WiFi-Based Self-localization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567960/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","volume":"4","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8567960/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2019","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18371509","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Tough Robotics Challenge, ImPACT Program of the Council for Science, Technology, and Innovation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Information Fusion From Multiple Access Points for WiFi-Based Self-localization","sourcePdf":"lra-miyagusuku-2885583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070467S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7083369","isNumber":"8581687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7083369","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8581687","articleId":"8567960","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8567963,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Shahdloo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Shahdloo","orcid":"0000-0003-1935-3845","id":"37086875637"},{"name":"Efe Ilicak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Efe","lastName":"Ilicak","orcid":"0000-0002-7062-018X","id":"37086192153"},{"name":"Mohammad Tofighi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Tofighi","orcid":"0000-0002-3249-1399","id":"37085338070"},{"name":"Emine U.

CS reconstructions involve one or more regularization parameters that weigh sparsity in transform domains against fidelity to acquired data. While parameter selection is critical for reconstruction quality, the optimal parameters are subject and dataset specific. Thus, commonly practiced heuristic parameter selection generalizes poorly to independent datasets. Recent studies have proposed to tune parameters by estimating the risk of removing significant image coefficients. Line searches are performed across the parameter space to identify the parameter value that minimizes this risk. Although effective, these line searches yield prolonged reconstruction times. Here, we propose a new self-tuning CS method that uses computationally efficient projections onto epigraph sets of the \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\ell }_{{1}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n and total-variation norms to simultaneously achieve parameter selection and regularization.

In TD-MS computation, we demonstrate that the energy to compute is proportional to the importance of the computation.

The BiDANN model is inspired by the neuroscience findings that the left and right hemispheres of human's brain are asymmetric to the emotional response. It contains a global and two local domain discriminators that work adversarially with a classifier to learn discriminative emotional features for each hemisphere. At the same time, it tries to reduce the possible domain differences in each hemisphere between the source and target domains so as to improve the generality of the recognition model. In addition, we also propose an improved version of BiDANN, denoted by BiDANN-S, for subject-independent EEG emotion recognition problem by lowering the influences of the personal information of subjects to the EEG emotion recognition. Extensive experiments on the SEED database are conducted to evaluate the performance of both BiDANN and BiDANN-S. The experimental results have shown that the proposed BiDANN and BiDANN models achieve state-of-the-art performance in the EEG emotion recognition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567966/","volume":"12","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8567966/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 April-June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Bi-Hemisphere Domain Adversarial Neural Network Model for EEG Emotion Recognition","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2015CB351704"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572009 and 61772276"},{"fundingName":"Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu Province, China","grantNumber":"BE2016616"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bi-Hemisphere Domain Adversarial Neural Network Model for EEG Emotion Recognition","sourcePdf":"taffc-zheng-2885474-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.259255S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"9443045","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9443045","articleId":"8567966","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8567968,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Xu","orcid":"0000-0002-9620-2293","id":"37086340824"},{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-7337-1844","id":"37085733739"},{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-5172-4736","id":"37859959900"},{"name":"Yinhe Han","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yinhe","lastName":"Han","orcid":"0000-0003-0904-6681","id":"37280848500"},{"name":"Xuehai Qian","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xuehai","lastName":"Qian","id":"37086058165"},{"name":"Xiaowei Li","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-0874-814X","id":"37280862300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-6056"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6064"},{"format":"CD","value":"2473-2575"}],"articleNumber":"8567968","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2792},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Program processors","Coherence","Computer architecture","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","memory architecture","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PIMSim","PIM simulator","PIM-enabled instructions","energy models","simulation modes","architectural simulation","system-level researches","PIM designs","reliable PIM architecture modeling","heterogeneous aspects","memory research","Process-in-Memory","big data applications","processing-in-memory simulator","PIM coherence","memory devices","in-memory processing logic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Processing-in-memory","simulator","heterogeneous computing","memory system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567968","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/10208/8610345/08567968.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCA.2018.2885752","doi":"10.1109/LCA.2018.2885752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8610345","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PIMSim: A Flexible and Detailed Processing-in-Memory Simulator","abstract":"With the advent of big data applications and new process technologies, Process-in-Memory (PIM) attracts much attention in memory research as the architecture studies gradually shift from processors to heterogeneous aspects.

In the proposed structure, the secondary source signal is rotated by a certain angle and then the source and the secondary best relay transmit the in-phase and the quadrature components of the rotated signal. As a consequence, two source signals, rather than one, are transmitted in two-time slots which improves data rates considerably, compared to the conventional cognitive cooperative schemes. In this paper, proactive relaying mode is used in which the best relay is selected based on the max-min selection criterion before executing the transmission. Considering both statistical and the instantaneous channel state information of the feedback channel between the primary receiver and the secondary network, two power allocation methods are adopted at the source. For both methods, closed-form expressions of error probability are derived. Moreover, asymptotic analysis is performed and diversity gain is obtained to provide further insights about the system performance. Finally, analytical expressions are verified by Monte Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2885593","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8640274/08567976.pdf","startPage":"1953","endPage":"1957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8640274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2885593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Space Cognitive Cooperation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","displayDocTitle":"Signal Space Cognitive Cooperation","volume":"68","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"18467756","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2019","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8567976/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Space Cognitive Cooperation","sourcePdf":"tvt-erdogan-2885593-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062449S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8640274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8640274","articleId":"8567976","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8567980,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Sun","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Deakin University (Waurn Ponds Campus), Geelong, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/8727625/8567980/sun-2885561-small.gif","p":["Nan Sun received the bachelor\u2019s degree (Hons.) in information technology from Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia, in 2016, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Meanwhile, governments, businesses, and individual Internet users show the growing public appetite to improve cyber resilience that refers to their ability to prepare for, combat and recover from cyber threats and incidents. Undoubtedly, predicting cybersecurity incidents is deemed to have excellent potential for proactively advancing cyber resilience. Research communities and industries have begun proposing cybersecurity incident prediction schemes by utilizing different types of data sources, including organization's reports and datasets, network data, synthetic data, data crawled from webpages, and data retrieved from social media. With a focus on the dataset, this survey paper investigates the emerging research by reviewing recent representative works appeared in the dominant period. We also extract and summarize the data-driven research methodology commonly adopted in this fast-growing area. In consonance with the phases of the methodology, each work that predicts cybersecurity incident is comprehensively studied.

The latter are implemented via a chain of virtualized network functions, a process known as Service Function Chaining. In this paper, we evaluate the availability of multi-tenant SFC infrastructures, where every network function is modeled as a multi-state system and is shared among different and independent tenants. To this aim, we propose a Universal Generating Function (UGF) approach, suitably extended to handle performance vectors, that we call Multidimensional UGF. This novel methodology is validated in a realistic multi-tenant telecommunication network scenario, where the service chain is composed by the network elements of an IP Multimedia Subsystem implemented via NFV. A steady-state availability evaluation of such an exemplary system is presented and a redundancy optimization problem is solved, so providing the SFC infrastructure which minimizes deployment cost while respecting a given availability requirement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567984/","volume":"14","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8567984/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept.-Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Availability Evaluation of Multi-Tenant Service Function Chaining Infrastructures by Multidimensional Universal Generating Function","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Availability Evaluation of Multi-Tenant Service Function Chaining Infrastructures by Multidimensional Universal Generating Function","sourcePdf":"tsc-postiglione-2885748-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155708S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"9562132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"9562132","articleId":"8567984","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8567992,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey Prinzie","affiliation":["ESAT\u2013ADVISE, KU Leuven, Geel, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Prinzie","orcid":"0000-0002-7303-985X","id":"37085456750"},{"name":"Sam Thys","affiliation":["ESAT\u2013ADVISE, KU Leuven, Geel, Belgium"],"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Thys","id":"37086595400"},{"name":"Bjorn Van Bockel","affiliation":["ESAT\u2013ADVISE, KU Leuven, Geel, Belgium"],"firstName":"Bjorn","lastName":"Van Bockel","id":"37086597292"},{"name":"Jialei Wang","affiliation":["ESAT\u2013ADVISE, KU Leuven, Geel, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jialei","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-6156-0333","id":"37086596638"},{"name":"Valentijn De Smedt","affiliation":["ESAT\u2013ADVISE, KU Leuven, Geel, Belgium"],"firstName":"Valentijn","lastName":"De Smedt","orcid":"0000-0002-6385-253X","id":"37543226000"},{"name":"Paul Leroux","affiliation":["ESAT\u2013ADVISE, KU Leuven, Geel, Belgium"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Leroux","orcid":"0000-0002-1790-2428","id":"37268721200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"8567992","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor device measurement","Voltage measurement","SRAM cells","Monitoring","Sensitivity","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit measurement","integrated circuit testing","radiation hardening (electronics)","radiation monitoring","SRAM chips","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM-based radiation monitor","dynamic voltage control","radiation monitoring","SRAM core","mixed radiation field","memory cells","CMOS technology","static random access memory application-specified integrated circuit","single-event upsets","multibit upsets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","heavy ion","memory","radiation sensors","single-event upsets (SEUs)","static random access memory (SRAM)","two-photon laser (TPA)"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel radiation monitor that is based on a custom static random access memory (SRAM) application-specified integrated circuit.

The introduced concept is based on expelling the currents flowing between the closely spaced antennas through a tapered slot etched on the array ground plane. The method is free from extra-reactive components and transmission lines. Although they are closely spaced and strongly coupled, the technique allows a high improvement in port isolation. A practical implementation of this mechanism is applied to a monopole array of two elements working at 2.45 GHz and closely packed (0.069\u03bb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n). The obtained results are very attractive, and a decoupling of about 40 dB is achieved with good impedance matching. Moreover, radiation diversity is obtained with a gain of 1.9 dBi. Furthermore, the decoupled array is integrated in a real receiving system, and the proposed decoupling technique is checked through the array signal processing. Hence, the obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed decoupling mechanism. In addition to its efficient port isolation, the most attractive features of the proposed decoupling technique are simplicity and ease of implementation in compact multiantenna devices.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8824008/08567995.pdf","startPage":"5892","endPage":"5899","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions

using mobile nanosensors (MNSs) for early stage anomaly detection. For concreteness, we focus on the detection of cancer cells located in a particular region of a blood vessel. These cancer cells produce and emit special molecules, so-called biomarkers, which are symptomatic for the presence of anomaly, into the cardiovascular system. Detection of cancer biomarkers with conventional blood tests is difficult in the early stages of a cancer due to the very low concentration of the biomarkers in the samples taken. However, close to the cancer cells, the concentration of the cancer biomarkers is high. Hence, detection is possible if a sensor with the ability to detect these biomarkers is placed in the vicinity of the cancer cells. Therefore, in this paper, we study the use of MNSs that are injected at a suitable injection site and can move through the blood vessels of the cardiovascular system, which potentially contain cancer cells. These MNSs can be activated by the biomarkers close to the cancer cells, where the biomarker concentration is sufficiently high. Eventually, the MNSs are collected by a fusion center (FC), where their activation levels are read and exploited to declare the presence of anomaly. We analytically derive the biomarker concentration in a network of interconnected blood vessels as well as the probability mass function of the MNSs' activation levels and validate the obtained results via particle-based simulations. Then, we derive the optimal decision rule for the FC regarding the presence of anomaly assuming that the entire network is known at the FC. Finally, for the FC, we propose a simple sum detector that does not require knowledge of the network topology. Our simulations reveal that while the optimal detector achieves a higher performance than the sum detector, both proposed detectors significantly outperform a benchmark scheme that uses fixed nanosensors at the FC.","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2018.2885463","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728/8698256/08567997.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2018.2885463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8698256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Early Cancer Detection in Blood Vessels Using Mobile Nanosensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8567997/","displayDocTitle":"Early Cancer Detection in Blood Vessels Using Mobile Nanosensors","volume":"18","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18620280","pubMedId":"30530333","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8567997/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Emerging Fields Initiative (EFI) of the Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU) and the STAEDTLER-Stiftung and the STAEDTLER-Stiftung"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003968","fundingName":"Iran National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Early Cancer Detection in Blood Vessels Using Mobile Nanosensors","sourcePdf":"tnb-mosayebi-2885463-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12679S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"8698256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8698256","articleId":"8567997","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8568000,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Chen","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8640274/8568000/chen-2885596-small.gif","p":["Peng Chen (S\u201917) received the B.S. degree in information countermeasure technology from Honors College, Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU), Xi'an, China, in 2013.

However, when the model mismatch is severe, these beamformers may not be robust to suppress wideband interferences effectively. Instead of adding more uncertainty constraints to enhance the robustness, we attempt to remove the desired signal component from the stacked sample covariance matrix by reconstructing a wideband stacked interference-plus-noise covariance matrix (SINCM). To overcome the model mismatch for an array without calibration, we introduce a possible mismatched stacked steering vector (SSV) set, and we reconstruct the SINCM by integrating all the possible mismatched SSVs over the interference angular sector and all subbands. Then we correct the desired signal SSV using two different approaches, one is solving an optimization problem that maximizes the array output, another is the eigen-decomposition of the reconstructed stacked desired signal covariance matrix. By transforming the RV inequality constraint into a weighted part of objective function, the finite impulse response coefficient vector of the proposed wideband beamformer can be calculated in a closed form as a function of the reconstructed SINCM and the estimated SSV of the signal-of-interest. Numerical simulations show robust performance in the case of unknown SSV mismatch. An acoustic experiment is carried out on a linear hydrophone array, and the result validates that the proposed beamformer provides better performance compared with other wideband adaptive beamformers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568000/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"68","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2019","accessionNumber":"18467789","htmlLink":"/document/8568000/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Covariance Matrix Reconstruction Algorithm for Time-Domain Wideband Adaptive Beamforming","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11527809 and 11604259"},{"fundingName":"Defense Industrial Technology Development","grantNumber":"JCKY2016607C009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Covariance Matrix Reconstruction Algorithm for Time-Domain Wideband Adaptive Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2885596-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087361S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8640274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8640274","articleId":"8568000","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8568007,"authors":[{"name":"Soubhagya Sutar","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687315/8630102/8568007/sutar-2885758-small.gif","p":["Soubhagya Sutar (S'15) received the BTech degree in electronics and instrumentation engineering from the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Rourkela, India, in 2011.

An additional challenge is the growing number of counterfeit components in these devices, with serious reliability and financial repercussions. Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are a promising security primitive to help address these concerns. Memory-based PUFs are particularly attractive as they can be realized with minimal or no additional hardware beyond what is already present in all embedded systems, i.e., memory. However, current memory-based PUFs utilize only a single memory technology for constructing the PUF, which has many disadvantages including making them vulnerable to certain security attacks. Several of these PUFs also suffer from other shortcomings such as low entropy, limited number of challenge-response pairs, etc. In this paper, we propose the design of a new memory-based combination PUF that tightly integrates (two) heterogeneous memory technologies to address these challenges/shortcomings. Our design enables us to authenticate an on-chip component and an off-chip component, thereby taking a step towards multi-component authentication in a device, without incorporating any additional hardware. We have implemented a prototype of the proposed combination PUF using a Terasic TR4-230 FPGA development board and several off-the-shelf SRAMs and DRAMs. Measured experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over current memory-based PUFs including the ability to resist various security attacks. We also propose a lightweight authentication scheme that ensures robust operation of the PUF across environmental and temporal variations. Extensive authentication tests performed on several PUF prototypes achieved a true-positive rate of greater than 97.5 percent across these variations. The absence of any false-positives, even under an invasive attack, further highlighted the effectiveness of the overall design.","doi":"10.1109/TMSCS.2018.2885758","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687315/8630102/08568007.pdf","startPage":"793","endPage":"810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8630102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMSCS.2018.2885758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory-Based Combination PUFs for Device Authentication in Embedded Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568007","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6687315/8630102/8568007-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"Memory-Based Combination PUFs for Device Authentication in Embedded Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568007/","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8568007/","volume":"4","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1527829"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Memory-Based Combination PUFs for Device Authentication in Embedded Systems","sourcePdf":"tmscs-sutar-2885758-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167122S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"8630102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8630102","articleId":"8568007","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8568046,"authors":[{"name":"Jaakko Haarla","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Jaakko","lastName":"Haarla"},{"name":"Anu Lehtovuori","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Anu","lastName":"Lehtovuori"},{"name":"Ville Viikari","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Ville","lastName":"Viikari"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-816-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-815-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8568046","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Base station","beamforming","calibration network","mobile communications","sub-6 GHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568046","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568046.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.0368","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.0368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Base station antenna array with calibration structure","abstract":"The introduction of 5G technologies is pushing research in mobile communications to millimeter waves.

Beside the numerous technological challenges faced by the equipment manufacturers, the definition of practical deployment requirements and elaboration of efficient network design procedures are key issues for future network providers and the refinement of business models. The work reported in the present paper is part of research activity on small-cell and wireless backhaul design methodologies. The authors analyze how digital geographical data and radio propagation models may be enhanced and tailored to answer new mmWave simulation requirements. Three different propagation methods are compared in an urban 60 GHz scenario: based on free building database, traditional high-resolution map data, or Lidar point cloud. The advantage of the multi-paths prediction versus direct-path is also investigated, using the Lidar point cloud as a simulation input.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.0383","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.0383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increased reliability of outdoor millimeter-wave link simulations by leveraging lidar point cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"Increased reliability of outdoor millimeter-wave link simulations by leveraging lidar point cloud","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568061/","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increased reliability of outdoor millimeter-wave link simulations by leveraging lidar point cloud","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20180383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030901S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"5","articleId":"8568061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8568087,"authors":[{"name":"Said Mikki","affiliation":["Department of ECECS, University of New Haven, West Haven, Connecticut, United States"],"firstName":"Said","lastName":"Mikki"},{"name":"Jocelyn Aulin","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Sweden, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jocelyn","lastName":"Aulin"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-816-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-815-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8568087","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-correlation","MIMO arrays","the ACGF method"]}],"abstract":"We develop a general stochastic electromagnetic theory of port antenna-antenna cross-correlation suitable for the analysis and design of MIMO systems.

As a result of successful excitation of chassis modes, the proposed cellular antennas can cover the desired cellular bands between 699\u2013862 MHz and 1710\u20132155 MHz with corresponding wideband matching circuits. Meanwhile, the proposed GPS antenna operates with a good right hand circular polarization (RHCP) performance (at least 5 dB higher gain than left hand circular polarization (LHCP)). Reasonable isolation performances among three antennas are also gained due to utilization of orthogonal modes. The results also show that with the proximity of human body (wrist phantom), over the wideband operation bands all antennas can achieve good efficiency. The averaged levels of \u221210 dB, \u22126 dB, and \u22124 dB, respectively for LTE low band, mid band and GPS band are achieved, indicating its potential in future wearable cellular IoT applications.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.0430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.0430","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568108.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiple antenna system design for wearable device using theory of characteristic mode","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"A multiple antenna system design for wearable device using theory of characteristic mode","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568108/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiple antenna system design for wearable device using theory of characteristic mode","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20180430.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054355S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8568108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8568109,"authors":[{"name":"Sana Salous","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, Durham University, Durham, UK"],"firstName":"Sana","lastName":"Salous"},{"name":"Hugo Parrott","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, Durham University, Durham, UK"],"firstName":"Hugo","lastName":"Parrott"},{"name":"Costas Constantinou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic, Electrical and Systems Engineering, Birmingham University, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Costas","lastName":"Constantinou"},{"name":"Yuri Nechayev","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.

The band offers large theoretical data rates with reasonable path loss to theoretically allow even up to kilometer long link distances when sufficiently high gain antennas are used. The molecular absorption loss in the band requires a large number of parameters from spectroscopic databases, and, thus, the exact modeling of its propagation characteristics is demanding. In this paper, we provide a simple, yet accurate absorption model, which can be utilized to predict the absorption loss at the above frequency band. The model is valid at a regular atmospheric pressure, it depends on the distance, the relative humidity, and the frequency. The existing simplified model by ITU does not cover frequencies above 350 GHz and has more complexity than our proposed model. The molecular absorption loss increases exponentially with the distance, decreasing the utilizable bandwidth in the vicinity of the absorption lines. We provide a model to approximate the window widths at the above frequency band. This model depends on the distance, the relative humidity, the frequency, and the maximum tolerable loss. It is shown to be very accurate below one kilometer link distances.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.0446","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568124.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.0446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified molecular absorption loss model for 275\u2013400 gigahertz frequency band","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"Simplified molecular absorption loss model for 275\u2013400 gigahertz frequency band","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568124/","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified molecular absorption loss model for 275\u2013400 gigahertz frequency band","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20180446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030613S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"14","articleId":"8568124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8568128,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Ndip","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration, IZM, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355 Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Ndip"},{"name":"Martin Schneider-Ramelow","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration, IZM, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355 Berlin, Germany; Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Stra\u00dfe des 17.

The measured result shows that the antennas are having return loss less than \u221210 dB in the range from 3 to 10.6 GHz excluding the notched bands. However, isolation is less than \u221220 dB in most of the band without using any decoupling network.

In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the neural network for high-accuracy multi-parameter modeling, the electrical parameters of the antenna such as return loss and maximum gain have been predicted using some physical parameters such as widths and lengths of the slots or sleeves. The advantage conferred by the proposed method is that fast and intelligent modeling method is available at multi-parameter structures in contrast with conventional blind parametric sweep simulation, and so a lower memory and higher accuracy of the behavioral model is achieved. It can also be advantageous when the user is looking for system level, as the increased components amounts can help as a surrogate model.

The system uses frequency modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) transmission based on multiple input multiple output (MIMO) substrate-integrate waveguide (SIW) antennas operating in the K-band regime. The continuous sawtooth time-domain wave transmitted from two SIW antennas, by time-domain multiple access (TDMA), is detected with a half-lambda spaced four-element SIW receiver array at a distance of 4 meters in a calibrated anechoic chamber and verified with simulations. The high bandwidth and omnidirectionality of the SIW antennas in the horizontal plane, together with digital-beamforming for the achieved MIMO virtual array, offers an overall field-of-view of 130 degrees for the radar system. Also, the MIMO radar achieves an angular resolution of 14 degrees and offers a range resolution of 10 cm at a cost of only 6 transmitter and receiver elements in total.","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568210.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.0532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.0532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimetre-wave FMCW MIMO radar system development using broadband SIW antennas","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","SIW antenna","FMCW radar","SRR","TDMA","Digital Beamforming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Millimetre-wave FMCW MIMO radar system development using broadband SIW antennas","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimetre-wave FMCW MIMO radar system development using broadband SIW antennas","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20180532.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027425S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"5","articleId":"8568210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8568228,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This strategy leads to important savings in the number of measurement points as shown in various experimental examples.","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568315.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.0637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.0637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing approach for fast antenna far field characterization","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna measurements","compact antenna test range","compressive sensing","antenna pattern","spherical harmonics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing approach for fast antenna far field characterization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing approach for fast antenna far field characterization","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20180637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026721S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8568315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8568355,"authors":[{"name":"Senglee Foo","affiliation":["Huawei Canada Technologies, R&D Center, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Senglee","lastName":"Foo"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-816-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-815-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8568355","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568355","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Liquid crystal","reconfigurable","phased array","metamaterial","lens","millimeter-wave","low-profile"]}],"abstract":"This article describes a novel concept of low-profile, lens-enhanced, reconfigurable millimeter-wave phased array. The proposed phased array comprised of multiple reconfigurable lens-enhanced radiators, which increases the effective aperture of each radiator and significantly reduces overall complexity and overall height of phased array. By using electrostatic controllable liquid-crystal-loaded metamaterial lens, transmission phase of each subarray of unit cells across the aperture can be electronically tuned independently. The array can be fed in groups to allow flexible hybrid beam forming for multiple beams, or can be fed with coherent phase across the aperture to form a highly directive steerable beam. Use of multiple feeds with smaller sub-arrays of unit cells also significantly reduces overall array profile since focal distance from the lens is reduced proportionally with smaller lenses. The proposed architecture allows forming of a versatile, low profile, beam scanning phased array with comparably high aperture efficiency for the future 5G deployment and satellite communications applications.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.0677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.0677","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568355.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Liquid-crystal reconfigurable, lens-enhanced, millimeter-wave phased array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568355/","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Liquid-crystal reconfigurable, lens-enhanced, millimeter-wave phased array","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Liquid-crystal reconfigurable, lens-enhanced, millimeter-wave phased array","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20180677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029364S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","articleId":"8568355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8568380,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang-Cheng Hao","affiliation":["The State Key Lab of Millimeter-waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang-Cheng","lastName":"Hao"},{"name":"Wei Hong","affiliation":["The State Key Lab of Millimeter-waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hong"},{"name":"Ji-Xin Chen","affiliation":["The State Key Lab of Millimeter-waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ji-Xin","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"JianFeng Zhai","affiliation":["The State Key Lab of Millimeter-waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"JianFeng","lastName":"Zhai"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-816-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-815-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8568380","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568380","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Terahertz antenna","Beam-scanning antenna","wide scanning angle","Reflectors"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates a high gain THz beam scanning antenna with a wide scanning range.

However, one major challenge is the angle of arrival (AoA) estimation because the extremely high path loss requires adaptive high gain directive antennas (e.g. via beamforming). Although, this topic has been comprehensively studied, there is so far no adequate method subject to simple hardware design and computational effort as well as THz channel characteristics. This paper presents an AoA estimation algorithm in two steps based on the correlation of power angular spectra (PAS) in different frequencies. A low frequency radio frequency (RF) frontend is applied for a rough and fast AoA estimation in the first step and the THz RF frontend estimates the precise AoA within the angular range confined in the first step to reduce the time consumption of AoA estimation. The correlation of PAS in different frequencies is the premise of the algorithm and is validated with a broadband channel sounder in a typical application scenario of indoor THz communication. Finally, the algorithm efficiency is analyzed with two exemplar scanning resolutions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568437/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Two-step angle-of-arrival estimation for terahertz communications based on correlation of power-angular spectra in frequency","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-step angle-of-arrival estimation for terahertz communications based on correlation of power-angular spectra in frequency","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20180759.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026759S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"7","articleId":"8568437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8568440,"authors":[{"name":"Hubregt J.

The RF-to-DC Power Conversion Efficiency of the receiver's rectifier therefore is of paramount importance. This efficiency can be increased by applying a multi-sine excitation at the transmitter. Here, we propose to use a pulse-delayed array excitation as a special form of multi-sine excitation. As reported earlier, this excitation will lead to the creation of a focal area with high energy density at the location of the receiver. In this paper, we discuss practical considerations for increasing the peak- and average-power level in the focal area. We find that, relative to an array excited with non-delayed pulses, we may expect at the focal position a peak-power gain up to the number of array elements squared and an average-power gain between zero and the number of array elements.

In recent work, it has been shown that such structures can implement perfect anomalous deflection and beam splitting in reflect-mode, using only a handful of subwavelength meta-atoms per (wavelength-scale) macro-period. Extending previous formulations to enable manipulation of transmitted fields as well, we derive analytical relations between the scattered fields, currents induced on the wires, and the individual load impedances, and enforce conditions that guarantee elimination of spurious scattering while retaining a passive and lossless structure. Utilizing our recent results, we demonstrate how the multilayered metagratings can be realized using realistic printed-capacitor loads, whose geometry can be analytically resolved. Thus, this design scheme, which can be fully implemented in MATLAB, prescribes simple physical structures, achieving optimal anomalous refraction efficiency without requiring even a single full-wave simulation. This paves the path for harnessing this novel concept for applications requiring control on transmitted diffraction modes (e.g., lenses), taking advantage of an efficient and rigorous design scheme, and simplified structure.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.0838","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568516.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.0838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perfect anomalous refraction with metagratings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568516/","displayDocTitle":"Perfect anomalous refraction with metagratings","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perfect anomalous refraction with metagratings","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20180838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028123S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8568516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8568521,"authors":[{"name":"Saad Alharbi","affiliation":["Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, US"],"firstName":"Saad","lastName":"Alharbi"},{"name":"Raed M.

These new types of devices present new test challenges not present with today's sub-6 GHz UE devices. In particular, test methods currently agreed to by 3GPP assume no knowledge of the locations of the multiple antennas or even which antenna is active at a given time. Consequently, any far-field measurement must employ a quiet zone sufficiently large to encompass the entire device. For a typical 5G UE operating at 28 GHz and 15 cm along the longest diagonal dimension, the minimum far-field separation between the probe antenna and device is 4.2 m. In this paper, we will discuss and experimentally demonstrate the types of measurement errors anticipated for a multi-antenna UE device characterized with a far-field distance sufficient to test an individual antenna but insufficient to test antennas across the larger UE device. We also show experimental results obtained from a compact antenna test range (CATR) and confirm that it provides accurate measurements in a relatively smaller footprint than a traditional far-field measurement.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.0857","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568535.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.0857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization challenges for millimeter-wave multi-antenna 5G devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Characterization challenges for millimeter-wave multi-antenna 5G devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568535/","publicationDate":"April 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization challenges for millimeter-wave multi-antenna 5G devices","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20180857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030868S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8568535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-05"},{"_id":8568536,"authors":[{"name":"Pekka Ky\u00f6sti","affiliation":["Keysight Technologies Finland oy, Oulu, Finland; University of Oulu, CWC, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Pekka","lastName":"Ky\u00f6sti"},{"name":"Lassi Hentil\u00e4","affiliation":["Keysight Technologies Finland oy, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Lassi","lastName":"Hentil\u00e4"},{"name":"Jukka Kyr\u00f6l\u00e4inen","affiliation":["Keysight Technologies Finland oy, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jukka","lastName":"Kyr\u00f6l\u00e4inen"},{"name":"Fengchun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Fengchun","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Wei Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Fan"},{"name":"Matti Latva-aho","affiliation":["University of Oulu, CWC, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Latva-aho"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-816-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-815-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8568536","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","performance evaluation","over the air testing","multi-probe anechoic chamber setup","mm-wave"]}],"abstract":"This paper discusses a multi-probe anechoic chamber setup, capable of reconstructing non-stationary radio propagation environments for testing of millimetre wave and massive Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output devices.

Our results reveal that there is high spatial-temporal correlation between 28 and 140 GHz channels, similar numbers of strong multipath components, and only small variations in the large-scale parameters between the two bands.

Statistics indicate an increase in incident rate, especially in Europe, North America, and Oceania. Currently, the set of diagnostic tools for breast cancer detection is wide. Nevertheless, these tools exhibit limitations, especially when aiming at cost-effective periodical mass screenings. Therefore, there is a growing interest toward microwave imaging systems for biomedical applications, and several microwave prototypes have been proposed worldwide. However, in order to have a satisfying resolution for early-diagnosis, microwaves may be not sufficient, and a crucial point is the utilization of higher frequencies. To this aim, as the physical principle of all imaging techniques at these frequencies is based on the detection of the dielectric discontinuities between materials, the characterization of all breast tissues in the mm-wave spectrum becomes fundamental. No experimental data were available beyond 20 GHz before the two extensive experimental campaigns performed at the European Institute of Oncology in 2014 and 2016. In this paper, the results concerning the full database (given by the fusion of the two datasets) of ex-vivo samples, are presented. In particular, a huge amount of data is considered, involving more than 330 samples, of which 237 healthy and 99 malignant, taken from around 100 women with an age spanning from 28 years up to 85 years.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568609/","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dielectric properties of breast tissues: Experimental results up to 50 GHz","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dielectric properties of breast tissues: Experimental results up to 50 GHz","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20180931.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026403S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"7","articleId":"8568609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8568614,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Foglia Manzillo","affiliation":["Commissariat a l'energie atomique et aux energies alternatives Siege administratif, Gif-sur-Yvette, \u00c3\u017dle-de-France, FR"],"firstName":"Francesco Foglia","lastName":"Manzillo"},{"name":"Maciej \u015amierzchalski","affiliation":["Commissariat a l'energie atomique et aux energies alternatives Siege administratif, Gif-sur-Yvette, \u00c3\u017dle-de-France, FR"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"\u015amierzchalski"},{"name":"Mauro Ettorre","affiliation":["Universite de Rennes 1, Rennes, Bretagne, FR"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Ettorre"},{"name":"Jouko Aurinsalo","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd., Finland"],"firstName":"Jouko","lastName":"Aurinsalo"},{"name":"Kari T.

The realization of substrate-integrated CTS arrays is enabled by the unique three-dimensional (3-D) integration capabilities of the LTCC process. The antenna architecture includes two separate CTS arrays, activated one at a time by a co-integrated switch-network. With this choice, the overall system simultaneously achieves low side lobe levels (SLLs) and high overlap of the radiated beams, within an angular sector of \u00b138\u00b0 in the scan plane.

First, a wideband monopolar patch and a L-probe fed patch were organically integrated together to achieve a wideband (2.25 to 2.85 GHz) broadside and conical-beam pattern reconfigurable system that radiates LP radiation. Radiation coverage and wireless channel capacity were improved significantly making the reported LP antenna a good candidate as a ceiling mounted antenna for indoor wireless communications. On the other hand, a circularly-polarized (CP) broadside and conical-beam reconfigurable antenna would be preferred for satellite communications. To realize it, we successfully excited both the TM11 and TM21 modes on a circular patch with an annular slot antenna. A reconfigurable feeding network was designed to provide the correct excitations for these two modes. CP switchable broadside and conical radiated beams were realized within the same overlapping frequency ranges from 2.45 to 2.65 GHz. Both the LP and CP antennas were fabricated and tested. Experimental results show good agreement with their simulated performance characteristics. Very good radiation performance was obtained.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.0943","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568621.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.0943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern reconfigurable techniques for LP and CP antennas with the broadside and conical beams","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568621","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Pattern reconfigurable techniques for LP and CP antennas with the broadside and conical beams","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568621/","publicationDate":"April 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18122946","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern reconfigurable techniques for LP and CP antennas with the broadside and conical beams","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20180943.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042219S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","articleId":"8568621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8568625,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00e9sar Calvo-Ram\u00edrez","affiliation":["ETSI Sistemas de Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Technical University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"C\u00e9sar","lastName":"Calvo-Ram\u00edrez"},{"name":"Ana Gonzalez-Plaza","affiliation":["ETSI Sistemas de Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Technical University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Gonzalez-Plaza"},{"name":"C\u00e9sar Briso","affiliation":["ETSI Sistemas de Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Technical University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"C\u00e9sar","lastName":"Briso"},{"name":"Antonio P\u00e9rez-Yuste","affiliation":["ETSI Sistemas de Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Technical University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"P\u00e9rez-Yuste"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-816-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-815-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8568625","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft communication","autonomous aerial vehicles","delays","indoor radio","microwave propagation","multipath channels","radiowave propagation","remotely operated vehicles","UHF radio propagation","ultra wideband communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power delay profile measurements","narrow pulse technique","channel sounder","payload information","high capacity","communications links","air-ground propagation channel models","disaster assistance","transportation","commercial applications","UAV","unmanned aerial vehicles","low altitude UAVs","wide band propagation measurements","higher altitudes","multipath propagation","L-band","average delay profile"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel sounding","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","measurement","Delay Spread","Power Delay Profile"]}],"abstract":"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are expected to be used extensively in the near future in commercial applications such as aerial surveillance, transportation and disaster assistance, among other applications.

The results show that multipath propagation decreases at higher altitudes.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.0947","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568625.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.0947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide band propagation measurements and modelling for low altitude UAVs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Wide band propagation measurements and modelling for low altitude UAVs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568625/","publicationDate":"April 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18122950","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide band propagation measurements and modelling for low altitude UAVs","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20180947.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036664S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","articleId":"8568625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8568636,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanna Calo","affiliation":["Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Puglia, IT"],"firstName":"Giovanna","lastName":"Calo"},{"name":"Gaetano Bellanca","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Ferrara, Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna, IT"],"firstName":"Gaetano","lastName":"Bellanca"},{"name":"Ali Emre Kaplan","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Ferrara, Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna, IT"],"firstName":"Ali Emre","lastName":"Kaplan"},{"name":"Franco Fuschini","affiliation":["Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare Sezione di Trieste, Trieste, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, IT"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Fuschini"},{"name":"Marina Barbiroli","affiliation":["Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare Sezione di Trieste, Trieste, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, IT"],"firstName":"Marina","lastName":"Barbiroli"},{"name":"Michele Bozzetti","affiliation":["Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Puglia, IT"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Bozzetti"},{"name":"Paolo Bassi","affiliation":["Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare Sezione di Trieste, Trieste, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, IT"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Bassi"},{"name":"Vincenzo Petruzzelli","affiliation":["Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Puglia, IT"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Petruzzelli"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-816-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-815-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8568636","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","free-space optical communication","integrated optics","integrated optoelectronics","nanophotonics","optical switches","optical waveguides","plasmonics","silicon","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["plasmonic nanoantennas","distant cores","chip multiprocessors","wireless connections","crosstalk","optical frequencies","network design","Vivaldi plasmonic antennas","on-chip wireless optical communications","complex switching fabrics","current on-chip communication","network management","silicon waveguides","on-chip wireless propagation characteristics","point-to-point link performances","multilayered medium","homogeneous medium","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical antennas","Nano antennas","Nanophotonics","Surface plasmons","Wireless optical communications","Optical networks on chip"]}],"abstract":"On-chip wireless optical communications among distant cores in chip multiprocessors can lead to a completely new approach to overcome the limits of current on-chip communication. In fact, using wireless connections mitigates the problems related to the design and the fabrication of hugely complex switching fabrics, where long paths suffer of crosstalk and loss issues. Implementing wireless communication at optical frequencies allows simplifications in network design and management. In this paper, a solution based on Vivaldi plasmonic antennas integrated with silicon waveguides is presented. Moreover, on-chip wireless propagation characteristics and point-to-point link performances in homogeneous and multilayered medium are investigated and discussed.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.0958","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568636.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.0958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-chip wireless optical communication through plasmonic nanoantennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"On-chip wireless optical communication through plasmonic nanoantennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568636/","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"18122961","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-chip wireless optical communication through plasmonic nanoantennas","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20180958.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024931S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8568636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8568644,"authors":[{"name":"Xue Lin","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Lin"},{"name":"Bo Ai","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Ai"},{"name":"Danping He","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Danping","lastName":"He"},{"name":"Ke Guan","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Guan"},{"name":"Chen Zhao","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Zhao"},{"name":"Zhangdui Zhong","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Zhangdui","lastName":"Zhong"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-816-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-815-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8568644","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","millimetre wave communication","MIMO communication","railway communication","ray tracing","stochastic processes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system","multiple-input multiple-output system","azimuth spread of departure","azimuth spread of arrival","standard deviations","receiver movement","millimeter-wave band","ray azimuth-elevation angle","HSR scenario layout","stochastic channel modeling","multipath components","birth-death process","HSR communication environments","millimeter-wave radio communication channel","high-speed railway scenario modules","angular spread characteristics","mmWave band","wireless channel measurement data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["angular spread","channel simulation","high-speed railway","millimeter wave","ray tracing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, three typical high-speed railway (HSR) scenario modules are selected to study the characteristics of millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio communication channel.

In addition, the standard deviations of azimuth spread of arrival (ASA) and azimuth spread of departure (ASD) are calculated, which can be employed to determine the ray azimuth/elevation angle of arrival (AoA/EoA) in stochastic channel modeling.

The array antenna uses hexagonal lattice and the antenna elements, each of which is integrated with a GaN power amplifier (PA), are activated in septets for spatial power combination. The GaN technology relies on 4-inch GaN-on-SiC wafers using slanted gate structures with Iridium-based gate metallization. A prototype of the AFR is fabricated as the demonstrator. The reflector has a diameter of 300mm and the feed array consists of 16 antenna elements. The feed array has impedance bandwidth from 17.5-20 GHz with high isolation between antenna elements. Good beam switching performance is obtained with small gain variation. The achieved figures of merit for the PA component attain an output power saturated level of roughly 5W providing a gain close to 16 dB over a broad frequency range from 18 to 20 GHz.

The campaigns cover indoor, outdoor, and outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) scenarios and a wide frequency range from 2 to 86 GHz. Several requirements have been identified that define the parameters which need to be aligned in order to make a reasonable comparison among the different channel sounders employed for this study. A new modelling approach enabling the evaluation of the statistical significance of the model parameters from different measurements and the establishment of a unified model is proposed. After careful analysis, the conclusion is that any frequency trend of the DS is small considering its confidence intervals. There is statistically significant difference from the 3GPP New Radio (NR) model TR 38.901, except for the O2I scenario.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.0993","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568671.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.0993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the frequency dependency of radio channel's delay spread: Analyses and findings from mmMAGIC multi-frequency channel sounding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568671/","displayDocTitle":"On the frequency dependency of radio channel's delay spread: Analyses and findings from mmMAGIC multi-frequency channel sounding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"18122996","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the frequency dependency of radio channel's delay spread: Analyses and findings from mmMAGIC multi-frequency channel sounding","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20180993.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054579S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"7","articleId":"8568671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8568673,"authors":[{"name":"Kien Pham","affiliation":["Institut d'Electronique et de Telecommunications de Rennes, Rennes, Bretagne, FR"],"firstName":"Kien","lastName":"Pham"},{"name":"Ronan Sauleau","affiliation":["Institut d'Electronique et de Telecommunications de Rennes, Rennes, Bretagne, FR"],"firstName":"Ronan","lastName":"Sauleau"},{"name":"Erwan Fourn","affiliation":["Institut d'Electronique et de Telecommunications de Rennes, Rennes, Bretagne, FR"],"firstName":"Erwan","lastName":"Fourn"},{"name":"Fatimata Diaby","affiliation":["CEA, LETI, MINATEC Campus, 38054 Grenoble, France; University of Grenoble-Alpes, 38000 Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Fatimata","lastName":"Diaby"},{"name":"Antonio Clemente","affiliation":["CEA, LETI, MINATEC Campus, 38054 Grenoble, France; University of Grenoble-Alpes, 38000 Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Clemente"},{"name":"Laurent Dussopt","affiliation":["CEA, LETI, MINATEC Campus, 38054 Grenoble, France; University of Grenoble-Alpes, 38000 Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Dussopt"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-816-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-815-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8568673","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568673","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","electromagnetic wave polarisation","microwave antenna arrays","multifrequency antennas","satellite communication","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarization twisted unit-cells","dual-band dual linearly polarized transmitarray unit-cell","single-band unit-cells","linear orthogonal polarizations","dual-band transmitarray","single-band subarrays","Ka-band transmitarray antennas","K-band transmitarray antennas","satellite communications","frequency 18.8 GHz to 21.0 GHz","frequency 27.5 GHz to 31.0 GHz","size 6.0 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transmitarray antenna","dual-band","Ka-band","discrete lens antenna"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a dual-band dual linearly polarized transmitarray unit-cell designed for satellite communications in K/Ka-band (down link: 18.8-21 GHz; uplink: 27.5-31 GHz).

Their frequency response shows a -10-dB impedance bandwidth of more than 9% around 29 GHz and 19.5 GHz, with a 180\u00b0 phase-shift in both bands. Those unit-cells are optimized with the same periodicity (6 mm, which is equivalent to 0.58-wavelength in free space at 29 GHz). The extremely low mutual coupling between these unit-cells allows designing a dual-band transmitarray by simply interleaving two single-band subarrays operating in the up- and down-links. Single- and dual-band transmitarray antennas are designed to validate the proposed concepts and demonstrate that they exhibit similar radiation performance in both bands, thereby proving the relevance of the proposed interleaving technique.

In this paper, the channel characteristics at 28 GHz in an indoor scenario are researched based on ray tracing (RT) simulation and measurement. In the RT simulation, various configurations, such as different number of reflections, diffractions and penetrations are used. As for the measurement, two setups are implemented in order to analyze more parameters. Setup one is that biconical antennas are used at both the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX). The other setup is that horn antenna at RX is rotated 360\u00b0 in azimuth with a step of 5\u00b0 when an omni-directional antenna located at TX. Meanwhile, antenna is rotated one circle with an elevation angle of 10\u00b0, 0\u00b0 and \u221210\u00b0, respectively. Path loss and K-factor are analyzed firstly, and analysis results indicate the RT result with 1 or 2 reflections, 1 diffractions and 5 penetrations in this conference room is closest to the measurement result and channel models in 3GPP TR 38.901. Then, the root mean square (RMS) delay spread and RMS angular spread are investigated, which shows the value of measurement is a bit larger than RT because of the limitation of azimuth and elevation step. According to all the results, 1\u20132 reflections, 1 diffraction and 5 penetrations can be used in RT for future analysis of indoor scenario at 28 GHz.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative channel study of ray tracing and measurement for an indoor scenario at 28 GHz","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.1044","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568722.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.1044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Comparative channel study of ray tracing and measurement for an indoor scenario at 28 GHz","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative channel study of ray tracing and measurement for an indoor scenario at 28 GHz","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20181044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080055S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8568722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8568723,"authors":[{"name":"T.G.

The evaluation of current (sub 6GHz) wireless user equipment (UE) is carried out using cabled connections to temporary antenna connectors which disconnect the antenna. More recently, SISO over the air (OTA) test methods have been developed to measure antenna efficiency. The most recent evolution is the addition of MIMO OTA tests which measure the impact of the antenna on MIMO transmissions. The 5G standard will utilise the large available bandwidth at centimetre and millimetre wave frequencies of up to 100GHz to provide gigabit data rates. At such high frequencies, 5G devices will require phased antenna arrays to compensate for the high losses with the use of beamforming techniques. These integrated arrays are unlikely to have temporary antenna connectors due to their small form-factors, and this represents a big challenge for non-intrusive testing of their performance. The consequence is that all testing at mmWave will need to be carried out OTA. This paper outlines a method to determine the 3D antenna array pattern of the 60 GHz antenna array integrated within an 802.11ad modem (Lightning-J manufactured by Blu Wireless Technology) with the use of packet measurements, without disassembling the device or bypassing the antenna. Co and cross polar relative array gain patterns were measured for a range of array scan angles, and show good agreement with the modem behaviour (15.7dBi maximum boresight directivity) including the cross-polarisation levels observed in outdoor testing using this modem (up to \u221210dB co/cross polar ratio).","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568723.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.1045","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.1045","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568723","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["millimetre wave","Over the Air (OTA) testing","5G"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568723/","displayDocTitle":"Non-intrusive characterization of 60GHz antenna array, using packet measurements","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-intrusive characterization of 60GHz antenna array, using packet measurements","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20181045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025646S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8568723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8568724,"authors":[{"name":"Corbett Rowell","affiliation":["OTA & Antenna Measurement Solutions, Rohde & Schwarz, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Corbett","lastName":"Rowell"},{"name":"Adam Tankielun","affiliation":["OTA & Antenna Measurement Solutions, Rohde & Schwarz, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Tankielun"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-816-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-815-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8568724","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["antenna","propagation","measurement","plane wave","5G","OTA"]}],"abstract":"Basestation antenna systems in 5G present two significant challenges for antenna measurement: up to 256 antennas and integrated transceiver with antenna, resulting in an elimination of traditional RF port interfaces and large DUTs (device under test). Several transceiver performance metrics are typically measured in far-field type conditions, including Error Vector Magnitude (EVM), Adjacent Channel Leakage Power (ACLR), and Spectral Emissions Mask (SEM). Due to the basestation size in the 5G sub 6GHz frequency bands, this requires a far-field chamber with 10 to 50 meters of range length. This paper proposes a method using a variant of a hardware based Fourier transform located in the near-field of the DUT antenna in order to create far-field conditions-a plane wave converter (PWC). A phased antenna array of 156 elements is placed within 1.5 meters of a high gain basestation antenna of dimensions 60\u00d760 cm. There is excellent agreement between the gain measurement results of the PWC with measurement results from a certified chamber. The measurement system is bidirectional and able to directly measure both traditional antenna metrics of gain as well as transceiver metrics of EVM, ACLR, SEM, and receiver sensitivity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Plane wave converter for 5G massive MIMO basestation measurements","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.1046","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568724.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.1046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568724/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Plane wave converter for 5G massive MIMO basestation measurements","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Plane wave converter for 5G massive MIMO basestation measurements","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20181046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023745S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"4","articleId":"8568724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8568729,"authors":[{"name":"Amyrul Azuan Mohd Bahar","affiliation":["Microwave Research Group, Centre for Telecommunication Research and Innovation (CeTRI), Faculty of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM), 76100 Durian Tunggal, Melaka, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Amyrul Azuan Mohd","lastName":"Bahar"},{"name":"Zahriladha Zakaria","affiliation":["Microwave Research Group, Centre for Telecommunication Research and Innovation (CeTRI), Faculty of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM), 76100 Durian Tunggal, Melaka, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zahriladha","lastName":"Zakaria"},{"name":"Azmi Awang Md Isa","affiliation":["Microwave Research Group, Centre for Telecommunication Research and Innovation (CeTRI), Faculty of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM), 76100 Durian Tunggal, Melaka, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Azmi Awang Md","lastName":"Isa"},{"name":"Yosza Dasril","affiliation":["Microwave Research Group, Centre for Telecommunication Research and Innovation (CeTRI), Faculty of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM), 76100 Durian Tunggal, Melaka, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Yosza","lastName":"Dasril"},{"name":"Rammah A.

It is observed that the proposed inter-connected bridge structure based on split ring resonator provides better sensitivity for dielectric measurement when compared with the standard microwave SRR sensors. The sensor operating at 1 to 6 GHz frequency range with 2.5\u03bcL sample volume at a time. The mathematical derivation is generated by loading sample with a standard reference of the materials in order to develop the empirical model for the determination of complex permittivity and the loss tangent. As demonstrated by the results, the unloaded Q-factor improves more than 400 over the narrow bandwidth at operating frequency of 2.3 GHz and provides less than 5 dB of the insertion loss. The measured data of each sample are in good agreement with the corresponding reference values available in the literature having a typical average detection error of less than 2.04%. By comparison, this design has an identical performance goal and provides excellent sensing capability which can be implemented in chemical and biosensor applications.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.1051","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568729.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.1051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dielectric properties measurement based on split ring resonator for microfluidic characterization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568729/","displayDocTitle":"Dielectric properties measurement based on split ring resonator for microfluidic characterization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dielectric properties measurement based on split ring resonator for microfluidic characterization","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20181051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03683S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8568729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8568737,"authors":[{"name":"Shanpu Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Shanpu","lastName":"Shen"},{"name":"Yujie Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yujie","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Chi-Yuk Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Chi-Yuk","lastName":"Chiu"},{"name":"Ross D.

Simulation results have been confirmed by the measurements of the prototype with a hand and head phantoms.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.1201","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568879.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.1201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of user effects on mobile phased antenna array from 5 to 6 GHz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of user effects on mobile phased antenna array from 5 to 6 GHz","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568879/","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of user effects on mobile phased antenna array from 5 to 6 GHz","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20181201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034529S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"5","articleId":"8568879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8568891,"authors":[{"name":"Surentiran Padmanathan","affiliation":["Advanced Communication Engineering (ACE) Center of Excellence, School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Perlis, 01000 Kangar, Perlis, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Surentiran","lastName":"Padmanathan"},{"name":"Azremi Abdullah Al-Hadi","affiliation":["Advanced Communication Engineering (ACE) Center of Excellence, School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Perlis, 01000 Kangar, Perlis, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Azremi Abdullah","lastName":"Al-Hadi"},{"name":"Ping Jack Soh","affiliation":["Advanced Communication Engineering (ACE) Center of Excellence, School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Perlis, 01000 Kangar, Perlis, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ping Jack","lastName":"Soh"},{"name":"Mohd Faizal Jamlos","affiliation":["Advanced Communication Engineering (ACE) Center of Excellence, School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Perlis, 01000 Kangar, Perlis, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Faizal","lastName":"Jamlos"},{"name":"Sharul Kamal Abdul Rahim","affiliation":["Wireless Communication Centre (WCC), Department of Communication Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Sharul Kamal Abdul","lastName":"Rahim"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-816-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-815-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8568891","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568891","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","mobile terminal","reconfigurable MIMO","PIFA","millimeter wave","radiation pattern"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a multiband pattern-reconfigurable Planar Inverted-F Antenna (PIFA) for Fifth Generation (5G) Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) mobile terminal is presented. A driven cross patch antenna surrounded by four PIFA elements are combined to form a Cross Patch Quadruple PIFA (CPQPIFA) to produce pattern reconfiguration. The direction of the radiation beam changes when the four metal shorting PIN diodes placed in between the driven cross patch antenna and the PIFA element are initiated separately. Activation of these four PIN diodes produces eight different beam directions at port 1 and port 2. The proposed CPQPIFA design is very versatile as it resonates at three frequency bands ranging from 22 GHz to 30 GHz while achieving reflection coefficient of less than \u2212 15dB. Besides that, a high isolation between two CPQPIFAs reduces the mutual coupling to result in an Envelope Correlation Coefficient (ECC) of less than 0.03. Along with its advantage in achieving stable pattern reconfiguration and low ECC, the proposed MIMO antenna is deemed suitable for future 5G mobile terminal application.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2018.1213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2018.1213","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","displayPublicationTitle":"12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526159/8526160/08568891.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiband pattern-reconfigurable PIFA for 5G MIMO mobile terminals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568891/","conferenceDate":"9-13 April 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Multiband pattern-reconfigurable PIFA for 5G MIMO mobile terminals","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiband pattern-reconfigurable PIFA for 5G MIMO mobile terminals","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"20181213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041222S","chronDate":"9-13 April 2018","isNumber":"8526160","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526159","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8568891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8568935,"authors":[{"name":"Bilal T Malik","affiliation":["School of Electronic & Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Bilal T","lastName":"Malik"},{"name":"Viktor Doychinov","affiliation":["School of Electronic & Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"Doychinov"},{"name":"Ian D Robertson","affiliation":["School of Electronic & Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Ian D","lastName":"Robertson"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-816-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-815-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8568935","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568935","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Phase shifter","SIW","millimeter wave","antenna arrays","antennas","5G"]}],"abstract":"This work presents a novel compact and broadband electronically controllable substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) phase shifter intended for beamsteering applications in antenna arrays for 5G wireless communication.

This could be partially achieved by providing three promising features, which are radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting, improper Gaussian signaling, and operating in full-duplex communication mode, i.e., transmit and receive at the same time within the same frequency band. In this paper, we consider these aspects jointly in a multi-antenna heterogeneous two-tier network. In this network, the users in the femtocell share the scarce resources with the cellular users in the macro-cell and have to cope with the interference from the macro-cell base station as well as the transmitter noise and residual self-interference due to imperfect full-duplex operation. Interestingly enough, while these impairments are detrimental from the achievable rate perspective, they are beneficial from the energy harvesting aspect, as they carry RF energy. In this paper, we consider this natural tradeoff jointly and propose appropriate optimization problems for beamforming and optimal resource allocation. Moreover, various receiver structures are employed for both information detection and energy harvesting (EH) capabilities. This paper aims at characterizing the tradeoff between the achievable rates and harvested energies. Rate and energy maximization problems are thoroughly investigated. Interestingly, with sufficiently high EH demands, we observe the convergence of the rate region obtained by non-linear precoding to the rate region achieved by widely linear precoding at the base station.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Device-to-device communication","Transmitters","Interference cancellation","Energy harvesting","Base stations","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","energy harvesting","femtocellular radio","interference suppression","optimisation","precoding","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous multitier networks","improper signaling","joint rate-energy optimization","wireless nodes","future communication systems","higher data rates","long-lasting energy supplies","interference-limited heterogeneous networks","radio frequency energy harvesting","full-duplex communication mode","frequency band","two-tier network","femtocell share","scarce resources","cellular users","macro-cell base station","residual self-interference","full-duplex operation","achievable rate perspective","RF energy","beamforming resource allocation","optimal resource allocation","receiver structures","information detection","achievable rates","harvested energies","energy maximization problems","Gaussian signaling","energy harvesting","optimization problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous networks","improper Gaussian signaling","rate-energy optimization","energy harvesting","full-duplex communication"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TWC.2018.2884456","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8605558/08568990.pdf","startPage":"680","endPage":"694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8605558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2018.2884456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous Multi-Tier Networks: Improper Signaling for Joint Rate-Energy Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8568990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous Multi-Tier Networks: Improper Signaling for Joint Rate-Energy Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568990/","volume":"18","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8568990/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18400973","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Research Foundation (DFG) for the SE 1967/16-1 Fibonnacci Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneous Multi-Tier Networks: Improper Signaling for Joint Rate-Energy Optimization","sourcePdf":"twc-kariminezhad-2884456-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111835S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8605558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8605558","articleId":"8568990","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8568995,"authors":[{"name":"Angelica M.

This minimally invasive interface incorporates a drug delivery system for targeted delivery of lysing agents and neurotrophic factors to the nerve surface to locally disrupt the epineurium and allow fascicular selectivity. Multiple platinum (Pt) electrodes were embedded in the microfluidic channels for neural stimulation and recording. The lyse-and-attract cuff electrode (LACE) uses a simple locking mechanism that is adjustable for close contact with nerves of varying diameters. Devices were fabricated using standard Parylene microfabrication techniques resulting in low variability and high device yield. A procedure for the implantation of the LACE was developed and successfully demonstrated in vivo around rat sciatic nerves. The adjustable locking mechanism demonstrated adequate holding strength and fit around the nerves. Benchtop electrochemical characterization of the thin-film Pt electrodes showed that the electrodes possessed high charge storage capacity (>1 mC/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) and low impedances (<;2 kQ at 1 kHz) suitable for neural stimulation and recording. As expected, embedded electrodes demonstrated higher impedance values. Acute neural recording from the rat sciatic nerve verified the capability of the LACE to record evoked neural activity (compound action potentials). Controlled and localized microfluidic infusions were achieved at low flow rates (<;1 \u03bcL/min). Finally, infusion experiments in vivo demonstrated targeted drug delivery to the sciatic nerve fascicles. This multifunctional peripheral nerve interface has the potential to enhance implant-tissue integration in vivo and provide reliable chronic performance not available in the existing extraneural or intraneural interfaces.","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2018.2881908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8632823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2018.2881908","endPage":"49","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/84/8632823/08568995.pdf","startPage":"36","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parylene-Based Cuff Electrode With Integrated Microfluidics for Peripheral Nerve Recording, Stimulation, and Drug Delivery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8568995/","displayDocTitle":"Parylene-Based Cuff Electrode With Integrated Microfluidics for Peripheral Nerve Recording, Stimulation, and Drug Delivery","volume":"28","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"18416278","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8568995/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","grantNumber":"HR0011-15-2-0006"},{"fundingName":"Viterbi School of Engineering Ph.D. Merit Fellowship (AC)"},{"fundingName":"USC Provost Fellowships (CL)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parylene-Based Cuff Electrode With Integrated Microfluidics for Peripheral Nerve Recording, Stimulation, and Drug Delivery","sourcePdf":"jmems-meng-2881908-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122478S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"8632823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8632823","articleId":"8568995","onlineDate":"07 December 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8569014,"authors":[{"name":"Yuki Kunisada","affiliation":["Chubu University, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Kunisada","id":"37086545068"},{"name":"Takayoshi Yamashita","affiliation":["Chubu University, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Takayoshi","lastName":"Yamashita","id":"37085338365"},{"name":"Hironobu Fujiyoshi","affiliation":["Chubu University, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Hironobu","lastName":"Fujiyoshi","id":"37270300700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569014","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pedestrian-Detection Method based on 1D-CNN during LiDAR Rotation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569014","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Laser radar","Feature extraction","Lasers","Interpolation","Convolution","Euclidean distance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","object detection","optical radar","pedestrians","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["one-dimensional convolution neural network","LiDAR sensor rotation","actual positions","detected positions","LiDAR waveform data","pedestrian detection method","conventional pedestrian detection methods","vehicles","autonomous driving system","LiDAR rotation","1D-CNN"]}],"abstract":"Pedestrian detection in autonomous driving systems is important for preventing accidents involving pedestrians and vehicles. Conventional pedestrian detection methods involve Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), which requires clustering points into a cloud before determining whether each point is a pedestrian. Therefore, there may not be sufficient time for an autonomous driving system to ensure safety if a pedestrian and vehicle are too close to each other. We propose a pedestrian detection method that is based on a one-dimensional convolution neural network (lD-CNN) that processes LiDAR waveform data without delay. The proposed method sequentially inputs LiDAR waveform data to the 1D-CNN and determines whether each point belongs to a pedestrian. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the difference between the detected and actual positions of pedestrian since our method can be used during LiDAR sensor rotation.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569014","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569014.pdf","startPage":"2692","endPage":"2697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Pedestrian-Detection Method based on 1D-CNN during LiDAR Rotation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18308918","htmlLink":"/document/8569014/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pedestrian-Detection Method based on 1D-CNN during LiDAR Rotation","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0728.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092651S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8569032,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"8569032","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Awards"]}],"abstract":"The 2018 Scott Helt Memorial Award was awarded to Seho Myung, Sung-Ik Park, Kyung-Joong Kim, Jae-Young Lee, Sunhyoung Kwon, Jeongchang Kim, for their paper, \u201cOffset and Normalized Min-Sum Algorithms for ATSC 3.0 LDPC Decoder.\u201d The papers appeared in the IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting, vol. 63, no. 4, pp. 734\u2013739, Dec. 2017.

As a result of using lower figure-of-merit (FOM) devices, significant efficiency gains are observed for the LV and HV converters developed in this paper compared to a two-level topology. Smaller passive size (mainly inductors) also provides a significant increase in power density for the LV converter. A startup scheme is discussed which eliminates the need for extraneous control loops or high voltage rated devices for the top switch. Finally, an electrical performance comparison is also shown for a two-stage intermediate bus architecture (IBA) developed with the GaN based three-level converter for the front end and a high frequency GaN-based second buck stage for 48 V to 1 V point-of-load (PoL) conversion. Two choices of intermediate bus voltage are investigated: 12 V and 6 V. Each bus voltage demonstrates its advantage in a certain range of load current.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Gallium nitride","Logic

First, a solar irradiance information platform is set up to collect the relevant data for the solar irradiance forecasting. The solar irradiance information platform includes a pyranometer, a single board computer, a camera and a cloud server. By integrating the software and hardware of the solar irradiance information platform, real-time solar irradiances and sky images can be captured and stored in the MySQL database of the cloud server. Then, these solar irradiances and sky images are used to establish a neural network forecasting system.

We propose a method for automatic license plate recognition in-the-wild based on a geometric alignment of license plates as a preceding step for holistic license plate recognition. The alignment is done by a Convolutional Neural Network that estimates control points for rectifying the image and the following rectification step is formulated so that the whole alignment and recognition process can be assembled into one computational graph of a contemporary neural network framework, such as Tensorflow. The experiments show that the use of the aligner helps the recognition considerably: the error rate dropped from 9.6 % to 2.1 % on real-life images of license plates.

This paper investigates the average transmission power minimization problem while stabilizing all transmission and computation queues under tasks QoS requirement constraints, in which the influence of time-varying channel on the resource allocation strategies is considered. By utilizing the vehicle channel predictability and Lyapunov optimization technique, the primal problem can be decomposed into two subproblems. The computation resource allocation subproblem can be solved easily. For the radio resource allocation subproblem, we transform it into a single variable problem and propose an algorithm to solve it. By utilizing the results of two subproblems, a joint radio and computation resource allocation (JRCRA) algorithm is proposed. The effect of small-scale fading on JRCRA algorithm is analyzed. The simulation results show that the proposed JRCRA algorithm can achieve better performance compared with the traditional greedy algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569271","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569271.pdf","startPage":"3736","endPage":"3741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Radio and Computation Resource Allocation with Predictable Channel in Vehicular Edge Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Joint Radio and Computation Resource Allocation with Predictable Channel in Vehicular Edge Computing","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18324422","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8569271/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Radio and Computation Resource Allocation with Predictable Channel in Vehicular Edge Computing","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0707.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118791S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8569286,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","id":"37086543514"},{"name":"Yifan Dang","affiliation":["University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Dang","id":"37086547043"},{"name":"Tefang Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Tefang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086543744"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569286","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Resource management","Task analysis","Wireless communication","Energy consumption","Mathematical model","Intelligent vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","intelligent transportation systems","mobile radio","quality of service","resource allocation","stochastic processes","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicular edge cloud computing","intelligent vehicles onboard computational power","autonomous vehicles","vehicular system","wireless network resources allocation scheme","vehicular computing tasks","vehicular energy consumption","quality of service","stochastic fair allocation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["vehicular edge computing","computing offloading","wireless resource allocation","energy efficiency"]}],"abstract":"Recently, with the rapid development of autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles, the demands of vehicular computing keep continuously growing. We notice a constant and limited onboard computational ability can hardly keep up with the rising requirements of the vehicular system and software application during their long-term lifetime, and also at the same time, the vehicles onboard computation causes an increasingly higher vehicular energy consumption. Therefore, we suppose to build a vehicular edge cloud computing (VECC) framework to resolve such a vehicular computing dilemma. In this framework, potential vehicular computing tasks can be executed remotely in an edge cloud within their time latency constraints. Simultaneously, an effective wireless network resources allocation scheme is one of the essential and fundamental factors for the QoS (quality of Service) on the VECC. In this paper, we adopted a stochastic fair allocation (SFA) algorithm to randomly allocate minimum required resource blocks to admitted vehicular users. The numerical results show a great effectiveness of energy efficiency in VECC.","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569286.pdf","startPage":"3421","endPage":"3426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicular Edge Cloud Computing: Depressurize the Intelligent Vehicles Onboard Computational Power","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569286","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569286/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Vehicular Edge Cloud Computing: Depressurize the Intelligent Vehicles Onboard Computational Power","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18324363","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8569286/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicular Edge Cloud Computing: Depressurize the Intelligent Vehicles Onboard Computational Power","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129924S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8569291,"authors":[{"name":"Niels Ole Salscheider","affiliation":["FZI Research Center for Information Technology at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Niels Ole","lastName":"Salscheider","id":"37085394720"},{"name":"Martin Lauer","affiliation":["Institute for Measurement and Control Systems Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Lauer","id":"37082886500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569291","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Semantics","Encoding","Convolutional neural networks","Cameras","Task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","feedforward neural nets","image segmentation","intelligent transportation systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["instance segmentation","pixel neighbour relations","camera images","deep learning","convolutional neural network","object instances","encoding based approaches","long-range neighbour relations","direct neighbour pixels","CNN","automated vehicles","object locations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569291","abstract":"Instance segmentation is an important task in the context of automated vehicles. It allows to get precise object locations and shapes from camera images. In this paper, we propose an approach to instance segmentation based on deep learning. A convolutional neural network predicts relations between neighbour pixels. It also predicts which regions of the image lie inside instances. This representation is then decoded to get the object instances. Our approach achieves an average precision of 13.9 % over all classes on the validation dataset of the challenging Cityscapes benchmark. In contrast to other encoding based approaches, the presented approach can associate freestanding (unconnected) areas of the same instance. This problem can arise if an object is partially occluded. It is solved by learning long-range neighbour relations that do not only consider direct neighbour pixels. We show that these long-range neighbour relations result in higher accuracies for all classes.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569291","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569291.pdf","startPage":"3463","endPage":"3468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instance Segmentation by Learning Pixel Neighbour Relations with a CNN","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Instance Segmentation by Learning Pixel Neighbour Relations with a CNN","htmlLink":"/document/8569291/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18309043","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instance Segmentation by Learning Pixel Neighbour Relations with a CNN","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0452.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064415S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8569308,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Zeng","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37086344459"},{"name":"Jiayi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiayi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085548297"},{"name":"Kostas P.

We present a LiDAR-based 3D object detection pipeline entailing three stages. First, laser information is projected into a novel cell encoding for bird's eye view projection. Later, both object location on the plane and its heading are estimated through a convolutional neural network originally designed for image processing. Finally, 3D oriented detections are computed in a post-processing phase. Experiments on KITTI dataset show that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results among comparable methods. Further tests with different LiDAR sensors in real scenarios assess the multi-device capabilities of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569311","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569311.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","startPage":"3517","endPage":"3523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BirdNet: A 3D Object Detection Framework from LiDAR Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"BirdNet: A 3D Object Detection Framework from LiDAR Information","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569311/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18308776","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8569311/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BirdNet: A 3D Object Detection Framework from LiDAR Information","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0996.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1133S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8569327,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38187472600"},{"name":"Lixin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lixin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086546622"},{"name":"Dingyuan Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dingyuan","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085883290"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4112-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4113-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7209"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2155-7195"}],"articleNumber":"8569327","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":635},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Resource management","Satellites","Interference","Satellite communication","Packet loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beam steering","quality of service","resource allocation","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beam size","beam resource management algorithm","beam range","spectrum resources","user communication quality","effective resource allocation mechanism","communication satellite capacity","power resources","satellite systems","beam Hopping communication system","beam position","beam bandwidth resources","service distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["beam hopping","RRM","system capacity","QoS"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569327","abstract":"Beam-Hopping provides satellite systems with an additional dimension of agility making it possible to adjust the allocation of the scarce satellite spectral and power resources to the demand which varies in space and geography as well as with time.

The existing beam steering mainly focus on covering the beam position which largest demand the spectrum resources and do not fully utilize the advantages brought by the flexibility in beam range. In this paper, we propose a beam resource management algorithm that adjusts the beam size according to the service distribution, which can make more users accessible to make full use of beam bandwidth resources by covering more beam positions.

In a set of numerical experiments, four ANN models (ranging in structure from a model that is able to exactly capture a classical car following model, to a generic neural network model) are proposed and then trained from data and their resulting accuracy is assessed. It is shown that by adding structure into the neural network (i.e., via the architecture and the activation functions), it is possible to outperform generic ANN models to emergent phenomena such as stop and go waves.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569333/","accessionNumber":"18308710","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8569333/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Connections between classical car following models and artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connections between classical car following models and artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0958.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054104S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8569341,"authors":[{"name":"Minghao Shen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control, Jilin University, China"],"firstName":"Minghao","lastName":"Shen","id":"37086543980"},{"name":"Hanyang Hu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control, Jilin University, China"],"firstName":"Hanyang","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086544506"},{"name":"Bohua Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control, Jilin University, China"],"firstName":"Bohua","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086156973"},{"name":"Weiwen Deng","affiliation":["Department of Automotive Engineering, Jilin University, China"],"firstName":"Weiwen","lastName":"Deng","id":"38494315300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569341","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Merging","Trajectory","Optimization","Collision avoidance","Decision making","Automobiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","decision making","mobile robots","motion control","optimal control","path planning","road traffic control","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated framework","lane change decision making","longitudinal motion planning","collision avoidance","optimal control based heuristics","lane change decisions","planning algorithm","simple sequential planning policy","ramp merging scenario","highway traffic","existing planning algorithms","longitudinal motion coordination","lateral lane change","main lanes","road capacity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569341","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569341.pdf","startPage":"1266","endPage":"1272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heuristics Based Cooperative Planning for Highway On-Ramp Merge","abstract":"On ramp merging scenario is critical to mobility and safety of highway traffic.

It is expensive to test autonomous vehicles in the field, and therefore virtual testing methods are needed. Generative models of maneuvers such as cut-ins, overtakes, and lane-keeping are needed to thoroughly test the autonomous vehicle in a virtual environment. To train such models we need ground truth maneuver labels and obtaining such labels can be time-consuming and costly. In this work, we use a mixture of hidden Markov models to find clusters in maneuver trajectories, which can be used to speed up the labeling process. The maneuver trajectories are noisy, asynchronous and of uneven length, which make hidden Markov models a good fit for the data. The method is evaluated on labeled data from a test track consisting of cut-ins and overtakes with favorable results. Further, it is applied to natural data where many of the clusters found can be interpreted as driver maneuvers under reasonable assumptions. We show that mixtures of hidden Markov models can be used to find motion patterns in driver maneuver data from highways and country roads.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering Vehicle Maneuver Trajectories Using Mixtures of Hidden Markov Models","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569418","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569418.pdf","startPage":"3698","endPage":"3705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569418/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Clustering Vehicle Maneuver Trajectories Using Mixtures of Hidden Markov Models","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8569418/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18309089","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering Vehicle Maneuver Trajectories Using Mixtures of Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05385S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":8569427,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Fung Chu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Kai Fung","lastName":"Chu","id":"37086259467"},{"name":"Albert Y.S.

Given the predicted future travel demand, service providers can coordinate their available vehicles such that they are pre-allocated to the customers' origins of service in advance to reduce waiting time. Traditional approaches on future travel demand prediction rely on statistical or machine learning methods. Advancement in sensor technology generates huge amount of data, which enables the data-driven intelligent transportation system. In this paper, inspired by deep learning techniques for image and video processing, we propose a new deep learning model, called Multi-Scale Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (MultiConvLSTM), by considering travel demand as image pixel values. MultiConvLSTM considers both temporal and spatial correlations to predict the future travel demand. Experiments on real-world New York taxi data with around 400 million records are performed. We show that MultiConvLSTM outperforms the existing prediction methods for travel demand prediction and achieves the highest accuracy among all in both one-step and multiple-step predictions.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569427","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569427.pdf","startPage":"1402","endPage":"1407","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Travel Demand Prediction using Deep Multi-Scale Convolutional LSTM Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Travel Demand Prediction using Deep Multi-Scale Convolutional LSTM Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18308890","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8569427/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Travel Demand Prediction using Deep Multi-Scale Convolutional LSTM Network","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073182S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8569433,"authors":[{"name":"Sascha Wirges","affiliation":["Mobile Perception Systems Group, FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Sascha","lastName":"Wirges","id":"37077515700"},{"name":"Tom Fischer","affiliation":["Mobile Perception Systems Group, FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Fischer","id":"37086544495"},{"name":"Christoph Stiller","affiliation":["Mobile Perception Systems Group, FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Stiller","id":"37284652100"},{"name":"Jesus Balado Frias","affiliation":["Applied Geotechnologies Research Group, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"firstName":"Jesus Balado","lastName":"Frias","id":"37086546381"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569433","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":913},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569433","abstract":"Detailed environment perception is a crucial component of automated vehicles.

Human vision plays a crucial role in this task and analysis of the gaze behavior could provide some insights into the action the driver takes upon seeing an object/region. A typical representation of the gaze behavior is a saliency map. The work in this paper aims to predict this saliency map given a sequence of image frames. Strategies are developed to address important topics for video saliency including active gaze (i.e. gaze that is useful for driving), pixel- and object-level information, and suppression of non-negative pixels in the saliency maps. These strategies enabled the development of a novel pixel- and object-level saliency ground truth dataset using real-world driving data around traffic intersections. We further proposed a fully convolutional RNN architecture capable of handling time sequence image data to estimate saliency map.

Therefore, recurrent models are a natural choice to address path prediction tasks, where a trained model is used to generate future expectations from past observations. When applied to security applications, like predicting pedestrian paths for risk assessment, a point-wise greedy evaluation of the output pdf is not feasible, since the environment often allows multiple choices. Therefore, a robust risk assessment has to take all options into account, even if they are overall not very likely. Towards this end, a combination of particle filtering strategies and a LSTM-MDL model is proposed to address a multimodal path prediction task. The capabilities and viability of the proposed approach are evaluated on several synthetic test conditions, yielding the counter-intuitive result that the simplest approach performs best. Further, the feasibility of the proposed approach is illustrated on several real world scenes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18308753","htmlLink":"/document/8569478/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Particle-based Pedestrian Path Prediction using LSTM-MDL Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle-based Pedestrian Path Prediction using LSTM-MDL Models","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0668.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075134S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8569500,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Wittmann","affiliation":["Chair of Automotive Technology, Technical University of Munich, Garching, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Wittmann","id":"37694830100"},{"name":"Michael Kollek","affiliation":["Chair of Automotive Technology, Technical University of Munich, Garching, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Kollek","id":"37086544483"},{"name":"Markus Lienkamp","affiliation":["Chair of Automotive Technology, Technical University of Munich, Garching, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Lienkamp","id":"38499655800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569500","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Public transportation","Sparse matrices","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Principal component analysis","Global Positioning System","Urban areas","Time series analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","Global Positioning System","principal component analysis","time series","traffic engineering computing","traffic information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-driven anomalies","spatiotemporal taxi passseger demand","grid-based approach","anomalous pickup patterns","spatiotemporal passenger demand","public events","developed method","large-scale taxi dataset","offline sources","equally distributed grid level","robust principle component analysis","demand fluctuations","large-scale mobility datasets","historical taxi GPS data mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["on-demand mobility","taxi-passenger demand","time-series analysis","anomaly-detection","robust principle component analysis (RPCA)"]}],"abstract":"We propose a grid-based approach of mining historical taxi GPS data to study anomalous pickup patterns in spatiotemporal passenger demand caused by public events.

To harmoniously share traffic resources, self-driving vehicles need to respect behavioral customs of human drivers. Taking on-road driving for example, self-driving vehicles are supposed to behave in a human-like way to decide when to keep the lane and when to change the lane. This point, however, has not been well addressed in current on-road maneuver decision methods. In this paper, a human-like maneuver decision method based on Long Short Term Memory (LST-M) neural network and Conditional Random Field (CRF) model is proposed for on-road self-driving. Different from previous works, this paper considers the maneuver decision problem as a sequence labeling problem. Its input is a time-series vector which describes a period of neighboring traffic history, and its output is a one-hot vector indicates the suitable maneuver. The proposed model is trained on the NGSIM public dataset, which contains millions of driving maneuvers collected from thousands of human drivers. Simulations with manipulated conditions reveal human-like reasoning for maneuver decision inside the proposed model. Comparative experiments further demonstrate a better human-like performance achieved by the proposed method than that of previous methods.","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569524.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human-Like Maneuver Decision Using LSTM-CRF Model for On-Road Self-Driving","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569524","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Human-Like Maneuver Decision Using LSTM-CRF Model for On-Road Self-Driving","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18308796","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8569524/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human-Like Maneuver Decision Using LSTM-CRF Model for On-Road Self-Driving","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073372S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8569552,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Krajewski","affiliation":["Automated Driving Department, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Krajewski","id":"37085847898"},{"name":"Julian Bock","affiliation":["Automated Driving Department, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Bock","id":"37086543949"},{"name":"Laurent Kloeker","affiliation":["Automated Driving Department, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Kloeker","id":"37086544119"},{"name":"Lutz Eckstein","affiliation":["Automated Driving Department, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Lutz","lastName":"Eckstein","id":"37598017400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569552","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":102,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2400},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Sensors","Drones","Trajectory","Safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","driver information systems","road safety","road traffic","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["German highways","road users","naturalistic behavior","reasonable effort","measurement data","necessary scenario information","real-world scenarios","highly automated vehicles","scenario-based testing","highly automated driving systems","naturalistic vehicle trajectories","drone dataset","highD dataset","large-scale naturalistic vehicle trajectory dataset","scenario-based validation","current measurement methods"]}],"abstract":"Scenario-based testing for the safety validation of highly automated vehicles is a promising approach that is being examined in research and industry.

When given a terminal airspace design, the fuel consumption model calculates the fleet-wide fuel burn based on the departure/arrival profiles as specified in the design.

The model is trained and evaluated using Digital Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data from real operations. We demonstrate the proposed MLPNN method via a case study of Hong Kong airspace and compare its performance with two other regression methods, the robust linear regression (the least median of squares, LMS) method and the r-Insensitive support vector regression (SVR) method. Cross-validation results indicate that the MLPNN performs better than the other two regression methods, with a prediction accuracy of 96.02% on average. Finally, we use the proposed model to estimate the potential fuel burn savings on three standard arrival procedures in Hong Kong airspace.

Due to the high number of daily users, crowded environments can lead to limited seating requiring passengers to stand during their commute. Standing passengers are at risk during heavy braking scenarios and can also become a hazard to other seated passengers. Similarly, those who may not have a strong balance, or physically impaired such as the elderly endure a risk when vehicle braking is sudden. In this research, a method of analysing posture via simplistic pressure mat data is achieved. The integration of identifying a passenger's posture in relation to their balance may have the potential to inform public transport operators on the levels of braking that can be used based on their passengers at the time. Additionally, the identification of passengers using hand rail supports derived from floor mats only will inform operators of the potential risk during sudden braking.

using Dual LSTM Networks","abstract":"As autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to interact with other road users, it is of importance to comprehensively understand the dynamic traffic environment, especially the future possible trajectories of surrounding vehicles. This paper presents an algorithm for long-horizon trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles using a dual long short term memory (LSTM) network, which is capable of effectively improving prediction accuracy in strongly interactive driving environments. In contrast to traditional approaches which require trajectory matching and manual feature selection, this method can automatically learn high-level spatial-temporal features of driver behaviors from naturalistic driving data through sequence learning. By employing two blocks of LSTMs, the proposed method feeds the sequential trajectory to the first LSTM for driver intention recognition as an intermediate indicator, which is immediately followed by a second LSTM for future trajectory prediction. Test results from real-world highway driving data show that the proposed method can, in comparison to state-of-art methods, output more accurate and reasonable estimate of different future trajectories over 5s time horizon with root mean square error (RMSE) for longitudinal and lateral prediction less than 5.77m and 0.49m, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18309084","htmlLink":"/document/8569595/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Intention-aware Long Horizon Trajectory Prediction of Surrounding Vehicles using Dual LSTM Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intention-aware Long Horizon Trajectory Prediction of Surrounding Vehicles using Dual LSTM Networks","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0680.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068048S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8569620,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Ju Lee","affiliation":["Smart Data Research Group, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Ju","lastName":"Lee","id":"37311321800"},{"name":"OkGee Min","affiliation":["Smart Data Research Group, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"OkGee","lastName":"Min","id":"37563660400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569620","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569620","abstract":"Traffic prediction is an important research issue for solving the traffic congestion problems in an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS).

The article compares two different LiDARs (Ibeo Lux and Velodyne PUCK), which both use the 905 nm wavelengths, which are used in more than 95% of currently available LiDARs. The performance was tested and estimated in stabilized fog conditions at Cerema fog chamber facilities. This provides a good basis for repeating the same validation procedure multiple times and ensuring the right development decisions. However, performance of the LiDARs suffers when the weather conditions become adverse and visibility range decreases. A 50% reduction in target detection performance was observed over the exhaustive tests. Therefore, changing to higher wavelengths (1550 nm) was considered using redesigned \u201cpre-prototype LiDAR\u201d. The preliminary results indicate that there is no reason to not use 1550 nm wavelength, which due to eye safety regulations gives an opportunity to use 20 times more power compared to the traditional 905 nm. In order to clarify the expected benefits, additional feasibility studies are still needed.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569624","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569624.pdf","startPage":"1695","endPage":"1701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automotive LiDAR performance verification in fog and rain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569624/","displayDocTitle":"Automotive LiDAR performance verification in fog and rain","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18324406","htmlLink":"/document/8569624/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automotive LiDAR performance verification in fog and rain","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050006S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8569635,"authors":[{"name":"Aidin Ferdowsi","affiliation":["Wireless@VT, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Aidin","lastName":"Ferdowsi","id":"37086222732"},{"name":"Ursula Challita","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ursula","lastName":"Challita","id":"37085418309"},{"name":"Walid Saad","affiliation":["Wireless@VT, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Walid","lastName":"Saad","id":"37392237900"},{"name":"Narayan B.

In this paper, the state estimation process for monitoring AV dynamics, in presence of CP attacks, is analyzed and a novel adversarial deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to maximize the robustness of AV dynamics control to CP attacks. The attacker's action and the AV's reaction to CP attacks are studied in a game-theoretic framework. In the formulated game, the attacker seeks to inject faulty data to AV sensor readings so as to manipulate the inter-vehicle optimal safe spacing and potentially increase the risk of AV accidents or reduce the vehicle flow on the roads. Meanwhile, the AV, acting as a defender, seeks to minimize the deviations of spacing so as to ensure robustness to the attacker's actions. Since the AV has no information about the attacker's action and due to the infinite possibilities for data value manipulations, each player uses long short term memory (LSTM) blocks to learn the expected spacing deviation resulting from its own action and feeds this deviation to a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. Then, the attacker's RL algorithm chooses the action which maximizes the spacing deviation, while the AV's RL algorithm seeks to find the optimal action that minimizes such deviation. Simulation results show that the proposed adversarial deep RL algorithm can improve the robustness of the AV dynamics control as it minimizes the intra-AV spacing deviation.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569635","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569635.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning for Security and Safety in Autonomous Vehicle Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning for Security and Safety in Autonomous Vehicle Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569635/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18308709","htmlLink":"/document/8569635/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning for Security and Safety in Autonomous Vehicle Systems","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08289S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8569637,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Truong Le","affiliation":["Fortiss GmbH, affiliated, institute of Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael Truong","lastName":"Le","id":"37086546437"},{"name":"Frederik Diehl","affiliation":["Fortiss GmbH, affiliated, institute of Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Frederik","lastName":"Diehl","id":"37086147762"},{"name":"Thomas Brunner","affiliation":["Fortiss GmbH, affiliated, institute of Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Brunner","id":"37075341500"},{"name":"Alois Knol","affiliation":["Robotics and Embedded Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Alois","lastName":"Knol","id":"37085612075"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569637","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":528},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uncertainty Estimation for Deep Neural Object Detectors in Safety-Critical Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569637","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Detectors","Estimation","Object detection","Neural networks","Prediction algorithms","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection","probability","safety-critical software","uncertainty handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detection networks","high inference times","multibox detections","false positives","uncertainty maps","deep neural object detectors","safety-critical applications","object detection algorithms","safety-critical systems","automated driving","deep neural networks","aleatoric uncertainty estimation algorithms","deep learning","predictions"]}],"abstract":"Object detection algorithms are essential components for perceiving the environment in safety-critical systems like automated driving.

Established algorithms for estimating uncertainty can either not be directly applied to object detection networks or result in high inference times. Instead, we adapt an existing method for aleatoric uncertainty estimation and propose another simple and efficient algorithm which is directly based on the multi-box detections. We show that these methods are able to assign high uncertainty values to false positives and visualize these in uncertainty maps.

The low level visual features learned from this system were found to be highly informative for the discrete intention prediction task (i.e., predicting whether a pedestrian is stopping or crossing), and achieved high performance on the Daimler benchmark. This is despite a much smaller training dataset than is normally used for training deep learning models. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply deep learning to this problem without using externally trained pedestrian pose estimation systems. Our system performs comparable to the state-of-the-art approach that relies on pose estimation, and runs in real time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object tracking","Feature

safe handover of the driving task or driver-adaptive warning strategies the driver's situation awareness is a helpful source of information. In order to estimate and track the driver's focus of attention over time in a dynamic automotive scene, a Multi-Hypothesis Multi-Model probabilistic tracking framework was developed in which we postulate consistency between machine and human perception during gaze fixations. Within this framework, we explicitly included target object motion in the spatial transition step and integrated spatiotemporal models of human-like gaze behavior for fixations and saccades in the motion transition. This elaborate design makes the target estimation robust and yet flexible. At the same time, the representation in continuous 2D coordinates makes the algorithm run in real time on a standard laptop. By incorporating dynamic and static potential gaze targets from an object list and a free space spline, the algorithm is in principle independent from the applied sensor setup. The benefit of the proposed model is presented on real world data where the filter's tracking performance as well as the driver's visual sampling are presented based on an exemplary scene.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8569655/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18308769","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Hypothesis Multi-Model Driver's Gaze Target Tracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Hypothesis Multi-Model Driver's Gaze Target Tracking","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092305S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8569659,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Driving record instruments are required to be installed on such vehicles in China. The obtained naturalistic driving data offer insight into the causal factors of hazardous events with the requirements to identify where hazardous events happen within large volumes of data. In this study, we develop a model based on a low-definition driving record instrument and the vehicle kinematic data for post-accident analysis by multi-modal deep learning method. With a higher camera position on commercial vehicles than cars that can observe further distance, motion profiles are extracted from driving video to capture the trajectory features of front vehicles at different depths. Then random forest is used to select significant kinematic variables which can reflect the potential crash. Finally, a multi-modal deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) combined both video and kinematic data is developed to identify potential collision risk in each 12-second vehicle trip. The analysis results indicate that the proposed multi-modal deep learning model can identify hazardous events within a large volumes of data at an AUC of 0.81, which outperforms the state-of-the-art random forest model and kinematic threshold method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569659","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569659.pdf","startPage":"3352","endPage":"3357","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting Hazardous Driving Events Using Multi-Modal Deep Learning Based on Video Motion Profile and Kinematics Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Predicting Hazardous Driving Events Using Multi-Modal Deep Learning Based on Video Motion Profile and Kinematics Data","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8569659/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18308872","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569659/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting Hazardous Driving Events Using Multi-Modal Deep Learning Based on Video Motion Profile and Kinematics Data","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0795.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065188S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8569661,"authors":[{"name":"Ian Rhys Jenkins","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chalmers I University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ian Rhys","lastName":"Jenkins","id":"37086543605"},{"name":"Ludvig Oliver Gee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chalmers I University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ludvig Oliver","lastName":"Gee","id":"37086543052"},{"name":"Alessia Knauss","affiliation":["Veoneer Research, V\u00e5ra\u00e5rda, Sweden"],"firstName":"Alessia","lastName":"Knauss","id":"38509479800"},{"name":"Hang Yin","affiliation":["Zenuity, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Yin","id":"37086008796"},{"name":"Jan Schroeder","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chalmers I University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Schroeder","id":"37085343236"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569661","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":477},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accidents","Testing","Prototypes","Task analysis","Recurrent neural networks","Neurons","Manuals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accidents","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots","recurrent neural nets","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning","temporal data","autonomous drive systems testing","V2X data","accident scenario generation","automated approach","accident scenarios","recurrent neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569661","abstract":"There is a lack of approaches to derive accident scenarios automatically for the testing of Autonomous Drive systems.

The problem of pedestrian classification finds applications in advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) and autonomous driving, and it has regained particular attention recently because, among other reasons, safety involving self-driving vehicles. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is used in this work as classifier in distinct situations: having a single sensor data as input, and by combining data from both sensors in the CNN input layer. Range (distance) and intensity (reflectance) data from LIDAR are considered as separate channels, where data from the LIDAR sensor is feed to the CNN in the form of dense maps, as the result of sensor coordinate transformation and spatial filtering; this allows a direct implementation of the same CNN-based approach on both sensors data. In terms of late-fusion, the outputs from individual CNNs are combined by means of learning and non-learning approaches. Pedestrian classification is evaluated on a `binary classification' dataset created from the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite, and results are shown for each sensor-modality individually, and for the fusion strategies.","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569666.pdf","startPage":"3138","endPage":"3143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569666","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multimodal CNN Pedestrian Classification: A Study on Combining LIDAR and Camera Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multimodal CNN Pedestrian Classification: A Study on Combining LIDAR and Camera Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569666/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8569666/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18308892","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodal CNN Pedestrian Classification: A Study on Combining LIDAR and Camera Data","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0943.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082322S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8569672,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyuan Huang","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086011727"},{"name":"Mansur Arief","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Mansur","lastName":"Arief","id":"37086430549"},{"name":"Henry Lam","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"Lam","id":"37085669790"},{"name":"Ding Zhao","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085680141"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569672","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Response surface methodology","Autonomous vehicles","Safety","Numerical models","Testing","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-road tests","test tracks","autonomous vehicle test approaches"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569672","abstract":"Currently, the most prevalent way to evaluate an autonomous vehicle is to directly test it on the public road.

In this paper, we propose to use a co-Kriging model to synthesize the results from different evaluation approaches, which allows us to fully utilize the information and provides an accurate, affordable, and safe way to assess a design of an autonomous vehicle.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569672","startPage":"2000","endPage":"2005","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569672.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of Different Autonomous Vehicles Test Approaches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569672/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of Different Autonomous Vehicles Test Approaches","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8569672/","accessionNumber":"18308698","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of Different Autonomous Vehicles Test Approaches","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0708.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077185S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8569695,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A fully 3D local obstacle grid, maintained through multiple frames and updated accordingly to the UAV movement, is built accumulating multiple observations coming from the 360 stereo vision sensing suite. Visual data is also used to extract information regarding the drone attitude and position while exploring the environment. Sparse optical flow collected from both front and down facing stereo cameras is used to estimate UAV movement through multiple frames. The down-looking stereo pair is also used to estimate the drone height from the ground and to refine the pose estimation in a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) fashion. An improved A* planning algorithm exploits both the 3D representation of the surroundings and precise localization information in order to find the shortest path and reach the goal through a three dimensional safe trajectory.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569695","startPage":"3886","endPage":"3891","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569695.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling Computer Vision-Based Autonomous Navigation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Cluttered GPS-Denied Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Drones","Cameras","Three-dimensional displays","Simultaneous localization and mapping","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","cameras","collision avoidance","image representation","image sequences","mobile robots","navigation","path planning","pose estimation","robot vision","SLAM (robots)","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cluttered GPS-denied environments","computer vision processing modules","visual information","omni-directional stereo-vision based setup","fully 3D local obstacle grid","360 stereo vision sensing suite","visual data","stereo cameras","simultaneous localization and mapping","localization information","unmanned aerial vehicles","computer vision-based autonomous navigation","vision-based autonomous UAV systems","3D representation","drone","optical flow","down-looking stereo pair","pose estimation","SLAM","A* planning algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["thermomechanical treatment","Intelligent vehicles","autonomous UAV","indoor navigation","stereo vision","self-localization","obstacle detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569695/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Enabling Computer Vision-Based Autonomous Navigation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Cluttered GPS-Denied Environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8569695/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18308688","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling Computer Vision-Based Autonomous Navigation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Cluttered GPS-Denied Environments","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073414S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":8569726,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Zhang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086544569"},{"name":"Linan Zhang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Linan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086355135"},{"name":"Yangdong Liu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yangdong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086355147"},{"name":"Xiaoguang Yang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoguang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37275558400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569726","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569726","abstract":"Bike-sharing has experienced rapid development worldwide in the last decade. Accurate usage prediction is necessary to support timely reposition and ensure availability. Existing prediction methods of bike-sharing usage are mostly based on its own history. They can capture temporal characteristics under normal state but cannot respond to sudden events. Bike-sharing is a part of public transport. The interrelation of bike-sharing and other public transport systems can be utilized to capture the impact of sudden events. This prediction approach considers both historical usage and real-time passengers of public transport. Then use neural networks to establish the connection among them. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is adopted because it shows outstanding performance to learn long-term temporal dependencies. Experiments show that the prediction through this approach is more accurate than baselines. The mean absolute error (MAE) reduces by 25.32% to 39.82%. With the input of real-time boarding passengers, the prediction better responds to sudden changes, and the MAE value further reduces by 21.81%. This approach also outperforms others in different prediction horizons. Moreover, the methodology is applicable to both traditional and station-free bike-sharing systems. Data for the prediction are available in many cities, and hence it is ready for practice.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569726","startPage":"1564","endPage":"1571","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569726.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-term Prediction of Bike-sharing Usage Considering Public Transport: A LSTM Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Market research","Logic gates","Real-time systems","Recurrent neural networks","Roads","Bicycles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bicycles","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","traffic engineering computing","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bike-sharing usage","LSTM approach","prediction methods","public transport systems","prediction approach","historical usage","long-term temporal dependencies","real-time boarding passengers","traditional station-free bike-sharing","long short-term memory","short-term prediction","mean absolute error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hike-sharing","usage","prediction","long short-term memory (LSTM)","public transport"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Short-term Prediction of Bike-sharing Usage Considering Public Transport: A LSTM Approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8569726/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18308820","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-term Prediction of Bike-sharing Usage Considering Public Transport: A LSTM Approach","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066236S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8569731,"authors":[{"name":"Ajinkya S.

The travel time was aggregated at 15-minute intervals. The developed models were tested by considering the travel time data for the year 2016.

They self-organize to give or take right-of-way without being regulated by explicit traffic rules. The safety based on their behavior patterns in such areas is, hence, critical and needs to be fully investigated. In this paper, we first carry out a collision probability method based on safety distance to quantitatively study behavior patterns in mixed traffic. Then we propose a Long Short-Term Memories recurrent neural networks model that takes 2D trajectory data at discrete time steps and incorporates collision probability that captures user behavior patterns as a density mapping function for trajectory prediction. The model handles collisions explicitly based on the relative positions of the neighboring users in an ego user's vicinity with considering the impact of personal space and vehicle geometry. It also provides a friend flock detection mechanism to allow close interactions between friends. After training by real-world trajectories, the model outputs comparative results to the state-of-the-art methods for predicting three-second trajectories in complicated situations in a shared space. It can be applied for intent detection and on-board alarming system for autonomous driving when interacting with multimodal road users in shared spaces.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569757","startPage":"3898","endPage":"3904","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569757.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Mixed Traffic in Shared Space Using LSTM with Probability Density Mapping","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Safety","Trajectory","Space vehicles","Geometry","Force","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability","recurrent neural nets","road safety","road traffic","road vehicles","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shared space","vulnerable road users","collision probability method","safety distance","Long Short-Term Memories","2D trajectory data","density mapping function","trajectory prediction","personal space","vehicle geometry","multimodal road users","traffic rules","recurrent neural networks model","user behavior patterns","mixed traffic modeling","LSTM","probability density mapping","on-board alarming system","autonomous driving"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Mixed Traffic in Shared Space Using LSTM with Probability Density Mapping","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8569757/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18308687","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Mixed Traffic in Shared Space Using LSTM with Probability Density Mapping","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058549S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8569765,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Plachetka","affiliation":["Institute of Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Plachetka","id":"37086544267"},{"name":"Jens Rieken","affiliation":["Institute of Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Rieken","id":"37085545448"},{"name":"Markus Maurer","affiliation":["Institute of Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Maurer","id":"37351800500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569765","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The TUBS Road User Dataset: A New LiDAR Dataset and its Application to CNN-based Road User Classification for Automated Vehicles","abstract":"We present a novel approach for classifying pre-segmented laser scans of road users with consideration of real-time capability for applications in automated vehicles.

In order to provide an appropriate maintenance for the turbofan engine to improve the reliability of the system, it is necessary to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the engine. In this paper, a data-based RUL prediction method is proposed using the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). To capture more degradation information, the time window of row data and runtime of the turbofan engine are used as inputs to the proposed method after normalization. LightGBM works very well with these high-dimensional inputs and the model is easy to interpret. Moreover, LightGBM is insensitive to noise and can deal with redundant information in the time-window-size data, which facilitate the application of the proposed method to turbofan engines. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are performed on C-MAPSS datasets provided by NASA, and the high prognostic accuracy is obtained. By comparing with the existing methods using the same dataset, the promising prospects of the proposed method in industry applications are illustrated.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569801","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569801.pdf","startPage":"3562","endPage":"3567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Light Gradient Boosting Machine for Remainning Useful Life Estimation of Aircraft Engines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569801/","displayDocTitle":"A Light Gradient Boosting Machine for Remainning Useful Life Estimation of Aircraft Engines","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18308685","htmlLink":"/document/8569801/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Light Gradient Boosting Machine for Remainning Useful Life Estimation of Aircraft Engines","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079589S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8569814,"authors":[{"name":"Di Feng","affiliation":["Robert Bosch GmbH, Corporate Research, Driver Assistance Systems and Automated Driving, Renningen, Germany"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Feng","id":"37086544464"},{"name":"Lars Rosenbaum","affiliation":["Robert Bosch GmbH, Corporate Research, Driver Assistance Systems and Automated Driving, Renningen, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Rosenbaum","id":"37086546688"},{"name":"Klaus Dietmayer","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement, Control and Microtechnology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Dietmayer","id":"37283417900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569814","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1619},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Three-dimensional displays","Laser radar","Object detection","Proposals","Neural networks","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","control engineering computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots","neural nets","object detection","optical radar","road safety","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capture uncertainty","deep neural network","Lidar 3D vehicle detection","autonomous car","public roads","object detection module","prediction confidence","deep learning","3D vehicle detector","Lidar point clouds","probabilistic detector","reliable epistemic uncertainty","aleatoric uncertainty","detection accuracy","vehicle distance","occlusion","detection performance","safe autonomous driving","object detectors"]}],"abstract":"To assure that an autonomous car is driving safely on public roads, its object detection module should not only work correctly, but show its prediction confidence as well. Previous object detectors driven by deep learning do not explicitly model uncertainties in the neural network. We tackle with this problem by presenting practical methods to capture uncertainties in a 3D vehicle detector for Lidar point clouds. The proposed probabilistic detector represents reliable epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty in classification and localization tasks. Experimental results show that the epistemic uncertainty is related to the detection accuracy, whereas the aleatoric uncertainty is influenced by vehicle distance and occlusion. The results also show that we can improve the detection performance by 1%-5% by modeling the aleatoric uncertainty.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569814","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569814.pdf","startPage":"3266","endPage":"3273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Safe Autonomous Driving: Capture Uncertainty in the Deep Neural Network For Lidar 3D Vehicle Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Towards Safe Autonomous Driving: Capture Uncertainty in the Deep Neural Network For Lidar 3D Vehicle Detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569814/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18308672","htmlLink":"/document/8569814/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Safe Autonomous Driving: Capture Uncertainty in the Deep Neural Network For Lidar 3D Vehicle Detection","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094641S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8569818,"authors":[{"name":"Banafsheh Rekabdar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale"],"firstName":"Banafsheh","lastName":"Rekabdar","id":"37085636382"},{"name":"Christos Mousas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Mousas","id":"38488573700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569818","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569818","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Cameras","Automobiles","Feature extraction","Videos","Roads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","human-robot interaction","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dilated convolutional neural network","predicting driver","human activities","human-robot interaction scenario","smart system","process sequential/temporal observations","long temporal dependencies","deep learning model architecture","real-world scenarios","car","inside camera","outside camera","video frames","deep convolutional structures"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569818","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569818.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","startPage":"3245","endPage":"3250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dilated Convolutional Neural Network for Predicting Driver's Activity","abstract":"Anticipation and prediction play a pivotal role in human-like perception and memory. Anticipating human activities is an essential capability for any natural and seamless human-robot interaction scenario. To effectively understand and reason about human activities, a smart system needs to have the ability to process sequential/temporal observations that are normally noisy, high dimensional, have long temporal dependencies and have a high frequency (e.g, videos). In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model architecture to classify driver's actions and activities in real-world scenarios of driving a car in different conditions. Sensory data comes from a variety of sources including a driver facing camera (inside camera), a road facing camera (outside camera), GPS and other car related sensors. The proposed model is flexible and easy to use since it is not relied on external methods to extract key-points from video frames. It uses convolution and max-pooling pairs to understand spatial relationships within video frames and incorporates dilated deep convolutional structures to capture long temporal dependencies, process and predict driver's activities. We show the results to compete with the state of the art in this domain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569818/","accessionNumber":"18309000","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8569818/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dilated Convolutional Neural Network for Predicting Driver's Activity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dilated Convolutional Neural Network for Predicting Driver's Activity","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081108S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8569822,"authors":[{"name":"Malte Oeljeklaus","affiliation":["Institute of Control Theory and Systems Engineering, TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Malte","lastName":"Oeljeklaus","id":"37086019562"},{"name":"Frank Hoffmann","affiliation":["Institute of Control Theory and Systems Engineering, TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Hoffmann","id":"37275652500"},{"name":"Torsten Bertram","affiliation":["Institute of Control Theory and Systems Engineering, TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Torsten","lastName":"Bertram","id":"37325989700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569822","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":547},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Computer architecture","Task analysis","Three-dimensional displays","Roads","Computational modeling","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","computer vision","embedded systems","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image segmentation","object detection","road traffic","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D bounding box estimation","vehicles surroundings","traffic scene understanding","spatial understanding","fast multitask CNN","spatial information","basic environment model","low cost embedded systems","object detection","road segmentation","shared encoder stage","convolutional neural network","camera based environment perception","lane layout","drivable terrain","traffic scenes","complementary representations","automotive environment models","comprehensive environment model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer Vision","Convolutional Neural Networks","Multi-Task Learning","Semantic Segmentation","Object Detection","3D Reconstruction"]}],"abstract":"Traffic scene understanding involves the perception and accurate representation of a vehicles surroundings within a comprehensive environment model. Generally, automotive environment models incorporate multiple different and complementary representations each focusing on specific aspects of traffic scenes such as the drivable terrain, dynamic objects, the lane layout, etc. Considering camera based environment perception, multi-task models offer an efficient approach capable of generating complementary representations in an integrated manner. Towards this objective, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) comprised of a shared encoder stage and specific decoders for road segmentation and object detection. In comparison to exclusive models for each separate task, the redundant computation of common feature maps is avoided resulting in fast inference times even on low cost embedded systems. Furthermore, the detection stage is extended to predict the orientation of detected objects. The orientation estimate guides a consecutive 3D bounding box estimation based on analytic geometry. Thus, the CNN suffices to generate a basic environment model consisting of the spatial information of dynamic objects as well as the free space area obtained from road segmentation.","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569822.pdf","startPage":"2825","endPage":"2830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Multi-Task CNN for Spatial Understanding of Traffic Scenes","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569822","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Multi-Task CNN for Spatial Understanding of Traffic Scenes","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18308868","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8569822/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Multi-Task CNN for Spatial Understanding of Traffic Scenes","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0652.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096775S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8569869,"authors":[{"name":"Jonas Lundberg","affiliation":["Dept. of Science and Technology, Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"Lundberg","id":"38155441100"},{"name":"Karliohan Lundin Palmerius","affiliation":["Dept. of Science and Technology, Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Karliohan Lundin","lastName":"Palmerius","id":"37297543300"},{"name":"Billy Josefsson","affiliation":["LFV Air Navigation Services of Sweden, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Billy","lastName":"Josefsson","id":"37085945363"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4112-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4113-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7209"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2155-7195"}],"articleNumber":"8569869","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":476},"abstract":"Drone-based services in cities will most likely result in high traffic densities (especially during peak hours).

This paper presents sampled side-effects of using basic unmanned traffic management interventions in an airspace with autonomous point-to-point drone traffic. The samples are based on an interactive simulation and consists of statistics and synthetic images of the simulated situations.

Therefore, tracking and detection algorithms must cooperate with each other to achieve smooth tracking of detected objects that later can be used by the navigation system. In this paper, we first present an efficient multi-sensor fusion approach based on the probabilistic data association method in order to achieve accurate object detection and tracking results. The proposed approach fuses the detection results obtained independently from four main sensors: radar, LiDAR, RGB camera and infrared camera. It generates object region proposals based on the fused detection result. Then, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach is used to identify the object categories within these regions. The CNN is trained on a real dataset from different ferry driving scenarios. The experimental results of tracking and classification on real datasets show that the proposed approach provides reliable object detection and classification results in maritime environments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Sensor fusion","Cameras","Feature extraction","Radar","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural

maneuver in normal situations, and this will make it difficult for a driver to constantly keep his/her concentration on the driving task. On the other hand, until fully autonomous driving becomes a reality, human drivers will still be required to continuously monitor an autonomous system and be able to immediately take over the driving task if necessary (e.g., during a system failure). This study's simulator-based experiments investigate the relationship between a driver's emergency behaviors and the information displayed to the driver. In the experiment, the subject participates in simulated autonomous driving where his/her vehicle runs in the center lane of a three-lane highway in a low-visibility (fog) situation. After a 7- to 8-minute drive, the subject encounters an emergency situation where an obstacle vehicle with flashing hazard lamps appears in front of the subject's vehicle. In this situation, only a simple warning sign and an alarm sound are displayed to half of the experiment's subjects. To the remaining haif, directive visual information (an arrow sign) to indicate the steering direction was displayed on a HUD (head-up display) area in addition to the warning sign and alarm sound. The experimental results suggest a strong ability of the directive information to change the driver's behavior in emergency situations.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569892","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569892.pdf","startPage":"1344","endPage":"1349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Directive Visual Information on Driver's Emergency Behavior","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Directive Visual Information on Driver's Emergency Behavior","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8569892/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18309010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569892/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Directive Visual Information on Driver's Emergency Behavior","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129247S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8569904,"authors":[{"name":"Huazhen Yu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huazhen","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086546245"},{"name":"Youneng Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Youneng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086545584"},{"name":"Mingzhu Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mingzhu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086547643"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569904","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569904","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Resistance","Brakes","Particle swarm optimization","Vehicle dynamics","Data models","Safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brakes","braking","locomotives","particle swarm optimisation","railways","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heavy haul train","intelligent operating strategy","particle swarm optimization","train marshalling data","braking","ShuoHuang railway"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569904","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569904.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","startPage":"2735","endPage":"2740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on Operating Strategy Based on Particle Swarm Optimization for Heavy Haul Train on Long Down-Slope","abstract":"In this paper, aiming at the difficult problem that it is necessary to choose the braking and releasing opportunity rightly when heavy haul train is controlled by cyclic braking method on long down-slope, the running process and control requirements of heavy haul train are analyzed, and the intelligent operating strategy based on particle swarm optimization is proposed.

As a consequence, models and rule-based systems for fault detection become more complex and require more extensive implementation effort and expert knowledge not only within but also across several domains. Besides, vehicles produce rich amounts of data including valuable information for fault detection. These amounts cannot fully be considered by current fault detection approaches. Deep neural networks offer promising capabilities to address these challenges by allowing automated model generation for fault detection without extensive domain knowledge using vast amounts of in-vehicle data. Hence, in this work a data-driven automotive diagnostics approach to fault detection with deep neural networks is proposed in two steps. First, a novel data-driven diagnostics process to learn data-driven algorithms on in-vehicle data is presented. Second, as a key element of this process, a novel fault detection model is proposed using a combination of convolutional and long short-term memory neural networks. To demonstrate the suitability for fault detection, the model is evaluated on internal engine control unit signals for pre-ignition detection in high-pressure turbocharged petrol engines. A classical machine learning processing pipeline and each neural network type separately are used as baselines for a performance comparison. Results show that the proposed model is a promising approach to data-driven automotive diagnostics outperforming all implemented baselines.","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569908.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pre-ignition Detection Using Deep Neural Networks: A Step Towards Data-driven Automotive Diagnostics","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569908","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Pre-ignition Detection Using Deep Neural Networks: A Step Towards Data-driven Automotive Diagnostics","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18308842","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8569908/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pre-ignition Detection Using Deep Neural Networks: A Step Towards Data-driven Automotive Diagnostics","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099389S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8569911,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Bijelic","affiliation":["Daimler AG, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Bijelic","id":"37086488671"},{"name":"Christian Muench","affiliation":["Daimler AG, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Muench","id":"37086547277"},{"name":"Werner Ritter","affiliation":["Daimler AG, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Werner","lastName":"Ritter","id":"37283474100"},{"name":"Yuri Kalnishkan","affiliation":["Royal Holloway, Egham, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Yuri","lastName":"Kalnishkan","id":"37085746263"},{"name":"Klaus Dietmayer","affiliation":["University Ulm, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Dietmayer","id":"37283417900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569911","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569911","abstract":"Adverse weather conditions are extremely challenging for autonomous driving as most state-of-the-art sensors do not function reliably under such circumstances. One method to increase the detection performance is to fuse the raw data signal with neural networks that learn robust features from multiple inputs. Nevertheless noise due to adverse weather is complex, and in addition, automotive sensors fail asymmetrically. Neural networks that perform feature level sensor fusion can be particularly vulnerable if one sensor is corrupted by noise outside the training data distribution compared to decision level fusion. The reason for this is that no built-in mathematical mechanism prevents noise in one sensor channel from corrupting the overall network even though other sensor channels may provide high-quality data. We propose a simple data augmentation scheme that shows a neural network may be able to ignore data from underperforming sensors even though it has never seen that data during training. One can summarize this as a learned \u201cOR\u201d operation at fusion stage. This learned operation is also generally applicable to other noise-types not present during training.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569911","startPage":"2177","endPage":"2184","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569911.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robustness Against Unknown Noise for Raw Data Fusing Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Training","Laser radar","Cameras","Sensor fusion","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data distribution","data augmentation scheme","data fusing neural networks","data signal","mathematical mechanism","OR operation","noise-types","sensor channel","decision level fusion","feature level sensor fusion","automotive sensors","robust features","detection performance","autonomous driving","adverse weather conditions","unknown noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Robustness Against Unknown Noise for Raw Data Fusing Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8569911/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18308966","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness Against Unknown Noise for Raw Data Fusing Neural Networks","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097767S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8569913,"authors":[{"name":"Boyang Wang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Boyang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086487331"},{"name":"Jianwei Gong","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Gong","id":"37290570400"},{"name":"Ruizeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruizeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086545844"},{"name":"Huiyan Chen","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huiyan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37311376200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569913","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"abstract":"Developing an intelligent vehicle which can perform human-like actions requires the ability to learn basic driving skills from a large amount of naturalistic driving data. The algorithms will become efficient if we could decompose the complex driving tasks into motion primitives which represent the elementary compositions of driving skills. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to segment unlabeled trajectory data into a library of motion primitives. By applying a probabilistic inference based on an iterative Expectation-Maximization algorithm, our method segments the collected trajectories while learning a set of motion primitives represented by the dynamic movement primitives. The proposed method utilizes the mutual dependencies between the segmentation and representation of motion primitives and the driving-specific based initial segmentation. By utilizing this mutual dependency and the initial condition, this paper presents how we can enhance the performance of both the segmentation and the motion primitive library establishment. We also evaluate the applicability of the primitive representation method to imitation learning and motion planning algorithms. The model is trained and validated by using the driving data collected from the Beijing Institute of Technology intelligent vehicle platform. The results show that the proposed approach can find the proper segmentation and establish the motion primitive library simultaneously.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion

First, based on the specific properties of aircraft engines time series data, a sliding time window is introduced to sample the historical data to obtain the input vector. Then, the extreme learning machine is utilized to model the relation between time series data and RUL.

In order to handle many of these responsibilities, vehicles need to understand their environment and adjust their behavior according to it. An important aspect of the vehicle environment is the layout of the road segment right ahead of the vehicle, such as the presence and type of an intersection, as it defines the scenario, provides context information and constrains the future motion of traffic participants. The knowledge of upcoming intersections can help to improve various aspects in the context of driver assistance systems and automated driving, such as the prediction of traffic participants or the adjustment of a system with respect to the current scenario. The contribution of this paper is threefold: First, it introduces a model for intersection identification and classification ahead of a vehicle solely from on-board sensor data via deep learning. Second, it proposes a transfer-learning technique allowing to train with fewer samples and showing that intermediate features from path prediction are also beneficial for intersection classification tasks. Third, it allows to reduce necessary computational power since feature extraction is partially shared between the path prediction and the intersection classification model.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569916","startPage":"683","endPage":"690","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569916.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classifying Road Intersections using Transfer-Learning on a Deep Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569916/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classifying Road Intersections using Transfer-Learning on a Deep Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8569916/","accessionNumber":"18308693","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classifying Road Intersections using Transfer-Learning on a Deep Neural Network","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090452S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8569938,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Alvarez Lopez","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer and Informatics Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Pablo Alvarez","lastName":"Lopez","id":"37086546927"},{"name":"Michael Behrisch","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer and Informatics Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Behrisch","id":"38551542600"},{"name":"Laura Bieker-Walz","firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Bieker-Walz","id":"37086547376"},{"name":"Jakob Erdmann","firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Erdmann","id":"37085678119"},{"name":"Yun-Pang Fl\u00f6tter\u00f6d","firstName":"Yun-Pang","lastName":"Fl\u00f6tter\u00f6d","id":"38554430500"},{"name":"Robert Hilbrich","firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Hilbrich","id":"37973562600"},{"name":"Leonhard L\u00fccken","firstName":"Leonhard","lastName":"L\u00fccken","id":"37086543998"},{"name":"Johannes Rummel","firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Rummel","id":"37088827576"},{"name":"Peter Wagner","firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Wagner","id":"38548839900"},{"name":"Evamarie Wiessner","firstName":"Evamarie","lastName":"Wiessner","id":"37088826968"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569938","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":272,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4362},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tools","Microscopy","Roads","Data models","Urban areas","Vehicle dynamics","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road traffic","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microscopic traffic simulation","traffic research","intermodal traffic solutions","open source traffic simulator SUMO"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569938","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569938.pdf","startPage":"2575","endPage":"2582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microscopic Traffic Simulation using SUMO","abstract":"Microscopic traffic simulation is an invaluable tool for traffic research.

The task of cooperative automation is formulated as a centralized optimization problem taking the whole decision space of all vehicles into account. Considering the uncertainty of the environment, the problem is solved in a receding horizon fashion. Then, we employ the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the centralized optimization in a parallel way, which scales more favorably to large-scale instances. Also, Taylor series is used to linearize nonconvex constraints caused by coupling collision avoidance constraints among interactive vehicles. Simulations with two typical traffic scenes for multiple vehicles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18308880","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8569956/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Optimal Control for Cooperative Automation of Large-scale Connected Vehicles via ADMM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Optimal Control for Cooperative Automation of Large-scale Connected Vehicles via ADMM","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101699S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8569961,"authors":[{"name":"Claudio Ruch","affiliation":["ETH, Institute for Transport Planning and Systems, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Ruch","id":"37085351327"},{"name":"Sebastian H\u00f6rl","affiliation":["ETH, Institute for Transport Planning and Systems, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"H\u00f6rl","id":"37086543198"},{"name":"Emilio Frazzoli","affiliation":["ETH, Institute for Transport Planning and Systems, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Emilio","lastName":"Frazzoli","id":"37283368500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0321-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0322-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0324-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"8569961","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":768},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Public transportation","Adaptation models","Robots","Urban areas","Tools","Autonomous vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital simulation","mobility management (mobile radio)","multi-agent systems","public domain software","software packages","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["open-source software package","taxi traces","dedicated graphical viewer","simulation-based testbed","dynamic demand","static demand","arbitrarily configured AMoD systems","agent-based transportation simulation framework","dedicated analysis tools","city planning viewpoint","on-demand fashion","autonomous mobility-on-demand systems","AMoDeus"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569961","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569961.pdf","startPage":"3639","endPage":"3644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AMoDeus, a Simulation-Based Testbed for Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand Systems","abstract":"In an autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) system, customers are transported by autonomously driving vehicles in an on-demand fashion.

AMoDeus uses an agent-based transportation simulation framework to simulate arbitrarily configured AMoD systems with static or dynamic demand. It includes standard benchmark algorithms, fleet efficiency and service level analysis methods and a dedicated graphical viewer that allows in-depth insights into the system. Together with AMoDeus, we publish a typical simulation scenario based on taxi traces recorded in San Francisco.

By modeling relevant driving scenarios, utilizing simulations and selecting insightful test cases, the testing effort is reduced. However, current methods can't automatically create intuitive models of the vehicle trajectories in a scenario. We propose to use unsupervised machine learning to train neural networks to solve the modeling problem. The models learn a small set of intuitive parameters without the need for labeled data and use them to generate new realistic trajectories. The neural networks, which base on the InfoGAN and beta-VAE architectures, are adapted from the image domain to the time series domain. Although our methods are generally applicable, our experiments focus on lane change maneuvers on highways. To train the networks, we use more than 5600 measured lane change trajectories extracted from the highD dataset. Our results show that the networks learn to describe lane change maneuvers by up to four intuitive parameters. Furthermore, the networks are able to map existing lane change trajectories to values of the learned parameters and generate new, previously unseen, realistic trajectories. We compare both architectures among themselves and to a polynomial model, and show respective advantages.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Mathematical model","Neural networks","Safety","Data models","Road transportation","Gallium nitride"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver information systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","road vehicles","time series","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven maneuver","generative adversarial networks","variational autoencoders","highly automated vehicles","scenario-based validation","highly automated driving systems","relevant driving scenarios","vehicle trajectories","unsupervised machine","neural networks","intuitive parameters","realistic trajectories","beta-VAE architectures","image domain","time series domain","lane change maneuvers","learned parameters","unseen trajectories","polynomial model","measured lane change trajectories"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8569971","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569971","startPage":"2383","endPage":"2390","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569971.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569971","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569971/","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Maneuver Modeling using Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders for Safety Validation of Highly Automated Vehicles","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18308954","htmlLink":"/document/8569971/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Maneuver Modeling using Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders for Safety Validation of Highly Automated Vehicles","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0587.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064944S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8569988,"authors":[{"name":"Karl Kurzer","affiliation":["FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Kurzer","id":"37086488478"},{"name":"Florian Engelhorn","affiliation":["FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Engelhorn","id":"37086542934"},{"name":"J.

Observing the behavior of others, humans infer whether or not others are cooperating. This work aims to extend the capabilities of automated vehicles, enabling them to cooperate implicitly in heterogeneous environments. Continuous actions allow for arbitrary trajectories and hence are applicable to a much wider class of problems than existing cooperative approaches with discrete action spaces. Based on cooperative modeling of other agents, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in conjunction with Decoupled-UCT evaluates the action-values of each agent in a cooperative and decentralized way, respecting the interdependence of actions among traffic participants. The extension to continuous action spaces is addressed by incorporating novel MCTS-specific enhancements for efficient search space exploration. The proposed algorithm is evaluated under different scenarios, showing that the algorithm is able to achieve effective cooperative planning and generate solutions egocentric planning fails to identify.","publicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8543039/8569013/08569988.pdf","startPage":"452","endPage":"459","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8569013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Cooperative Planning for Automated Vehicles with Continuous Monte Carlo Tree Search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8569988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Cooperative Planning for Automated Vehicles with Continuous Monte Carlo Tree Search","htmlLink":"/document/8569988/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18308959","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Cooperative Planning for Automated Vehicles with Continuous Monte Carlo Tree Search","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0878.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067362S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8543039","isNumber":"8569013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8543039","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8569013","articleId":"8569988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"}]
