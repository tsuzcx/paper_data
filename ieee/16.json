It is shown that the two-stage canceller meets the 60-dB echo cancellation accuracy for various typical loops.

Depending on the optimization strategy used, this criterion leads to a variety of fast learning algorithms for single-layered as well as multilayered neural networks. The simplest algorithm devised on the basis of this generalized criterion is the fast delta rule algorithm, proposed for the training of single-layered neural networks. The application of a similar optimization strategy to multilayered neural networks in conjunction with the proposed generalized criterion provides the fast backpropagation algorithm. Another set of fast algorithms with better convergence properties is derived on the basis of the same strategy that provided recently a family of Efficient LEarning Algorithms for Neural NEtworks (ELEANNE). Several experiments verify that the fast algorithms developed perform the training of neural networks faster than the corresponding learning algorithms existing in the literature.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.160170","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00160170.png","startPage":"453","endPage":"474","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/4198/00160170.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.160170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast learning algorithms for neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Signal processing algorithms","Multi-layer neural network","Feedforward neural networks","Convergence","Computer networks","Feedforward systems","Speech","Image recognition","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning algorithms","feedforward neural networks","optimization strategy","multilayered neural networks","delta rule algorithm","single-layered neural networks","backpropagation algorithm","ELEANNE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/160170/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","displayDocTitle":"Fast learning algorithms for neural networks","volume":"39","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4295635","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast learning algorithms for neural networks","sourcePdf":"00160170.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058885S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"4198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"78","articleId":"160170","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":160172,"authors":[{"name":"A.B.

It is proved that the problem of deciding schedulability of a set of concrete periodic tasks is intractable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/REAL.1991.160366","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings Twelfth Real-Time Systems Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings Twelfth Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/380/4202/00160366.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REAL.1991.160366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4202","startPage":"129","endPage":"139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On non-preemptive scheduling of period and sporadic tasks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=160366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On non-preemptive scheduling of period and sporadic tasks","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/160366/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4189156","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On non-preemptive scheduling of period and sporadic tasks","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00160366.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073933S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec 1991","isNumber":"4202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"380","citationCount":"207","articleId":"160366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":160369,"authors":[{"name":"T.-W.

The schedulability of adjustable periodic processes by a preemptive fixed priority scheduler is formulated in terms of a configuration selection problem. Specifically, two process transformations are introduced for the purpose of deriving a bound for the achievable utilization factor of processes whose periods are related by harmonics. This result is then generalized so that the bound is applicable to any process set and an efficient algorithm to calculate the bound is provided. When the list of allowable configurations is implicitly given by a set of scalable periodic processes, the corresponding period assignment problem is shown to be NP-complete. The authors present an approximation algorithm for the period assignment problem for which some encouraging experimental results are included.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel2/380/4202/00160369.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"170","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings Twelfth Real-Time Systems Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REAL.1991.160369","doi":"10.1109/REAL.1991.160369","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings Twelfth Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=160369","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Real time systems","Radar tracking","Vehicles","Approximation algorithms","Timing","Processor scheduling","Resource management","Frequency","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","programming theory","real-time systems","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive real-time systems","timing parameters","schedulability","adjustable periodic processes","preemptive fixed priority scheduler","configuration selection problem","process transformations","utilization factor","harmonics","process set","period assignment problem","NP-complete","approximation algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/160369/","displayDocTitle":"Load adjustment in adaptive real-time systems","accessionNumber":"4189159","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 1991","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load adjustment in adaptive real-time systems","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00160369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027656S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec 1991","isNumber":"4202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"380","citationCount":"110","articleId":"160369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":160372,"authors":[{"name":"C.D.

Multilevel classification involves using up to five discrete nonlinear levels that correspond to human assessment. The system software was developed using both Microsoft C and Think C. The result of the multilevel test using a vowel subset achieved 61.8% recognition, and it achieved an average classification of good. The consonant test achieved recognition of 46.5% and 48% for the vowels /a/ and /e/, respectively.

Such a strategy can lead to misdirecting residuals in adjacent valid measurements when the modeled transformer setting is incorrect. Ultimately, a network solution is derived which does not match actual real-time conditions. A new transformer tap estimation technique is presented which incorporates the function directly into the state estimation algorithm. The procedure provides for turns ratio and phase angle measurements and treats each transformer tap setting as an independent state variable. Test results for an actual 300-bus network demonstrate the tap estimation capability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PICA.1991.160611","startPage":"416","endPage":"422","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] Conference Papers 1991 Power Industry Computer Application Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/513/4205/00160611.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] Conference Papers 1991 Power Industry Computer Application Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICA.1991.160611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State estimation of voltage and phase-shift transformer tap settings","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["State estimation","Phase transformers","Power system modeling","Voltage transformers","Phase measurement","Power system security","IEEE members","Position measurement","Telemetry","Goniometers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase shifters","potential transformers","power system analysis computing","power transformers","real-time systems","state estimation","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system analysis computing","modelling","state estimation algorithms","transformer tap setting","voltage transformer","turns ratio","phase-shift transformer angle","real-time","state variable"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/160611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 May 1991","displayDocTitle":"State estimation of voltage and phase-shift transformer tap settings","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-10 May 1991","accessionNumber":"4188602","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State estimation of voltage and phase-shift transformer tap settings","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00160611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027445S","chronDate":"7-10 May 1991","isNumber":"4205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"513","citationCount":"4","articleId":"160611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":160677,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the example transmit filter, after the usual analog reconstruction filter is modified to place its steep rolloff where it will ease the requirements on the FIR filter, the latter can then be designed so that the combined spectral response of the analog and FIR filters will be root Nyquist, meet a regulatory mask, and minimize interference with adjacent channels. The choice of a transmit-filter phase response is based on the resulting peak transmit-power requirement.

Resulting from precisely controlled molecular-beam-epitaxy growth and elaborate fabrication processes, the HBTs were endowed with large h/sub FE/, f/sub T/, and f/sub max/ of 50, 50 GHz, and 90 GHz, respectively, under the standard operation bias point in the circuit.

Departures from ideal quasi-phase matching in periodicity, wavelength, angle of propagation, and temperature are examined to determine the tuning properties and acceptance bandwidths for second-harmonic generation in periodic structures. Numerical examples are tabulated for periodically poled lithium niobate. Various types of errors in the periodicity of these structures are then analyzed to find their effects on the conversion efficiency and on the shape of the tuning curve. This analysis is useful for establishing fabrication tolerances for practical quasi-phase-matched devices. A method of designing structures having desired phase-matching tuning curve shapes is also described. The method makes use of varying domain lengths to establish a varying effective nonlinear coefficient along the interaction length.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/161322/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","volume":"28","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"4306245","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-phase-matched second harmonic generation: tuning and tolerances","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-phase-matched second harmonic generation: tuning and tolerances","sourcePdf":"00161322.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11061S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"1561","articleId":"161322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":161335,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This filter estimates the deterministic component of the signal and removes the noise uncorrelated with the stimulus, even if this noise is colored, as in the case of evoked potentials. The filter needs two inputs: the signal (primary input) and an impulse correlated with the deterministic component (reference input). The LMS algorithm is used to adjust the weights in the adaptive process. It is shown that the AICF is equivalent to exponentially weighted averaging (FWA) when using the LMS algorithm. A quantitative analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio improvement, convergence, and misadjustment error is presented. A comparison of the AICF with ensemble averaging (EA) and moving window averaging (MWA) techniques is also presented.

An alternative formulation of the local motion assumption in which there may be two distinct patterns undergoing coherent (e.g. affine) motion within a given local analysis region is proposed. An algorithm for the analysis of two-component motion in which tracking and nulling mechanisms applied to three consecutive image frames separate and estimate the individual components is given. Precise results are obtained, even for components that differ only slightly in velocity as well as for a faint component in the presence of a dominant, masking component. The algorithm provides precise motion estimates for a set of elementary two-motion configurations and is robust in the presence of noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4217","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/4217/00161348.pdf","doi":"10.1109/34.161348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.161348","startPage":"886","endPage":"896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A three-frame algorithm for estimating two-component image motion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/161348/","displayDocTitle":"A three-frame algorithm for estimating two-component image motion","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4272221","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A three-frame algorithm for estimating two-component image motion","sourcePdf":"00161348.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046639S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"183","articleId":"161348","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":161350,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The formulation involves the specification of a deterministic structural model along with stochastic observation and motion field models. Two motion models are proposed: a globally smooth model based on vector Markov random fields and a piecewise smooth model derived from coupled vector-binary Markov random fields. Two estimation criteria are studied. In the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation, the a posteriori probability of motion given data is maximized, whereas in the minimum expected cost (MEC) estimation, the expectation of a certain cost function is minimized. Both algorithms generate sample fields by means of stochastic relaxation implemented via the Gibbs sampler. Two versions are developed: one for a discrete state space and the other for a continuous state space. The MAP estimation is incorporated into a hierarchical environment to deal efficiently with large displacements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.161350","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/4217/00161350.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.161350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4217","startPage":"910","endPage":"927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian estimation of motion vector fields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=161350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian estimation of motion vector fields","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/161350/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4272223","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian estimation of motion vector fields","sourcePdf":"00161350.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047703S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"218","articleId":"161350","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":161355,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.

Some simulation and experimental results and a mathematical performance analysis are presented to demonstrate the superior tracking performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.161468","startPage":"369","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/4220/00161468.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.161468","endPage":"378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A resolver-to-digital conversion method for fast tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/161468/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"A resolver-to-digital conversion method for fast tracking","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4305321","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A resolver-to-digital conversion method for fast tracking","sourcePdf":"00161468.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024842S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"79","articleId":"161468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":161471,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

A monitoring technique combining the open-circuit voltage and the coulometric measurements had been previously implemented on a microcomputer-based circuit. This adaptive monitoring technique enables the monitor to adjust to different battery sizes as well as the aging process. Several improvements are reported. A technique has been developed to enhance the acurracy and reduce the required rest period of the open-circuit voltage measurement. The open-circuit voltage recovery curve is approximated by two asymptotes on a semilog scale. The open-circuit voltage is then extrapolated from the slope of the first asymptote before it fully stabilizes. The accuracy of the monitor has been verified in field tests, and comparison with a commercial battery monitor shows it to be superior in several respects.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/161471/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4305324","volume":"39","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A battery state-of-charge indicator for electric wheelchairs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A battery state-of-charge indicator for electric wheelchairs","sourcePdf":"00161471.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038355S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"145","articleId":"161471","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":161472,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Considering only the case when the modulation index is rational, the number of possible encoder states defined by the current amplitude and phase becomes finite, and MACPM can be described as a trellis code. If such MACPM modulator is preceded by a convolutional encoder, a more powerful trellis code is obtained. The Euclidean distance spectrum of coded MACPM, needed for analytic error probability evaluation, is obtained using an efficient bidirectional trellis search (BIFAST).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MELCON.1991.161907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MELCON.1991.161907","startPage":"590","endPage":"593 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 6th Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/522/4225/00161907.pdf","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 6th Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distance spectrum of coded multi-amplitude CPM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Distance spectrum of coded multi-amplitude CPM","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 1991","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4193920","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/161907/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distance spectrum of coded multi-amplitude CPM","confLoc":"LJubljana, Slovenia","sourcePdf":"00161907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033049S","chronDate":"22-24 May 1991","isNumber":"4225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"522","citationCount":"1","articleId":"161907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":161908,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.

In order for the VA to perform MLSE, it is necessary to supply the algorithm with an estimate of the impulse response of the transmission path. One way to achieve this is to utilize an adaptive channel identifier which must be trained periodically throughout transmission. In the proposed GSM Viterbi equalizers, the channel estimate is made at the center of the data block and then held constant throughout the entire message sequence. Due to the highly time-variant nature of the medium, the impulse response of the channel may, however, be subject to significant variation within one block period, resulting in estimation error and degraded equalizer performance. The ways in which identification inaccuracies affect the performance of the VA are considered. Theoretical expressions for expected channel impulse response (CIR) estimate error in the stationary and time-variant situations are derived. The use of adaptive algorithms to continuously estimate update throughout information transmission is also investigated. The theoretical performance bounds of these techniques are derived and validated by computer simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"ICC 91 International Conference on Communications Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel2/541/4226/00162329.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"27 vol.1","publicationTitle":"ICC 91 International Conference on Communications Conference Record","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1991.162329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1991.162329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4226","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=162329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive channel identification and equalisation for GSM European digital mobile radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive equalizers","GSM","Maximum likelihood estimation","Viterbi algorithm","Land mobile radio","Estimation error","Degradation","Computer errors","Adaptive algorithm","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","digital radio systems","equalisers","parameter estimation","signal processing","telecommunication channels","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Groupe Speciale Mobile","signal processing","GSM European digital mobile radio","maximum likelihood sequence estimation","MLSE","Viterbi algorithm","transmission path","adaptive channel identifier","GSM Viterbi equalizers","channel estimate","message sequence","block period","estimation error","degraded equalizer performance","identification inaccuracies","channel impulse response","time-variant situations","adaptive algorithms","performance bounds"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/162329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive channel identification and equalisation for GSM European digital mobile radio","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4213669","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive channel identification and equalisation for GSM European digital mobile radio","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00162329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061311S","chronDate":"23-26 Jun 1991","isNumber":"4226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"541","citationCount":"9","articleId":"162329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":162350,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A 3/4-rate coding and a 4-state, simple convolutional encoder is considered. The bandlimited signal is distorted by a nonlinear amplifier on board the satellite which introduces AM-AM and AM-PM conversions. Additive white Gaussian noise is assumed to be added to the signal on both up and down links. Bit error rates are computed for uncoded 8-ary coherent phase-shift keying (CPSK) and trellis coded 16-ary QAM transmissions as a function of up and down link carrier-to-noise ratios. A raised cosine filter with a roll-off factor of alpha =0.4 equally split between the transmitter and the receiver, giving a spectral efficiency of 2.14 b/s/Hz, is assumed. It is shown that as output backoff is increased, coding gain is also increased and can reach a value of over 3 dB.

The results show that if applied properly, IS can be useful in ATM system analysis; typically, the computational burden can be reduced by more than three orders of magnitude.

The performance is presented as the probability of error as a function of signal-to-noise ratio for a given number of active transmitters. The particular examples use the measured multipath characteristics from five manufacturing areas and the bandwidth assigned by the FCC. Performance calculations based on actual channel measurements show little difference when no external diversity is used. Maximal-ratio combining with two orders of external diversity increases the performance.

It is found that the optimal detector uses a decoding metric which is a quadratic form of Gaussian variates.

Subsequently, it is found that multiple-symbol differential detection is a very effective strategy for eliminating the irreducible error floor commonly associated with conventional differential detection.

The authors describe results from using neural networks for call admission control and switch control. The call control problem is the selective admission of a set of calls from a number of inhomogeneous call classes, which may have widely differing characteristics. The approach adopted is that key network performance parameters are observed while carrying various combinations of calls, and their relationship is learned by a neural network structure. The neural network model chosen has the ability to learn from past results and to adapt to changing conditions. The switch control problem is the service policy used by a switch controller in transmitting messages. In a crossbar switch with input queuing, significant loss of throughput can occur when head-of-line service is employed. Various alternatives to first in, first out (FIFO) input queuing are examined and their performances are compared.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jun 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/162443/","accessionNumber":"4208423","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks in communications: admission control and switch control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks in communications: admission control and switch control","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00162443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078692S","chronDate":"23-26 Jun 1991","isNumber":"4226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"541","citationCount":"16","articleId":"162443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":162455,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The proposed converter features a constant current source output characteristic while utilizing all component parasitics. The converter is based on a half-bridge topology with zero voltage switching (ZVS) characteristics, feeding an isolation transformer and output rectifiers. The converter's resonant action is based on the leakage inductance of the isolation transformer and the output rectifier capacitance. This output side resonance resets the energy normally dissipated in the Schottky capacitance and also enables a buck-boost condition for the output voltage. The converter demonstrates current source output characteristics which are applied to a battery charging application. Coaxial winding techniques for the isolation transformer are also investigated. These winding characteristics are shown to be unique and favorable when applied to DC-to-DC converters and especially the dual resonant converter topology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"PESC '91 Record 22nd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/568/4228/00162677.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"PESC '91 Record 22nd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1991.162677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1991.162677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4228","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=162677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A ZVS dual resonant converter for battery charging applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Zero voltage switching","Resonance","Batteries","DC-DC power converters","Topology","Rectifiers","Switching converters","Inductance","Parasitic capacitance","Coaxial components"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery chargers","power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coaxial winding","dual resonant converter","battery charging","load side resonant","high power density","DC-to-DC converter","constant current source","half-bridge topology","zero voltage switching","isolation transformer","output rectifiers","leakage inductance","output rectifier capacitance","buck-boost condition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/162677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"A ZVS dual resonant converter for battery charging applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4213844","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A ZVS dual resonant converter for battery charging applications","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00162677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030023S","chronDate":"24-27 Jun 1991","isNumber":"4228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"568","citationCount":"9","articleId":"162677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":162683,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

The PRDCL provides variable link pulse position as well as variable link pulse width, which is a quite different feature from the other resonant DC-links, and thus the PWM capability can be increased. The SPSS technique is adopted for further enhancement of PWM capability. Moderate combination of two soft switching operations enables the conventional space vector PWM technique to be used. Due to distinctive advantages, including true PWM capability, minimum device voltage stresses, and reasonable additional device count, the proposed converter can be operated in a wide power range (20-200 kW). Operational principles, analyses, and the realization of a space vector PWM of the proposed converter are presented.

There, the third phase is clamped to the positive or negative DC link voltage. This method is called discontinuous modulation, due to the discontinuous shape of the generating phase modulation functions. As a closer analysis shows, the discontinuous method allows an increase in the effective system pulse frequency, dependent on the phase angle between converter output voltage and output current. The basis for a comparison with the continuous method is chosen as equal average switching losses of any converter bridge leg. For harmonic-optimal operation one must change between continuous and discontinuous modulation (or between various variants of the discontinuous modulation), depending on the load status. The harmonic losses of the control methods are calculated directly in the time domain. For this purpose, the space vector calculus is applied and approximations are used which are sufficiently exact for PWM converter systems with high pulse frequency.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1991.162702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1991.162702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4228","startPage":"372","endPage":"381","displayPublicationTitle":"PESC '91 Record 22nd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/568/4228/00162702.pdf","publicationTitle":"PESC '91 Record 22nd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=162702","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Voltage","Pulse width modulation converters","Switching converters","Bridge circuits","Leg","Phase modulation","Frequency conversion","Shape","Switching loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonics","power convertors","pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3-phase PWM convertor system","harmonics RMS value","discontinuous modulation","voltage space vector","DC link voltage","generating phase modulation functions","pulse frequency","output voltage","output current","switching losses","harmonic-optimal operation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing the current harmonics RMS value of three-phase PWM converter systems by optimal and suboptimal transition between continuous and discontinuous modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Jun 1991","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 June 1991","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4208457","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/162702/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing the current harmonics RMS value of three-phase PWM converter systems by optimal and suboptimal transition between continuous and discontinuous modulation","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00162702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034799S","chronDate":"24-27 Jun 1991","isNumber":"4228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"568","citationCount":"50","articleId":"162702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":162703,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A control strategy is presented to selectively cancel the generated lower order abnormal harmonics at the output and input terminals and thereby preserve the high-performance features of a PWM AC-DC converter. The proposed technique essentially involves computing the sequence components of the unbalanced input supply and suitably counter unbalances the PWM gating signals of the converter switches to cancel the generated abnormal harmonics. The technique is essentially a feedforward approach and is suitable for higher-power GTO-type PWM AC-DC converters. A procedure for implementing this technique in real time is discussed.

Due to this fact, both the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) and the zero-current switched quasi-resonant (ZCS-QR) SEPIC used as PFPs are studied. Stress in components and operation in continuous and discontinuous conduction mode are considered in the PWM case, while the use of full-wave and half-wave resonant switches is considered in the ZCS-QR case. The study of the PWM SEPIC used as a PFP reveals that both types of PFP control, multiplier approach and voltage-follower approach, can be used in PWM SEPIC, the first one when it operates in continuous conduction mode and the second one when it operates in discontinuous conduction mode. Regarding the ZCS-QR SEPIC used as PFP, both types of resonant switch (half-wave and full-wave) can be used.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"PESC '91 Record 22nd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/568/4228/00162764.pdf","startPage":"780","endPage":"791","publicationTitle":"PESC '91 Record 22nd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1991.162764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1991.162764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4228","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=162764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving power factor correction in distributed power supply systems using PWM and ZCS-QR SEPIC topologies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power factor correction","Power supplies","Pulse width modulation","Switches","Resonance","Inductance","Topology","Reactive power","Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulsed power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductance","power factor correction","power supplies to apparatus","pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi-resonant converter","continuous conduction","power factor correction","distributed power supply systems","PWM","single-ended primary inductance converter","power factor preregulator","pulsewidth modulation","zero-current switched","discontinuous conduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/162764/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"Improving power factor correction in distributed power supply systems using PWM and ZCS-QR SEPIC topologies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4213895","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving power factor correction in distributed power supply systems using PWM and ZCS-QR SEPIC topologies","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00162764.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034486S","chronDate":"24-27 Jun 1991","isNumber":"4228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"568","citationCount":"80","articleId":"162764","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":162859,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

With improper source/drain doping strategies a resistive Schottky diode characteristic may result, providing severely limited gate drive. This effect can be modeled in PISCES-2B. Comparisons between hardware and simulation on salicided and nonsalicided devices are presented along with a variety of source/drain designs intended to avoid the formation of this device series resistance component. Analysis of the simulations indicated that the series resistance is caused by current crowding at the source edge, since the Schottky diode is reverse-biased and unable to participate in electron injection.

Accordingly, detection and interpretation of these are complicated by the fact that detection and classification cannot be made on the basis of temporal snapshots alone.

The neutral network is trained to analyze fixed time frames of the input signal to detect the presence or absence of the target, during which the network gets adapted to the local environment and learns to identify the features of the targets. A multilayer neural network is trained to correctly classify many example patterns with and without the target signal present. The back propagation learning rule is employed to update the weights on every presentation of input frames. Once the training is complete the network would be able to tell whether the input frame presented to it contains any target signature.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/163331/","accessionNumber":"4208915","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural network for underwater target detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network for underwater target detection","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00163331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027314S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug 1991","isNumber":"4233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"596","citationCount":"1","articleId":"163331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":163332,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Three generic systems are considered. The first is a conventional system that uses a quadratic Bayesian (QB) classifier. Next is a hybrid approach that uses a neural compound classifier network (CCN) of the type proposed by B.G. Batchelor (1974). Both the conventional and hybrid approaches use a generic automatic detector given by J.J. Wolcin (1984), which is structured to detect signals of arbitrary duration and frequency content.

It is shown that the training period is dominated by the time required to stabilize the bias weight. This weight is analogous to an adaptive threshold and is related directly to the network false alarm probability. A second issue addressed is the steady-state performance of the network.

These bounds extend the meaning of near-field distances or diffraction lengths to the situation where the array driving functions can be broad-bandwidth signals. Particular attention is given to transmitting and receiving array systems which consist of elements that are not large in comparison to the shortest wavelength of significance contained in the signals driving them. Their output signals constitute higher-order beams whose coherence properties are degraded more slowly by diffraction than lower-order beams. It is shown that for certain measures of performance involving these beam characteristics, a localized wave pulse-driven array can outperform similar continuous-wave-driven arrays. An array with independent addressable elements is required to realize these localized wave effects. The enhanced localization effects are intimately coupled to the proper spatial distribution of broad-bandwidth signals driving the array.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/4236/00163426.pdf","startPage":"888","endPage":"905","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.163426","doi":"10.1109/8.163426","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=163426","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Beams","Pulse generation","Bandwidth","EMP radiation effects","Frequency","Character generation","Diffraction","Pulse measurements","Maxwell equations","Phased arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmitting array","antenna arrays","electromagnetic beams","ultra-wide bandwidth pulse-driven arrays","near-field distances","diffraction lengths","receiving array","higher-order beams","coherence properties","localized wave pulse-driven array","independent addressable elements","broad-bandwidth signals"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/163426/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"Properties of electromagnetic beams generated by ultra-wide bandwidth pulse-driven arrays","accessionNumber":"4306079","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","volume":"40","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Properties of electromagnetic beams generated by ultra-wide bandwidth pulse-driven arrays","sourcePdf":"00163426.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054456S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"74","articleId":"163426","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":163431,"authors":[{"name":"C.-C.

The generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) is used to evaluate the bearing responses of adaptive arrays with pointing errors. Under the assumption of equispaced linear arrays, the Legendre polynomial is used to derive a closed-form formula for the sidelobe leakage factor, the ratio in which the signal leaks into the GSC sidelobe cancelling branch. Moreover, the effective beamwidth, the maximum range of pointing inaccuracy allowable to keep the signal loss in array output less than a given value, is derived for the GSC with a delay-and-sum quiescent beamformer. Such adaptive arrays can achieve the maximum output signal-to-noise ratio when the presteering is perfect, and the performance is independent of the location of the phase origin.

The CDS signal processing is frequency used to remove noise, which is generated by the reset operation of the floating diffusion charge detection node, from the signal. The derived formulas for the noise power spectral density provide an invaluable insight into the choice of the circuit parameters affecting the noise spectrum. The obtained results are useful for determining the optimum cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter which precedes the sample-and-hold circuit and for finding the optimum size of the input transistor in the first amplifier stage. Once the optimum parameters are determined it is possible to find the minimum electron equivalent noise and the maximum signal-to-noise ratio achievable with this signal processing method.

For the constant-irradiance model of operation it is shown that in order to maintain 90% of the maximum dynamic range and an antiblooming protection of 300*, the smear signal must be less than 0.037%. For the constant integration-time mode of operation, it is shown that in order to maintain 75% of a particular device's maximum dynamic range and the same amount of antiblooming protection the smear signal must be less than 0.0074%. It is also found in this mode that this relationship between antiblooming protection and the amount of linear dynamic range is exponential, and dependent on the antiblooming structure's nonideality factor and the individual photodetector's capacitance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/4237/00163449.pdf","startPage":"2508","endPage":"2514","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.163449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.163449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=163449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effects of smear on antiblooming protection and dynamic range of interline CCD image sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protection","Dynamic range","Charge-coupled image sensors","Capacitance","Charge coupled devices","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Image sensors","Voltage","Photoconductivity","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photodetectors capacitance","image smear","antiblooming protection","dynamic range","interline CCD image sensors","smearing signal","tradeoff","constant-irradiance model of operation","constant integration-time mode of operation","nonideality factor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/163449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"The effects of smear on antiblooming protection and dynamic range of interline CCD image sensors","volume":"39","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4332699","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effects of smear on antiblooming protection and dynamic range of interline CCD image sensors","sourcePdf":"00163449.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025369S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"3","articleId":"163449","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":163459,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In the linear transport regime, the effects of impurity scattering on the quantized conductance of the electron waveguide are studied in detail. The decrease of conductance and the deterioration of quantized steps due to impurity scattering are found to become more conspicuous as the impurity density increases. When the impurity density increases much more, the quantized steps of conductance disappear to approach the conductance values estimated by the classical model. In the nonlinear transport regime at large bias voltage, the current-voltage characteristics of the electron waveguide are studied at T=0 and 300 K. It is found that the conductance of the electron waveguide at low temperature deviates from the quantized value of 2e/sup 2//h as the bias voltage increases. The possibility of the transistor operation of the electron waveguide at room temperature is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.163459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.163459","endPage":"2471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/4237/00163459.pdf","startPage":"2465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum-mechanical simulation of electron waveguides in linear and nonlinear transport regimes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/163459/","displayDocTitle":"Quantum-mechanical simulation of electron waveguides in linear and nonlinear transport regimes","volume":"39","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"4332694","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum-mechanical simulation of electron waveguides in linear and nonlinear transport regimes","sourcePdf":"00163459.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033879S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"11","articleId":"163459","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":163468,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

This discrepancy is seen to increase as pixel-to-pixel crosstalk increases for a given aperture size due to an increase in diffusion length, a decrease in depletion depth, or a decrease in the substrate's absorption (coefficient) and/or as the pixel's aperture decreases with respect to the pixel size.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.163473","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"2621","endPage":"2623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/4237/00163473.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.163473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified model of carrier diffusion and sampling aperture effects on MTF in solid-state image sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Apertures","Image sampling","Solid modeling","Solid state circuits","Image sensors","Charge carriers","Pixel","Convolution","Crosstalk"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","diffusion in solids","image sensors","optical transfer function","semiconductor device models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified model","carrier diffusion","sampling aperture effects","MTF","solid-state image sensors","modulation-transfer function","front-side-illuminated","lateral diffusion","charge carriers","substrate","pixel sampling apertures","pixel-to-pixel crosstalk","depletion depth"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"A unified model of carrier diffusion and sampling aperture effects on MTF in solid-state image sensors","volume":"39","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4338317","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/163473/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified model of carrier diffusion and sampling aperture effects on MTF in solid-state image sensors","sourcePdf":"00163473.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058983S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"17","articleId":"163473","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":163481,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

When the observation interval is increased, the performance of MSK with N-MLBE tends to that of binary coherently detected orthogonal binary frequency shift keying. A new demodulation strategy, reduced block noncoherent estimation (RBNE), is introduced and shown to improve the performance of noncoherent MSK, beyond that of coherently detected orthogonal FSK. When RBNE is used with MSK and the observation interval is increased, the performance approaches that of antipodal signaling. The key feature of all these structures is multisymbol noncoherent processing with exploitation of the MSK inherent coding properties induced by its phase continuity. The use of binary block codes for MSK with N-MLBE is considered.

A detrimental dispersion equation is obtained which implicitly includes beam space-charge effects without recourse to a heuristic model of the space-charge field.

For a given motor, this commutator reduces the peaks and the rates of change of the reference currents. Although primarily intended for lower-speed direct-drive applications, the commutator design allows accurate current tracking, and therefore reduced torque ripple, over a reasonably wide range of operating speeds. Three motor models, (analytical, numerical, and measured) are considered. Issues relating commutation schemes to amplifier requirements are addressed by simulating simple analytical models of the electrical dynamics. To reveal the interplay between motor design and commutator output, torque models produced by numerical field calculations are considered. To demonstrate the practical benefits and limitations of the method, a balanced commutator based on measured motor data is implemented, and torque ripple reduction is quantified in a laboratory experiment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/163641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4307202","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A balanced commutator for switched reluctance motors to reduce torque ripple","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A balanced commutator for switched reluctance motors to reduce torque ripple","sourcePdf":"00163641.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024972S","chronDate":"Oct.  1992","isNumber":"4242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"117","articleId":"163641","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":163644,"authors":[{"name":"T.C.

Two instability mechanisms can typically occur: (1) the current programmed controller effective current feedback loop may become unstable, or (2) the controller effective input voltage feedforward loop, which becomes a positive feedback loop when an input filter is added, may oscillate. Three design criteria for preventing oscillations are derived and interpreted. When all three criteria are well satisfied, then the output voltage regulation loop gain is unchanged. Hence, input filters of current programmed converters can be designed in essentially the same manner as for duty-ratio programmed converters. Results are summarized in tabular form for the basic buck, boost, and buck-boost converters. Experimental measurements for a buck converter with different input filters support the theoretical predictions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/63.163651","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/4242/00163651.pdf","startPage":"725","endPage":"733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.163651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical origins of input filter oscillations in current programmed converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=163651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/163651/","displayDocTitle":"Physical origins of input filter oscillations in current programmed converters","volume":"7","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4307213","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical origins of input filter oscillations in current programmed converters","sourcePdf":"00163651.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037824S","chronDate":"Oct.  1992","isNumber":"4242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"81","articleId":"163651","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":163668,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Archie helps architects in the high-level task of conceptual design as opposed to low-level tasks such as drawing and drafting, numerical calculations, and constraint propagation. Archie goes beyond supporting architects in design proposal and critiquing. It acts as a shared external memory that supports two kinds of design collaboration. First, by including enough knowledge about the goals, plans, outcomes, and lessons of past cases, it lets the designer access the work of previous architects. Second, by providing access to the perspectives of domain experts via the domain models, Archie helps architects anticipate and accommodate experts' views on evolving designs. The lessons learned about building large case-based systems to support real-world decision making in developing Archie are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/163668/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1992","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4313214","volume":"7","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Case-based design support: a case study in architectural design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Case-based design support: a case study in architectural design","sourcePdf":"00163668.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131547S","chronDate":"Oct.  1992","isNumber":"4243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"64","citationCount":"74","articleId":"163668","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":163672,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Complete information about a freespace and goal is encoded in the form of a special artificial potential function, called a navigation function, that connects the kinematic planning problem with the dynamic execution problem in a provably correct fashion. The navigation function automatically gives rise to a bounded-torque feedback controller for the robot's actuators that guarantees collision-free motion and convergence to the destination from almost all initial free configurations. A formula for navigation functions that guide a point-mass robot in a generalized sphere world is developed. The simplest member of this family is a space obtained by puncturing a disk by an arbitrary number of smaller disjoint disks representing obstacles. The other spaces are obtained from this model by a suitable coordinate transformation.

Path planning finds for the robots geometric paths to avoid collision with static obstacles and trajectory planning determines how fast each robot must move along its geometric path to avoid collision with other moving robots. For a dual-robot system, a simple trajectory planning strategy is to let each robot move along its path as fast as possible and delay one robot at its initial position to avoid collision with the other robot. A sufficient condition under which this simple (thus easy to implement) strategy for dual-robot systems can achieve time optimality as well as collision avoidance, i.e., the two robots reach their final positions without colliding with each other in the minimum amount of time, is derived. A demonstrative example is presented, showing how this strategy can be used for loading and unloading applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/4248/00163787.pdf","startPage":"641","endPage":"644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/70.163787","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.163787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=163787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum-time collision-free trajectory planning for dual-robot systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Robots","Path planning","Motion planning","Delay effects","Collision avoidance","Strategic planning","Sufficient conditions","Solid modeling","Multirobot systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","path planning","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","collision-free trajectory planning","dual-robot systems","path planning","geometric paths","sufficient condition","time optimality","collision avoidance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/163787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Minimum-time collision-free trajectory planning for dual-robot systems","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4313588","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum-time collision-free trajectory planning for dual-robot systems","sourcePdf":"00163787.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023731S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"33","articleId":"163787","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":163788,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In the time domain, the electric displacement is the convolution of the dielectric tensor with the electric field, and thus requires information from the entire signal history. It is shown that this difficulty can be avoided by returning to the dynamical equations from which the dielectric tensor is derived. By integrating these differential equations simultaneously with the Maxwell equations, temporal dispersion is fully incorporated. An FDTD approach utilizing the vector wave equation is also presented. The accuracy of the method is shown by comparison for a special case for which an analytic solution is available. The method is demonstrated with examples of pulse propagation in one and two dimensions. The computational limitations of present-generation computers are discussed. The application of this approach to the study of wave propagation in randomly structured ionization is addressed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/74.163808","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/74/4249/00163808.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/74.163808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4249","startPage":"33","endPage":"39","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-difference time-domain solution of Maxwell's equations for the dispersive ionosphere","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=163808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite-difference time-domain solution of Maxwell's equations for the dispersive ionosphere","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/163808/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4308381","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-difference time-domain solution of Maxwell's equations for the dispersive ionosphere","sourcePdf":"00163808.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041416S","chronDate":"Oct.  1992","isNumber":"4249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"60","articleId":"163808","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":163908,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A PTH/PWB model has been developed using the finite-element method (FEM) and the Manson-Coffin equation. The author discusses the model development and its application in an exhaustive test program where coupons of two laminate materials (FR4 and PI), four drilled hole sizes (0.0135 in, 0.0160 in, 0.023 in, and 0.043 in), and four nominal plating thicknesses (0.0005 in, 0.0010 in, 0.0015 in, and 0.0020 in) were tested. Based on measured ductility from the IPC Copper Foil Round-Robin Study, good agreement is obtained between the measured and predicted PTH reliability. A sensitivity analysis in which the model is used to predict the reliability of a PTH/PWB structure is presented. The variables examined are laminate T/sub g/ and TCE, drilled hole and pad diameter, minimum plating thickness, and plating nonuniformity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.1991.163908","publicationTitle":"1991 Proceedings 41st Electronic Components & Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1991 Proceedings 41st Electronic Components & Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/543/4250/00163908.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.1991.163908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4250","startPage":"410","endPage":"421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting plated-through-hole reliability in high temperature manufacturing processes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=163908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Predicting plated-through-hole reliability in high temperature manufacturing processes","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 May 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/163908/","conferenceDate":"11-16 May 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4188865","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting plated-through-hole reliability in high temperature manufacturing processes","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00163908.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027235S","chronDate":"11-16 May 1991","isNumber":"4250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"543","citationCount":"50","articleId":"163908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":163971,"authors":[{"name":"R.

First, finite-element simulations are used to estimate the assembly stiffness for the chip/substrate configurations. Next, the assembly stiffness is used with a constitutive relation to the solder to simulate stress-strain hysteresis loops under various conditions of ramp rate, dwell time, and temperature range. Finally, the mean cycles to failure are correlated with the creep strain per cycle using a simple Coffin-Manson relation. The analysis procedure does not rely on empirical relations to account for temperature and frequency effects; hence, extrapolation to field use conditions can be done with greater confidence. Since finite-element simulations are used to characterize the joint/assembly interaction, three-dimensional loading effects and local expansion mismatches are accounted for. The methodology can also be extended to power cycling conditions, which have the additional complication of temperature gradients in the structure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1991 Proceedings 41st Electronic Components & Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/543/4250/00163971.pdf","startPage":"797","endPage":"805","publicationTitle":"1991 Proceedings 41st Electronic Components & Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.1991.163971","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.1991.163971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=163971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fatigue analysis of flip chip assemblies using thermal stress simulations and a Coffin-Manson relation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thermal stresses","Fatigue","Flip chip","Assembly","Finite element methods","Hysteresis","Temperature distribution","Creep","Capacitive sensors","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["creep","finite element analysis","flip-chip devices","microassembling","packaging","soldering","stress-strain relations","thermal stress cracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fatigue analysis","fatigue life prediction","hybrid IC","flip chip assemblies","thermal stress simulations","Coffin-Manson relation","flip chip bonds","thermal cycling conditions","finite-element simulations","assembly stiffness","chip/substrate configurations","stress-strain hysteresis loops","ramp rate","dwell time","temperature range","creep strain","field use conditions","three-dimensional loading effects","local expansion mismatches","power cycling conditions","temperature gradients"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/163971/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Fatigue analysis of flip chip assemblies using thermal stress simulations and a Coffin-Manson relation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4199076","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-16 May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fatigue analysis of flip chip assemblies using thermal stress simulations and a Coffin-Manson relation","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00163971.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083936S","chronDate":"11-16 May 1991","isNumber":"4250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"543","citationCount":"25","articleId":"163971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":164003,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A set of logic circuits was implemented as FPGAs, each using a different logic block, and the speed of the implementation was measured.

Furthermore, significant gains in performance (from 10% to 41% reduction in total delay) can be achieved by connecting a small number of logic blocks together using hard-wired connections.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of field-programmable gate array logic block architecture for speed","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1991 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1991.164141","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1991 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/544/4251/00164141.pdf","startPage":"6.1/1","endPage":"6.1/6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1991.164141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=164141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/164141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of field-programmable gate array logic block architecture for speed","conferenceDate":"12-15 May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4183306","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of field-programmable gate array logic block architecture for speed","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00164141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061197S","chronDate":"12-15 May 1991","isNumber":"4251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"544","citationCount":"26","articleId":"164141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":164288,"authors":[{"name":"T.G.

The errors introduced in wake field calculations by such an approximation can be reduced by increasing the mesh size, therefore increasing the cost of computing.

The double-gate pMOS TFT also increases cell-storage node capacitance and soft-error immunity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.165328","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/4254/00165328.pdf","startPage":"1497","endPage":"1503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.165328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 150 ns 16-Mb CMOS SRAM with interdigitated bit-line architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/165328/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"A 150 ns 16-Mb CMOS SRAM with interdigitated bit-line architecture","volume":"27","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4320647","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 150 ns 16-Mb CMOS SRAM with interdigitated bit-line architecture","sourcePdf":"00165328.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065067S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"17","articleId":"165328","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":165329,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The current-sense amplifier shows three times the gain of a conventional voltage-sense amplifier and saves 60% of power dissipation while maintaining a very short sensing delay. The pre-output buffer reduces output delays by 0.5 ns to 0.75 ns. The 6.6- mu m/sup 2/ high-density memory cell uses a parallel transistor layout and phase-shifting photolithography. The critical charge that brings about soft error in a memory cell can be drastically increased by adjusting the resistances of poly-PMOS gate electrodes. This can be done without increasing process complexity or memory cell area. The 1-Mb SRAM was fabricated using 0.3- mu m CMOS quadrupole-poly and double-metal technology.

A transiently saturated full-swing BiCMOS (TS-FS-BiCMOS) logic circuit operates twice as fast as CMOS at 1.5-V supply. A newly developed transient-saturation technique, with which bipolar transistors saturate only during switching periods, is the key to sub-2-V operation because a high-speed full-swing operation is achieved to remove the voltage loss due to the base-emitter turn-on voltage. Both small load dependence and small fan-in dependence of gate delay time are attained with this technique.

To implement the SLSI on a silicon chip, three key techniques have been developed: (1) system redundancy for defect relief; (2) chip configuration and fabrication with blade masking to achieve a hybrid 38.16*50.4-mm/sup 2/ chip; and (3) large-capability and high-reliability 324-pin 54*86-mm/sup 2/ plastic pin grid array package. Using a system redundancy technique, a 60% yield for the SLSI is achieved with a 40% yield for the DRAM itself. That is twice the 30% yield of the conventional repair scheme. Access times are 65 ns for the DRAM and 14 ns for the SRAM with a 3.9-W chip power dissipation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/165342/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4320661","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"27","issue":"11","displayDocTitle":"A wafer-scale-level system integrated LSI containing eleven 4-Mb DRAMs, six 64-kb SRAMs, and an 18 K-gate array","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wafer-scale-level system integrated LSI containing eleven 4-Mb DRAMs, six 64-kb SRAMs, and an 18 K-gate array","sourcePdf":"00165342.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052182S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"4","articleId":"165342","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":165344,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Double-bit soft errors frequently occur in DRAM cells with trench capacitors, when charged alpha particles impinge on the intervening space between two vertical capacitors causing plasma shorts between them. The conventional on-chip error-correcting codes (ECCs) cannot correct such double-bit word-line soft errors, which significantly increase the uncorrectable error rate (UER). An ECC circuit that uses an augmented rectangular product code to detect and correct double-bit soft errors is presented. The proposed circuit automatically corrects the addressed bit if it is faulty, and then quickly locates the other faulty bit. A comprehensive study is made to estimate improvements in soft error rate (SER) and mean time to failure (MTTF). The ability of the circuit to correct soft errors in the presence of multiple-bit errors has also been analyzed by combinatorial enumeration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.165344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/4254/00165344.pdf","startPage":"1623","endPage":"1633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.165344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An on-chip ECC circuit for correcting soft errors in DRAMs with trench capacitors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=165344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"An on-chip ECC circuit for correcting soft errors in DRAMs with trench capacitors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/165344/","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4320663","volume":"27","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An on-chip ECC circuit for correcting soft errors in DRAMs with trench capacitors","sourcePdf":"00165344.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0379S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"16","articleId":"165344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":165345,"authors":[{"name":"H.J.

The traffic enforcer adopted in this work contains a buffer to delay and reshape the violating cells that do not comply with some agreed-upon traffic parameters, and thus is also called a traffic shaper. The queue manager manages the queued cells in network nodes in such a way that higher priority cells are always served first, low-priority cells are discarded when the queue is full, and any interference between same-priority cells is prevented. Architectures for the traffic shaper and the queue manager are proposed. A key component, called the sequencer chip, has been implemented and tested to realize both architectures. The sequencer chip uses 1.2- mu m CMOS technology. It contains about 150 K transistors, has a die size of 7.5 mm*8.3 mm, and is packages in a 223-pin ceramic pin-grid-array (PGA) carrier.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/165345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4320664","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI sequencer chip for ATM traffic shaper and queue manager","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI sequencer chip for ATM traffic shaper and queue manager","sourcePdf":"00165345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033581S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"48","articleId":"165345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":165356,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

The estimation procedure based on bearings only is quite different from that based on frequency measurements. From the Cramer-Rao (CR) analysis of the single-measurement case, the characteristic features of each method become transparent and an intuitive understanding of both methods is provided. One of the major results is that the orientation of the error ellipses of the bearings method (BM) and frequency method (FM) differ significantly. From this a considerable integration gain in accuracy results, when processing the combined set of bearing and frequency measurements. The results of the theoretical CR analysis are verified in a numerical simulation based on the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation. The simulations demonstrate that a combined method is definitely superior to BM and FM with respect to the bias and the size of the error ellipses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient method of passive emitter location","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/7.165371","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/4255/00165371.pdf","startPage":"1091","endPage":"1104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.165371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4255","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=165371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/165371/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"An efficient method of passive emitter location","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4370013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient method of passive emitter location","sourcePdf":"00165371.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058745S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"51","articleId":"165371","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":165375,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is also shown that when program behavior changes, LRU replacement moves quickly toward the steady-state allocation if it is far from optimal, but converges slowly as the allocation approaches the steady-state allocation. An efficient combinatorial algorithm for determining the optimal steady-state allocation, which, in theory, could be used to reduce the length of the transient, is described. The algorithm generalizes to multilevel cache memories. For multiprogrammed systems, a cache-replacement policy better than LRU replacement is given. The policy increases the memory available to the running process until the allocation reaches a threshold time beyond which the replacement policy does not increase the cache memory allocated to the running process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/4256/00165388.pdf","startPage":"1054","endPage":"1068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal partitioning of cache memory","doi":"10.1109/12.165388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.165388","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=165388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/165388/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"Optimal partitioning of cache memory","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4294275","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal partitioning of cache memory","sourcePdf":"00165388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047043S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"103","articleId":"165388","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":165390,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

A similar bound is derived for networks of ternary neurons, storing sparse vectors over (-1,0,1)/sup N/. These results, pertaining to stability and error correction with probability tending to one as the number of neurons tends to infinity, generalize and extend previously known capacity bounds for binary networks storing vectors of equally probable (+or-1) bits. Lower bounds on the capacities of binary and ternary networks of finite sizes are also derived. These bounds suggest critical network sizes that guarantee high gains in capacity per neuron for given sparsites.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/165439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","volume":"38","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4320667","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Lower bounds on the capacities of binary and ternary networks storing sparse random vectors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lower bounds on the capacities of binary and ternary networks storing sparse random vectors","sourcePdf":"00165439.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040076S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"8","articleId":"165439","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":165444,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The set of orthogonal moments based on Legendre polynomials is employed. A general class of signal-dependent noise models is taken into account.

This reveals mutual relationships between a number of moments, the image smoothness, sampling rate, and noise model characteristics. The problem of an automatic (data-driven) section of an optimal number of moments is studied.

In both cases, the MMSE is decomposed into the MMSE of the estimator, which is informed of the exact states of the signal and noise, and an additional error term. This term is tightly upper and lower bounded. The bounds for the discrete-time signals are developed using distribution tilting and Shannon's lower bound on the probability of a random variable exceeding a given threshold. The analysis for the continuous-time signal is performed using Duncan's theorem. The bounds in this case are developed by applying the data processing theorem to sampled versions of the state process and its estimate, and by using Fano's inequality. The bounds in both cases are explicitly calculated for CSMs with Gaussian subsources. For causal estimation, these bounds approach zero harmonically as the duration of the observed signals approaches infinity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.165445","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/4258/00165445.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.165445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"1709","endPage":"1724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lower and upper bounds on the minimum mean-square error in composite source signal estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=165445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Lower and upper bounds on the minimum mean-square error in composite source signal estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/165445/","volume":"38","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4320673","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lower and upper bounds on the minimum mean-square error in composite source signal estimation","sourcePdf":"00165445.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048177S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"11","articleId":"165445","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":165446,"authors":[{"name":"I.

It is assumed that a transmitter-receiver pair in a radio network is affected by a set of interferers, using the same modulation and power, whose positions are modeled as a Poisson field in the plane. Assuming a 1/r/sup gamma / propagation power loss law, the probability distributions for the noise at the receiver are found to be the stable distributions. Results are given for the probability of symbol error and link capacity as a function of the distance between the transmitter and receiver for direct sequence and frequency hopping spread spectrum schemes.

Consequently, there exists no (N, K, N-K+1) group code C over an non-abelian group G if 1<K<N. Moreover, any normal code C with a non-abelian output space has minimum Hamming distance equal to D=1. These results follow from the fact that non-abelian groups have nontrivial commutator subgroups. Finally, if C is an (N, K, D) group code over an abelian group G that is not elementary abelian, then there exists an (N, K, D) group code over a smaller elementary abelian group G'.

It is based on evaluation of the bias, local and global accuracy, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance. The results show that the intervening medium does not bias either wideband estimation, due to the effect of tracking the scattering target. The presence of intervening tissue actually improves the global accuracy of both wideband estimators, without a significant change in the local accuracy of either wideband estimator. After the transmission of P pulses, a comparison of the performance of the two strategies shows that the cross-correlation estimator requires P/sup 2/ correlations to achieve performance similar to that of the WMLE with P operations. In addition, the WMLE can increase the effective SNR in comparison with cross correlation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/165561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1992","volume":"39","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4321856","pubMedId":"18267692","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The effect of frequency dependent scattering and attenuation on the estimation of blood velocity using ultrasound","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of frequency dependent scattering and attenuation on the estimation of blood velocity using ultrasound","sourcePdf":"00165561.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052788S","chronDate":"Nov.  1992","isNumber":"4262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"31","articleId":"165561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":165589,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

The nets are trained and the tree is grown using a gradient-type learning algorithm in the multiclass case. The method improves on standard classification tree design methods in that it generally produces trees with lower error rates and fewer nodes. It also reduces the problems associated with training large unstructured nets and transfers the problem of selecting the size of the net to the simpler problem of finding a tree of the right size. An efficient tree pruning algorithm is proposed for this purpose. Trees constructed with the method and the CART method are compared on a waveform recognition problem and a handwritten character recognition problem. The approach demonstrates significant decrease in error rate and tree size.

A general result is given showing that nonlinear control systems can be stabilized using two hidden layers, but not, in general, using just one.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.165599","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/4264/00165599.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.165599","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"981","endPage":"990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback stabilization using two-hidden-layer nets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=165599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Feedback stabilization using two-hidden-layer nets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/165599/","volume":"3","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4322840","pubMedId":"18276494","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback stabilization using two-hidden-layer nets","sourcePdf":"00165599.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037312S","chronDate":"Nov.  1992","isNumber":"4264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"132","articleId":"165599","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":165600,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This can be done by forcing this behavior as part of the training algorithm. This is done in double backpropagation by forming an energy function that is the sum of the normal energy term found in backpropagation and an additional term that is a function of the Jacobian. Significant improvement is shown with different architectures and different test sets, especially with architectures that had previously been shown to have very good performance when trained using backpropagation. It is shown that double backpropagation, as compared to backpropagation, creates weights that are smaller, thereby causing the output of the neurons to spend more time in the linear region.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=165600","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Backpropagation algorithms","Jacobian matrices","Neurons","Signal to noise ratio","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","learning","generalization performance","double backpropagation","training algorithm","energy function"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/4264/00165600.pdf","startPage":"991","endPage":"997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.165600","doi":"10.1109/72.165600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving generalization performance using double backpropagation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/165600/","displayDocTitle":"Improving generalization performance using double backpropagation","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4322841","pubMedId":"18276495","volume":"3","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving generalization performance using double backpropagation","sourcePdf":"00165600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082845S","chronDate":"Nov.  1992","isNumber":"4264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"90","articleId":"165600","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":165601,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The results obtained are in good agreement with those reported by other authors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/75.165633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.165633","endPage":"433","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/4265/00165633.pdf","startPage":"431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computation of resonant frequencies and quality factors of open dielectric resonators by a combination of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and Prony's methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/165633/","displayDocTitle":"Computation of resonant frequencies and quality factors of open dielectric resonators by a combination of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and Prony's methods","volume":"2","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"4328833","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation of resonant frequencies and quality factors of open dielectric resonators by a combination of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and Prony's methods","sourcePdf":"00165633.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035213S","chronDate":"Nov.  1992","isNumber":"4265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"86","articleId":"165633","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":165634,"authors":[{"name":"D.T.

In particular, expressions are developed for the mean values of the power gain in any direction of interest, the output power, and the norm of the weight-error vector, as a function of the number of snapshots and the number of smoothing steps. It is shown that, in general, the smoothing, in addition to decorrelating the sources, can alleviate the effects of finite-data perturbations. The above expressions are reduced to the case in which no spatial smoothing is used. These expressions are valid for an arbitrary array and for arbitrarily correlated signals. For this case, an expression for the variance of the power gain is also developed. For a single interference case it is shown explicitly how the SNR, spacing of the interference from the desired signal and the correlation between them influence the beamformer performance.

The method can be applied to nonuniform array geometries in which the individual elements have arbitrary (and differing) radiation patterns. The method is iterative and uses sequential updating to ensure that peak sidelobe levels in the array meet the specification. Computation of each successive pattern is based on the solution of a linearly constrained least-squares problem. The constraints ensure that the magnitude of the sidelobes at the locations of the previous peaks takes on the prespecified values. Phase values for the sidelobes do not change during this process, and problems associated with choosing a specific phase value are therefore avoided. Experimental evidence suggests that the procedure terminates in remarkably few iterations, even for arrays with significant numbers of elements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.165660","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/4266/00165660.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.165660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"2737","endPage":"2746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple algorithm to achieve desired patterns for arbitrary arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=165660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"A simple algorithm to achieve desired patterns for arbitrary arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/165660/","volume":"40","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4328854","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple algorithm to achieve desired patterns for arbitrary arrays","sourcePdf":"00165660.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052181S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"121","articleId":"165660","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":165662,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Parallelism is realized on two levels: one within the split and merge operations, where more than one merge (or split) may proceed concurrently, and the second between the split and merge operations, where several splits may be performed in parallel with merges. Both the split and merge operations are based on nearest neighbor communications between the processing elements (PEs), and facilitating low communication costs. The basic arithmetic operations required to perform split and merge are comparison and addition, allowing a simple structure of the PE as well as a hardwired control. A local of 512 bytes is sufficient to hold the interim data associated with each PE. A prototype PE has been constructed using 3 mu m double-metal CMOS technology. Scaling up to 0.8 mu m, it is possible to incorporate 32 PEs on a 5 cm/sup 2/ chip. With sufficiently large PE window sizes, image segmentation can be achieved in linear time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image segmentation on a 2D array by a directed split and merge procedure","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.165668","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/4266/00165668.pdf","startPage":"2804","endPage":"2813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.165668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4266","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=165668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/165668/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Image segmentation on a 2D array by a directed split and merge procedure","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4334409","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image segmentation on a 2D array by a directed split and merge procedure","sourcePdf":"00165668.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02365S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"21","articleId":"165668","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":165670,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Results of these improvements are given, including a four-dimensional FFT (fast Fourier transform) configuration that can perform a single 77520-point complex FFT in 8.87 milliseconds, and once the processor's pipeline is full, a 77520-point complex transform can be completed every 2.22 milliseconds.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NAECON.1991.165728","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1991 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference NAECON 1991","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1991 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference NAECON 1991","pdfPath":"/iel2/566/4267/00165728.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAECON.1991.165728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4267","startPage":"90","endPage":"97 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design enhancements for the Air Force Institute of Technology's Winograd Fourier transform processor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=165728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design enhancements for the Air Force Institute of Technology's Winograd Fourier transform processor","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/165728/","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4136769","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design enhancements for the Air Force Institute of Technology's Winograd Fourier transform processor","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00165728.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029479S","chronDate":"20-24 May 1991","isNumber":"4267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"566","citationCount":"1","articleId":"165728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":165731,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

Several variations of the genetic algorithm are described, and the search performance is compared to that of the base-line method of randomly selected weights. It is pointed out that dynamical networks support self-sustaining patterns of oscillation which can be initiated by a one-time input strobe. These self-sustaining patterns, or attractor cycles, evolve into a repeating pattern for most combinations of network weights and input strobes. Attractor cycles vary in length and are a function of the particular network weights and the particular strobe. An interesting property of these networks is that a particular set of network weights can produce, or recall, a variety of repeating patterns, where the one that is evoked depends on the triggering strobe. This effectively is the storage of sequential patterns in the form of attractors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/165898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4168901","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 1991","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An exploration of genetic algorithms for the selection of connection weights in dynamical neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An exploration of genetic algorithms for the selection of connection weights in dynamical neural networks","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00165898.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045243S","chronDate":"20-24 May 1991","isNumber":"4267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"566","citationCount":"4","articleId":"165898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":166468,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The reasons why replacing an internal combustion vehicle (ICV) with an electrically powered equivalent greatly reduces air pollution, not only where the EV is driven, but over the rest of the map as well are discussed. Three drawbacks that have kept EVs from taking over, despite the fact that they are quieter and more reliable as well as less polluting than their internal combustion counterparts, are discussed.

In the theta - rho space, the transform can be expressed as the sum of the translation term and the intrinsic term. This formulation allows the translation, rotation, and intrinsic parameters of the curve to be easily decoupled. A shape signature, called the scalable translation invariant rotation-to-shifting (STIRS) signature, is obtained from the theta - rho space by computing the distances between pairs of points having the same theta value. This signature is invariant to translation and can be easily normalized, and rotation in the image space corresponds to circular shifting of the signature. Matching two signatures only amounts to computing a 1D correlation. The height and location of a peak (if it exists) indicate the similarity and orientation of the test object with respect to the reference object. The location of the test object is obtained, once the orientation is known, by an inverse transform (voting) from the theta - rho space to the x-y plane.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/4277/00166622.pdf","startPage":"1076","endPage":"1089","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.166622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.166622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=166622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shapes recognition using the straight line Hough transform: theory and generalization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Testing","Pattern recognition","Concurrent computing","Pattern matching","Voting","Image reconstruction","Computational efficiency","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hough transforms","image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable translation invariant rotation to shifting signature","image recognition","straight line Hough transform","shape matching","shape signature","image space","1D correlation","inverse transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/166622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Shapes recognition using the straight line Hough transform: theory and generalization","volume":"14","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4344392","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shapes recognition using the straight line Hough transform: theory and generalization","sourcePdf":"00166622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060719S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"92","articleId":"166622","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":166624,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The parameters to be calibrated are effective focal length, one-pixel width on an image plane, image distortion center, and distortion coefficient. A simple-pattern calibration chart composed of parallel straight lines is introduced as a reference for calibration. An ordinary 2D model fitting is decomposed into two 1D model fittings on the column and row of a frame buffer across the image distortion center by ingeniously utilizing the point symmetry characteristic of image distortion. Some parameters with a calibration chart are eliminated by setting up a calibration chart precisely and by utilizing negligibly low distortion near the image distortion center. Thus, the number of unknown parameters to be calibrated is drastically decreased, enabling simple and useful calibration. The effectiveness of the proposed calibration method is confirmed by experimentation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.166624","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/4277/00166624.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.166624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277","startPage":"1095","endPage":"1099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple calibration algorithm for high-distortion lens camera","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=166624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simple calibration algorithm for high-distortion lens camera","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/166624/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4344394","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple calibration algorithm for high-distortion lens camera","sourcePdf":"00166624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052967S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"46","articleId":"166624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":166625,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The input to the line extractor is in the form of an edge image, where the contrast and direction of each edge pixel is specified. The system scans the edge image left to right and top to bottom and assigns a line label for each scanned edge pixel, thereby generating a label image. At the end of this process, each edge pixel has a line label associated with it, and edge pixels that belong to the same line will be assigned the same line label. In addition, with each line label, a record that stores the end points, the average contrast, and the pixel support of the line is generated. The label image is used as a spatial index to further link fragmented lines.

The tracking performances of the controller applied to a two-degree-of-freedom SCARA is illustrated by a real-time implementation based on a single-chip digital signal processor (DSP).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.166731","startPage":"105","endPage":"111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.166731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/4282/00166731.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive controller for a direct-drive SCARA robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/166731/","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive controller for a direct-drive SCARA robot","volume":"39","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4170286","publicationDate":"April 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive controller for a direct-drive SCARA robot","sourcePdf":"00166731.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028237S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"4282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"27","articleId":"166731","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":166746,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A vehicle equipped with the corresponding receivers and data acquisition system was followed by the helicopter on the selected routes. The measurement campaign was undertaken in two phases in September 1991 and in April 1992. The results show considerable decrease in signal attenuation when the path elevation angle is high due to reduced shadowing. In general, the attenuation increases with the increasing radio frequency. Foliage density has also been found to influence the fade levels, especially at higher path elevation angles. The overall analysis of the propagation data indicates that the fading character of the LMS channel is significantly dependent on the surrounding environment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.166747","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"1219","endPage":"1226","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/4283/00166747.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.166747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Narrowband channel statistics from multiband propagation measurements applicable to high elevation angle land-mobile satellite systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Narrowband","Statistics","Least squares approximation","Helicopters","Attenuation","Satellite broadcasting","Radio transmitters","Frequency","Vehicles","Data acquisition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading","mobile radio systems","radiowave propagation","satellite relay systems","statistical analysis","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["L-band","helicopter-borne transmitter module","S-band","UHF","Ku-band","SHF","foliage density effects","narrowband channel statistics","multiband propagation measurements","high elevation angle land-mobile satellite systems","attenuation","fade levels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Narrowband channel statistics from multiband propagation measurements applicable to high elevation angle land-mobile satellite systems","volume":"10","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4311927","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/166747/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrowband channel statistics from multiband propagation measurements applicable to high elevation angle land-mobile satellite systems","sourcePdf":"00166747.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082572S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"31","articleId":"166747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":166751,"authors":[{"name":"O.N.

The upper bounds on the average bit error probability in both AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels are derived. Computer simulations are also used to verify the analytical results. In fast-fading shadowed mobile satellite channels the scheme is shown to outperform conventional QPSK techniques. It maintains the low complexity of 4PSK, but its performance is comparable to that of four-state 8PSK TCM schemes.

Simulation data demonstrate that it can track the severe phase jitter encountered on the fading channel free of the false lock which plagues conventional techniques. The algorithm multiplexes known symbols into the data stream, establishing an absolute reference free of decision errors that is used to estimate the fading phase. An improvement to the SA algorithm which extracts phase information from the data-bearing symbols is proposed. It is found that the new technique is more effective for larger K.

A system employing SADD phase estimation, trellis-coded modulation, interleaving, and amplitude weighting within the Viterbi decoder yielded the best BER performance on the shadowed MSAT channel considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.166756","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/4283/00166756.pdf","startPage":"1289","endPage":"1299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.166756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol-aided plus decision-directed reception for PSK/TCM modulation on shadowed mobile satellite fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=166756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/166756/","displayDocTitle":"Symbol-aided plus decision-directed reception for PSK/TCM modulation on shadowed mobile satellite fading channels","volume":"10","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4311935","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol-aided plus decision-directed reception for PSK/TCM modulation on shadowed mobile satellite fading channels","sourcePdf":"00166756.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035978S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"64","articleId":"166756","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":166757,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

For the generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC) signal processing configuration, this algorithm, CG-GSC, exhibits improved convergence over previous methods. Theoretical expressions are presented for convergence and weight update of a linearly constrained constant modulus generalized sidelobe canceler. Theoretical expressions are then derived for the conjugate direction vectors. These vectors are used to update the filter weights for a conjugate gradient adaptation rule. A simulation study of the conjugate adaptation rule reveals the increase in convergence rate for the generalized sidelobe canceler. Performance comparisons of the CG-GSC and a first-order gradient GSC for a BPSK signal with multipath and white noise interference indicate that the CG-GSC adaptation rule not only increases convergence by a factor of five compared to the first-order gradient GSC, but in some instances improves the bit error rate of the demodulated BPSK signal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Signal processing algorithms","Binary phase shift keying","Character generation","Adaptive signal processing","Constraint theory","Filters","White noise","Interference","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","conjugate gradient methods","convergence of numerical methods","demodulation","error statistics","filtering and prediction theory","interference suppression","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath reduction","demodulation","constant modulus conjugate gradient techniques","adaptive processor","generalized sidelobe canceler","signal processing","convergence","conjugate direction vectors","filter weights","conjugate gradient adaptation rule","BPSK signal","white noise","bit error rate"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.166757","startPage":"1300","endPage":"1305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/4283/00166757.pdf","doi":"10.1109/49.166757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipath reduction using constant modulus conjugate gradient techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Multipath reduction using constant modulus conjugate gradient techniques","accessionNumber":"4311936","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","volume":"10","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/166757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipath reduction using constant modulus conjugate gradient techniques","sourcePdf":"00166757.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089048S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"4","articleId":"166757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":166758,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The objective is to improve perceived quality of cellular service by minimizing both the probability of forced termination of ongoing calls due to handover failures and the degradation in spectrum utilization. A model based on a multiple-priority nonpreemptive queuing discipline is developed. New calls are blocked if all channels are occupied. Handover requests are queued such that as soon as a channel is available, it is offered to the mobile subscriber with the measurement results closest to the minimum acceptable power level for communication. Service rate is given by channel occupancy time distribution and is assumed to be exponential. The performance of a cellular system employing the proposed handover policy is evaluated analytically and by simulation, and results are compared to those obtained when the cellular system employs nonprioritized call handling and first-in/first-out queuing discipline. This provides lower probability of forced termination and less call blocking, less reduction in traffic, and less delay.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A measurement-based prioritization scheme for handovers in mobile cellular networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.166761","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/4283/00166761.pdf","startPage":"1343","endPage":"1350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.166761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4283","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=166761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/166761/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"A measurement-based prioritization scheme for handovers in mobile cellular networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4311940","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A measurement-based prioritization scheme for handovers in mobile cellular networks","sourcePdf":"00166761.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059387S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"221","articleId":"166761","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":166786,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

The array transducer consists of special lead-titanate ceramic elements of 16 sectors and two tracks attached on a element is driven by a complementary pair of power MOSFETs at 750 kHz. An annular focal field approximated by the Mth order Bessel function is theoretically predicted to be formed when the array elements are driven with a phase distribution that rotates M (<or=8) times per rotation along a track. A 3-D acoustic field measurement system was constructed using a multichannel membrane hydrophone, and fields from the prototype transducer were measured at various drive modes in water. The measured multidimensional field patterns agree well with theoretical predictions at each mode. Focal acoustic power from the transducer was also measured at various drive modes by deflection of a plate located in the focal region. It is demonstrated that the applicator is capable of producing focal acoustic power at the level required for hyperthermia.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/58.166807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.166807","endPage":"38","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/4285/00166807.pdf","startPage":"32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustical evaluation of a prototype sector-vortex phased-array applicator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/166807/","displayDocTitle":"Acoustical evaluation of a prototype sector-vortex phased-array applicator","volume":"39","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4124704","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18263115","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustical evaluation of a prototype sector-vortex phased-array applicator","sourcePdf":"00166807.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048559S","chronDate":"Jan.  1992","isNumber":"4285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"39","articleId":"166807","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":166810,"authors":[{"name":"J.-H.

Three sets of linear arrays with nine 1 mm*1 mm elements on dielectric diaphragms have been made. They were fabricated with (1) a solid substrate, (2) a single large diaphragm window underneath the entire array, and (3) a small diaphragm window (SW) for each array element. To estimate crosstalk and fringe field effects in each array, the authors measured each array's angular response in the far field of an unfocused source transducer. A Fourier transform analysis was then performed on the measured data to obtain each array's directivity pattern, which in turn was fitted to theoretical curves based on a crosstalk model. Crosstalk-related parameters have been extracted from curve-fitting and their values show that the array with the SW structure for each element has the least electrical and acoustical crosstalk and fringe field effects.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.166810","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"48","endPage":"53","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/4285/00166810.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.166810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crosstalk reduction with a micromachined diaphragm structure for integrated ultrasound transducer arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crosstalk","Dielectric substrates","Ultrasonic imaging","Ultrasonic transducers","Ultrasonic transducer arrays","Solids","Dielectric measurements","Fourier transforms","Pattern analysis","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","Fourier analysis","integrated circuit technology","micromechanical devices","polymer films","ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk reduction","electrical crosstalk","micromachined diaphragm structure","integrated ultrasound transducer arrays","polyvinylidene fluoride","PVDF","linear arrays","dielectric diaphragms","fringe field effects","angular response","Fourier transform analysis","directivity pattern","acoustical crosstalk"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Crosstalk reduction with a micromachined diaphragm structure for integrated ultrasound transducer arrays","volume":"39","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4124707","pubMedId":"18263118","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/166810/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crosstalk reduction with a micromachined diaphragm structure for integrated ultrasound transducer arrays","sourcePdf":"00166810.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028357S","chronDate":"Jan.  1992","isNumber":"4285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"29","articleId":"166810","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":166812,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The theoretical analysis shows that when the electrode finger thickness increases through a threshold value, a mode conversion phenomenon occurs and the value of the reflection phase changes from the positive to the negative.

A record responsivity of 0.96 A/W at 1.3- mu m wavelength, corresponding to a quantum efficiency of 92%, was measured at 5 V and showed virtually no internal gain at 20 V. Packaged devices with 150- mu m-diameter large detection area showed a 3-dB bandwidth of 4 GHz at 5 V with fiber pigtail butt-coupled package and 3.5 GHz with fiber pigtail silicon V-grooved package. Switching to front-illumination improves the bandwidth by 30-40% with 45-50% reduction of responsivity. Planar and mesa devices both show a low capacitance per unit area of 3.0 nF/cm/sup 2/ and dark current density of 5.6*10/sup -5/ A/cm/sup 2/ at 5 V. Preliminary reliability test results show that the detector biased at 5 V survived temperature cycling of -35 degrees C to 200 degrees C, high-temperature burn-in at 125 degrees C for 168 h and subsequent short-term accelerated aging at 200 degrees C for 120 h without degradation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/68.166955","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/4290/00166955.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.166955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4290","startPage":"1241","endPage":"1244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance back-illuminated InGaAs/InAlAs MSM photodetector with a record responsivity of 0.96 A/W","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=166955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-performance back-illuminated InGaAs/InAlAs MSM photodetector with a record responsivity of 0.96 A/W","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/166955/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4345861","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance back-illuminated InGaAs/InAlAs MSM photodetector with a record responsivity of 0.96 A/W","sourcePdf":"00166955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054084S","chronDate":"Nov.  1992","isNumber":"4290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"68","articleId":"166955","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":166961,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Newkirk","affiliation":["AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Newkirk","id":"37357570800"},{"name":"U.

It is assumed that learning is episodic, that the performance measures of an episode are dependent only on the final state reached in evaluating the corresponding test case, and that the aggregate performance measures of the HMs involved are independent of the order of evaluation of test cases. The learning model is based on testing a population of competing HMs for an application problem, and switches from one to another dynamically, depending on the outcome of previous tests. Its goal is to find a good HM within the resource constraints, with proper tradeoff between cost and quality. It extends existing work on classifier systems by addressing issues related to delays in feedback, scheduling of tests of HMs under limited resources, anomalies in performance evaluation, and scalability of HMs. Experience in applying the learning method is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/4291/00166988.pdf","startPage":"454","endPage":"474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doi":"10.1109/69.166988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.166988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4291","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=166988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Population-based learning: a method for learning from examples under resource constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Aggregates","Switches","Machine learning","Delay","Feedback","System testing","Scalability","Learning systems","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning by example"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["population based learning","feedback delays","test scheduling","learning from examples","resource constraints","performance-related heuristic methods","knowledge-lean application","performance measures","cost","quality","classifier systems","limited resources","performance evaluation","scalability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/166988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Population-based learning: a method for learning from examples under resource constraints","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4322612","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Population-based learning: a method for learning from examples under resource constraints","sourcePdf":"00166988.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049314S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"11","articleId":"166988","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":166990,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Using an automated patterned wafer inspection system, 20 wafers were inspected for each of the sample sizes. Inspected die were selected in a random pattern across the wafer and remained the same for each inspection. The inspected area within each die was varied to obtain the desired total inspection area. This allowed the data for the different sample sizes to be directly compared and reduced the effect of 'defect clustering'. In addition, 10 of the wafers received whole wafer inspection for comparisons to the true defect population parameters. The results were evaluated using statistical techniques. Different sample sizes are compared using statistical process control charts, linear regression, evaluation of alpha and beta risk, and defect Pareto charts. It is concluded that sampling can provide reliable and accurate defect density data for making conclusions about the defect population, if the sampled area is chosen carefully.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Process control","Inspection","Instruments","Linear regression","Analysis of variance","Silicon","Semiconductor device reliability","Semiconductor devices","Fabrication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inspection","integrated circuit manufacture","process computer control","statistical process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alpha risk","sampling techniques","patterned wafer inspection systems","automated defect inspections","inspection areas","total inspection area","sample sizes","true defect population","statistical process control","linear regression","beta risk","defect Pareto charts","defect density data","defect population"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASMC.1991.167391","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] IEEE/SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference and Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] IEEE/SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference and Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel2/583/4298/00167391.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"97","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMC.1991.167391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating different sampling techniques for process control using automated patterned wafer inspection systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=167391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating different sampling techniques for process control using automated patterned wafer inspection systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/167391/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4234315","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating different sampling techniques for process control using automated patterned wafer inspection systems","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00167391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030281S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct 1991","isNumber":"4298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"583","citationCount":"2","articleId":"167391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":167507,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

This consists of a hybrid phase array fed reflector in which a small array illuminates a large aperture reflector. They also show in such systems, generalized reflector shaping can still be advantageous and describe how this additional degree of freedom provides control over the antenna geometry and feed array power distribution. The design process is in three stages and is discussed using an illustrative example. First a reflector aperture field is synthesised, which is then used as an input to the reflector synthesis. Reconfiguration is achieved by re-synthesis of the feed array phase. They conclude that geometrical optics reflector shaping can be used effectively in configurations with distributed sources, and that reflector shaping can be an advantage in array fed systems designed for reconfigurable contoured beams.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Reflector Antennas for the 90's","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Reflector Antennas for the 90's","pdfPath":"/iel3/1573/4365/00168369.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4365","startPage":"2/1","endPage":"2/4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reflector shaping in hybrid antennas for contoured beams","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=168369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"Reflector shaping in hybrid antennas for contoured beams","chronOrPublicationDate":"15 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/168369/","conferenceDate":"15-15 May 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4199548","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reflector shaping in hybrid antennas for contoured beams","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00168369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023272S","chronDate":"15 May 1992","isNumber":"4365","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1573","citationCount":"24","articleId":"168369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":168647,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

The design consists of a planar grid of devices placed in a Fabry-Perot cavity. Capacitive feedback is provided to the gate, allowing oscillation at much higher frequencies than previous grids. The oscillation frequency is dependent on the device characteristics, the resonator cavity, and the symmetries of the grid. A transmission-line model for the grid is discussed and used to design two oscillator arrays. A 16-element grid has produced 335 mW of power at 11.6 GHz with a DC-to-RF conversion efficiency of 20%. This design was scaled to produce a 36-element grid oscillator with output power of 235 mW at 17 GHz. These results represent a significant improvement in the performance of planar grid oscillators. The planar configuration of the grid is very convenient for monolithic integration and is easily scalable to millimeter-wave frequencies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/168756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4327210","volume":"40","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Planar MESFET grid oscillators using gate feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planar MESFET grid oscillators using gate feedback","sourcePdf":"00168756.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032791S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"36","articleId":"168756","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":168757,"authors":[{"name":"S.W.

As examples BPSK and QPSK modulation formats are studied herein and compared to their differentially coherent counterparts of DPSK and DQPSK.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.168795","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/4391/00168795.pdf","startPage":"1644","endPage":"1653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.168795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision-directed burst-mode carrier synchronization techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Decision-directed burst-mode carrier synchronization techniques","volume":"40","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4332985","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/168795/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision-directed burst-mode carrier synchronization techniques","sourcePdf":"00168795.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056349S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"36","articleId":"168795","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":168796,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A nonlinear circuit is partitioned into two subnetworks with substitution sources, and their responses are solved by a combined frequency-domain and time-domain method. The total response of the combined circuit can be calculated by an iterative technique based on either the Newton or the relaxation harmonic balance method. Since the methods are based on both time-domain and frequency-domain algorithms, they are called the Newton and the relaxation hybrid harmonic balance methods, respectively. The methods can be applied efficiently to strong nonlinear circuits containing high-Q subnetworks such as filter circuits and crystal oscillators. When a large-scale circuit is partitioned into large linear subnetworks and small nonlinear subnetworks, the method can also be applied efficiently.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/4396/00168917.pdf","startPage":"649","endPage":"661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","doi":"10.1109/81.168917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.168917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=168917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Steady-state analysis of nonlinear circuits based on hybrid methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Steady-state","Circuit analysis","Nonlinear circuits","Time domain analysis","Partitioning algorithms","Frequency domain analysis","Power harmonic filters","Iterative methods","Iterative algorithms","Oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain analysis","iterative methods","nonlinear network analysis","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain approach","Newton method","nonlinear circuits","hybrid methods","steady-state responses","frequency-domain approaches","subnetworks","substitution sources","iterative technique","relaxation harmonic balance method","harmonic balance methods","high-Q subnetworks","filter circuits","crystal oscillators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/168917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"Steady-state analysis of nonlinear circuits based on hybrid methods","volume":"39","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4357378","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Steady-state analysis of nonlinear circuits based on hybrid methods","sourcePdf":"00168917.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040717S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"31","articleId":"168917","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":168922,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.B.

It provides the flexibility of maximizing the signal-to-noise (SNR) when quantization noise with an arbitrary spectral density is presented. A numerical method, the samples-sum-estimation (SSE) method, is introduced to simplify the objective function. Examples show that the proposed design enjoys at least a factor of two reduction in the multiplication rate when compared with conventional FIR filters. This implementation becomes more attractive for applications in modulators with multibit output such as the MASH modulator as well as Sigma - Delta modulators with a multibit internal quantizer. The proposed design achieves a SNR of less than 1 dB from that obtained with an ideal low-pass filter at different decimation ratios while the group delay displays an approximately constant value.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.168941","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/4397/00168941.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"505","doi":"10.1109/82.168941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polyphase IIR decimation filter design for oversampled A/D converters with approximately linear phase","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"Polyphase IIR decimation filter design for oversampled A/D converters with approximately linear phase","volume":"39","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4351627","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/168941/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polyphase IIR decimation filter design for oversampled A/D converters with approximately linear phase","sourcePdf":"00168941.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033626S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"1","articleId":"168941","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":168943,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

If the classification coronary artery disease vs. non-coronary artery disease was made using this trained neural network, 72% of all tachycardias were diagnosed correctly.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CIC.1991.169071","startPage":"165","endPage":"168","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings Computers in Cardiology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.1991.169071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4398","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings Computers in Cardiology","pdfPath":"/iel2/385/4398/00169071.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of the etiology of wide-QRS tachycardias using an artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/169071/","displayDocTitle":"Determination of the etiology of wide-QRS tachycardias using an artificial neural network","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4249230","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sep 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of the etiology of wide-QRS tachycardias using an artificial neural network","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"00169071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077365S","chronDate":"23-26 Sep 1991","isNumber":"4398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"385","citationCount":"2","articleId":"169071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":169072,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The decomposition of the classification problem into three easier-to-manage subproblems is discussed. A shared multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture is presented that leads to an economic hardware implementation. The authors compare the classification performance achieved using the decomposition approach with that of a single large MLP.

Wavelet Transformation (WT) is obtained by expanding the signal on a set of functions resulting from the translation (time) and the dilatation (scale) of a so-called 'analyzing wavelet'. It provides a bidimensional representation of the signal in function of time and scale. Bipolar X, Y, Z signals were acquired using a standard, commercially available signal-averaging system, in groups of 10 patients: myocardial infarction (MI) with VT, MI without VT, and healthy subjects. WT was based on J. Morlet wavelets. Contour maps allowed the localization of short, low energy transient signals, even within the QRS complex. Patients with VT displayed the most disturbed contour plots. It is concluded that WA, combined with an adequate graphic representation, provides an accurate characterization of patients prone to VT. These preliminary results are very promising as regards the potential improvements which may be obtained by searching for an optimal analyzing wavelet.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CIC.1991.169127","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings Computers in Cardiology","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings Computers in Cardiology","pdfPath":"/iel2/385/4398/00169127.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.1991.169127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4398","startPage":"393","endPage":"396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-scale analysis of high-resolution signal-averaged surface ECG using wavelet transformation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=169127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time-scale analysis of high-resolution signal-averaged surface ECG using wavelet transformation","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sep 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/169127/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4254679","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-scale analysis of high-resolution signal-averaged surface ECG using wavelet transformation","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"00169127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028851S","chronDate":"23-26 Sep 1991","isNumber":"4398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"385","citationCount":"21","articleId":"169127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":169140,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The threshold extracts the period which include the QRS complex, and then the QRS complex is detected during this period. By using 20 series of single-channel ECG data selected from the AHA arrhythmia database, the usefulness of this algorithm was investigated, counting both numbers of false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) QRS complexes.

A method of decoupling these oscillations without compromising the benevolent effects of other control loops in that system is presented. A notch filter, located in the forward path of the negative damping signal, provides the necessary dynamic gain reduction (DGR) for switching off the detrimental signals. Relevant frequency domain analysis of the closed loop transfer function of a typical power system is provided which reflects the effect of tie-line disturbances on power angle oscillations. This leads to a restructuring of the transfer blocks in the system and the design of a DGR block that allows the decoupling of the negative damping signals. Additional insight into the effect of negative damping signals and their subsequent decoupling is provided through the examination of loop and transfer block signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/169516/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 Sep 1991","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-27 Sept. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4248640","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Decoupling negative damping signals in a power system through dynamic gain reduction measures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupling negative damping signals in a power system through dynamic gain reduction measures","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00169516.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027275S","chronDate":"22-27 Sep 1991","isNumber":"4400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"599","articleId":"169516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":169653,"authors":[{"name":"E.K.

The second method simply records all games in a large experience tree, backtracking the eventual outcomes in traditional minimax fashion. Both techniques allow a computer player to modify its behavior based on past experience, and, therefore, typically defeat static game programs. The last method explored is the use of a multilayer feedforward artificial neural network for strategy calculation. The network was trained on selected interior nodes of the experience tree using the backpropagation algorithm. The neural network strategy algorithm compares favorably with a fine-tuned hand-crafted strategy algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experience-based learning experiments using Go-Moku","publicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings 1991 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1991.169885","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings 1991 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel2/604/4401/00169885.pdf","startPage":"1405","endPage":"1410 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1991.169885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4401","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=169885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/169885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct 1991","displayDocTitle":"Experience-based learning experiments using Go-Moku","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4244097","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experience-based learning experiments using Go-Moku","confLoc":"Charlottesville, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00169885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.145453S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct 1991","isNumber":"4401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"604","citationCount":"2","articleId":"169885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":169889,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

The authors examine problems with the KSFM and propose another coding technique to overcome such difficulties. One postprocessing approach to overcoming the unused nodes problem and classified versions of the KSFM are presented and compared with the LBG algorithm. Several experimental results are presented with KSFM to achieve coding efficiency.

The results of computer simulations of applying ALOPEX to nonrecurrent networks which include any feedforward architecture, in addition to multilayer perceptrons, are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1991.169912","startPage":"1569","endPage":"1573 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings 1991 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel2/604/4401/00169912.pdf","publicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings 1991 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1991.169912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast learning algorithm for neural network applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Cost function","Application software","Stochastic processes","Computer simulation","Feedforward systems","Traveling salesman problems","Computer networks","Broadcasting","Output feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital simulation","learning systems","neural nets","parallel algorithms","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast learning algorithm","neural network","ALOPEX","nonlinear learning tasks","multilayer feedforward networks","stochastic parallel process","multilayer perception","weight changes","scalar cost function","computer simulations","nonrecurrent networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/169912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct 1991","displayDocTitle":"A fast learning algorithm for neural network applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 1991","accessionNumber":"4254473","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast learning algorithm for neural network applications","confLoc":"Charlottesville, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00169912.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028776S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct 1991","isNumber":"4401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"604","citationCount":"6","articleId":"169912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":169913,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

Based on these fault models, test shells were simulated to study the neocognitron fault tolerant ability during its learning phase and post-learning phase performance. The result of this study shows that the neocognitron will, to a certain extent, tolerate faults in its post-learning performance phase and ignore the faults in its learning phase.

Three general assumptions required for successful implementation of the method are given.

The neural network is applied to recognize the user's pattern of stereotypes dynamically and solve the reasoning conflicts. To achieve a higher interaction efficiency and simplify the maintenance of the knowledge base with these two heterogeneous reasoning processes, an object-oriented environment is proposed as an integration platform.
