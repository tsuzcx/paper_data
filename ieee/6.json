A multiple expansion method with greatly enhanced efficiency and accuracy has been achieved with the development of very fast algorithms for the computation of Schloemilch-type series. The method applies to perfectly conducting imperfectly conducting, and composite shunt posts. This approach is compared with the standard point matching technique for perfectly conducting posts. The two methods are found to be in excellent agreement in regions of overlapping applicability. A fairly wide range of computed data is utilized to develop the tools needed to incorporate the post into various microstrip circuit applications. As one application, a procedure is developed for using this post to obtain effective short-circuiting qualities over a broad frequency range. As a second application, the possibility of creating filtering devices is explored using both multiple metallic post structures and single dielectric posts.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/60003/","volume":"38","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3803751","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","displayDocTitle":"Shunt posts in microstrip transmission lines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shunt posts in microstrip transmission lines","sourcePdf":"00060003.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053061S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"29","articleId":"60003","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":60005,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

The flat gain response of these amplifiers is found to be the result of a sophisticated process in balancing the active devices' output powers.

The methodology for model extraction is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.60029","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/2184/00060029.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.60029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2184","startPage":"1755","endPage":"1760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining modal analysis and the finite-difference time-domain method in the study of dielectric waveguide problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=60029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Combining modal analysis and the finite-difference time-domain method in the study of dielectric waveguide problems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/60029/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3803777","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining modal analysis and the finite-difference time-domain method in the study of dielectric waveguide problems","sourcePdf":"00060029.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045035S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"26","articleId":"60029","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":60056,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This control method is optimum in the sense of deriving maximum output torque within the voltage and current constraints. The effects of motor parameters are examined by computer simulation. The operating limits are greatly expanded by controlling the d- and q-axis components of the armature current according to the rotor speed. The operating limits are examined considering the demagnetization of the permanent magnet. If the permanent magnet has a straight demagnetization curve, like a rare-earth permanent magnet, the PM motor can be safely operated until the demagnetizing coefficient becomes 1.0. If wide speed range or constant power operation is desirable, a permanent magnetic with a high coercivity and a linear demagnetization curve must be used for the PM motor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.60058","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","startPage":"866","endPage":"871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/2185/00060058.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00060058.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.60058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expansion of operating limits for permanent magnet motor by current vector control considering inverter capacity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permanent magnet motors","Demagnetization","Machine vector control","Inverters","Torque control","Voltage control","Computer simulation","Rotors","Permanent magnets","Coercive force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system analysis computing","digital simulation","electric current control","electric machine analysis computing","invertors","machine control","machine theory","permanent magnet motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine control","machine theory","operating limits","permanent magnet motor","current vector control","inverter capacity","output torque","computer simulation","armature current","rotor speed","demagnetization","rare-earth permanent magnet","coercivity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"Expansion of operating limits for permanent magnet motor by current vector control considering inverter capacity","volume":"26","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3814378","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/60058/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expansion of operating limits for permanent magnet motor by current vector control considering inverter capacity","sourcePdf":"00060058.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022522S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1990","isNumber":"2185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"433","articleId":"60058","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":60070,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Lett., vol.20, no.17, p.690, 1984), the author described an algorithm that computes a length-2/sup n/ discrete Fourier transform using 2/sup 2+1/-2n/sup 2/+4n-8 nontrivial (i.e. not=+or-j=+or- square root -1) complex multiplications. In the present work, it is first shown that this algorithm actually provides the attainable lower bound on the number of complex multiplications. A slight modification of the last step of this algorithm is also shown to provide the attainable lower bound on the number of real multiplications. A connection with the split-radix FFT algorithm (SRFFT) is then explained, showing that SRFFT is another variation of these optimal algorithms, where the last step is computed recursively from shorter FFTs in a suboptimal manner. Finally, once the connection between the minimal complexity and SRFFT (which is the best known practical algorithm) is understood, it provides useful information on the possibility of further improvements of the SRFFT.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.60070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/2186/00060070.pdf","startPage":"1504","endPage":"1511","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00060070.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.60070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithms meeting the lower bounds on the multiplicative complexity of length-2/sup n/ DFTs and their connection with practical algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=60070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/60070/","displayDocTitle":"Algorithms meeting the lower bounds on the multiplicative complexity of length-2/sup n/ DFTs and their connection with practical algorithms","volume":"38","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3803995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithms meeting the lower bounds on the multiplicative complexity of length-2/sup n/ DFTs and their connection with practical algorithms","sourcePdf":"00060070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037949S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"35","articleId":"60070","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":60074,"authors":[{"name":"H.B.

An expression for the threshold array signal-to-noise ratio at which beamspace MUSIC is able to resolve the emitters is obtained. The preprocessor that minimizes the resolution threshold is identified. It is demonstrated that the resolution threshold is proportional to the dimension of the noise subspace; therefore, the threshold can be reduced substantially by utilizing an appropriate beamformer to reduce the dimension of the noise subspace.

In the image analysis application, the relation between the Hermite transform and existing line/edge detection schemes is described.

Indeed, derivatives of Gaussians, which have found widespread application in feature detection over the past few years, play a central role in the Hermite analysis. It is also argued that the proposed processing scheme is in close agreement with current insight into the image processing that is carried out by the human visual system. In particular, it is demonstrated that the Hermite transform is in better agreement with human visual modeling than Gabor expansions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.60086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2186","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00060086.png","startPage":"1595","endPage":"1606","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/2186/00060086.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.60086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Hermite transform-theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Humans","Application software","Computer vision","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Image analysis","Image processing","Visual system","Pulse modulation","Digital images"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","encoding","picture processing","polynomials","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hermite transform","local processing","visual information","image coding","analysis/resynthesis system","computer vision","Gaussians","feature detection","image processing","human visual system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"The Hermite transform-theory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/60086/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"38","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3804003","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Hermite transform-theory","sourcePdf":"00060086.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05663S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"120","articleId":"60086","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":60089,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A computationally simple estimator, which was previously proposed for estimation in the absence of signal, is extended for the two models under consideration. The proposed method essentially consists of two stages of least squares estimation which is motivated by the maximum likelihood estimation. The technique is applied to the problem of detecting a signal known except for amplitude in colored nonGaussian noise Two slightly different mixing models are used, and a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), coupled with the proposed estimation scheme, is used to solve the problems.

The performance of the binary integrator from the viewpoint of order statistics is examined, and the binary integrator as an order statistic (OS) filter is described. A general analysis for OS filters in detection systems is developed and it is used to show the OS filter is a consistent and biased estimator of the quantities of the received signal distributions. The features of the OS filter and n-pulse integrator that are critical to detection performance are compared to determine the proper application of each processor. It is shown that the OS filter can be used to emphasize selective regions of the input distributions where good statistical separability between the class of input signals exist. A computer simulation is performed to illustrate the performance of binary and n-pulse integration for the detection of a white chi distributed target in white Weibull clutter and a white Rayleigh distributed target in white Rayleigh clutter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.60103","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/2187/00060103.pdf","startPage":"1722","endPage":"1732","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00060103.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.60103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Order statistic filters as postdetection processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/60103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"Order statistic filters as postdetection processors","volume":"38","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3804021","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Order statistic filters as postdetection processors","sourcePdf":"00060103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037225S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"22","articleId":"60103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":60107,"authors":[{"name":"I.S.

Chen and I.S. Reed, IEEE Trans. Aerosp. Electron. Syst., vol.AES-23, no.1, Jan. 1987) is generalized to a test which is able to detect the presence of known optical signal pattern which has nonnegligible unknown relative intensities in several signal-plus-noise bands or channels. This test and its statistics are analytically evaluated, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance improvement is analyzed. Both theoretical and computer simulation results show that the SNR improvement factor of this algorithm using multiple band scenes over the single scene of maximum SNR can be substantial. The SNR gain of this detection algorithm is compared to the previously published one. It illustrates that the generalized SNR of the test using the full data array is always greater than that of using partial data array. The database used to simulate this adaptive CFAR test is obtained from actual image scenes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.60107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/2187/00060107.pdf","startPage":"1760","endPage":"1770","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00060107.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.60107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive multiple-band CFAR detection of an optical pattern with unknown spectral distribution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/60107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive multiple-band CFAR detection of an optical pattern with unknown spectral distribution","volume":"38","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3804025","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive multiple-band CFAR detection of an optical pattern with unknown spectral distribution","sourcePdf":"00060107.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024596S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"873","articleId":"60107","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":60108,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

Using a general processor fault model, which also models an imperfect channel, the optimal design given prior failure probabilities is considered. The optimal design provides a performance bound for each system when failures may occur. It is shown that for general distributed systems, a likelihood ratio test is the optimal design for each local processor, provided failures are independent of the received observation vectors. The optimal design performs significantly better than the design that assumes no failures. It is shown that the fusion network performs better than a single centralized processor for many channels. This illustrates that, for the fusion network, the performance gained by decreasing the effect of failures outweighs the performance lost by distributing the processing. The serial network always performs worse than centralized; its performance is bounded as the number of channels increases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00060108.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/2187/00060108.pdf","startPage":"1771","endPage":"1782","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/29.60108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.60108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2187","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=60108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal design and performance of distributed signal detection systems with faults","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal design","Signal detection","Jamming","System testing","Hardware","Delay","Bandwidth","Fault detection","Design optimization","Acoustic signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","probability","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed signal detection systems","design","processor failures","general processor fault model","failure probabilities","likelihood ratio test","fusion network","serial network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/60108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"Optimal design and performance of distributed signal detection systems with faults","volume":"38","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3804026","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal design and performance of distributed signal detection systems with faults","sourcePdf":"00060108.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041904S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"13","articleId":"60108","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":60109,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Three designs of fiber-amplifier waveguides are considered: one with the same mode size as standard 1.5- mu m communication fibers (type 1); one with the same mode size as standard 1.5- mu m dispersion-shifted fibers (type 2); and one with mode size smaller than those of communication fibers (type 3). For the 1.47- mu m pump, fundamental LP/sub 01/ mode excitation is assumed, while for the lambda /sub p/=980-nm pump, concurrent excitation of LP/sub 11/ modes is considered. It is shown that excitation of higher-order pump modes at 980 nm does not significantly affect the amplifier gain performance. The effect of concentrating the Er/sup 3+/ doping near the center of the fiber core is shown to increase the amplifier gain coefficients by a factor of 1.5 to 2.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/60573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3803177","volume":"8","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design optimization for efficient erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design optimization for efficient erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00060573.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058282S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"71","articleId":"60573","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":60586,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The equations for predicting the open-loop gains for both types of reset circuits are derived and verified experimentally. It is shown that the open-loop gain characteristics of a magnetic-amplifier regulator depends on power circuit parameters, the reset-circuit parameters, and the saturable reactor parameters. Models for both continuous mode and discontinuous modes of operation that provide designers with useful tools for designing a compensation network for the feedback error amplifier are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Regulators","Transfer functions","Open loop systems","Magnetic switching","Switched-mode power supply","Equations","Magnetic circuits","Inductors","Feedback","Operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system analysis","feedback","magnetic amplifiers","poles and zeros","switched mode power supplies","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["small signal control models","poles","zeros","control loop behavior","magamp post regulators","magnetic amplifier","current reset schemes","open-loop gain","transfer function","power circuit","saturable reactor","compensation","feedback error"]}],"doi":"10.1109/63.60692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/2209/00060692.pdf","startPage":"476","endPage":"484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.60692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of control loop behavior of magamp post regulators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=60692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of control loop behavior of magamp post regulators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/60692/","volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3805339","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of control loop behavior of magamp post regulators","sourcePdf":"00060692.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045227S","chronDate":"Oct.  1990","isNumber":"2209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"21","articleId":"60692","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":60734,"authors":[{"name":"T.D.C.

The basic design concept of SIMPOW is examined, covering functional parts, power-frequency models, instantaneous value models, user-defined modeling, man-machine communication, and power-flow solution and integration procedures. Simulation stages and event handling are briefly considered. To illustrate the use of the simulation techniques described, three typical problems to which they have been applied successfully are presented in detail. They are the balancing of traction loads by means of phasewise controlled static VAr controllers, bulk power transmission by a multiterminal HVDC system, and simulation of electrical machine dynamics.

The analytic expressions presented, which involve the solution of one transcendental equation, can predict signal gains and pump absorptions in an amplifier containing an arbitrary number of pumps and signals from arbitrary directions. The gain of an amplifier was measured over a range of more than 20 dB in both pump and signal powers. The measured theoretical results agreed to within 0.5 dB.

The method is valid whenever the gain saturation by amplified spontaneous-emission noise can be neglected, which is typically the case for amplifiers with less than about 20 dB of gain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of gain in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/68.60769","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/2213/00060769.pdf","startPage":"714","endPage":"717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.60769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=60769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/60769/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of gain in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3806585","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of gain in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00060769.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036862S","chronDate":"Oct.  1990","isNumber":"2213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"185","articleId":"60769","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":60781,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

For amplifiers with equal TE-TM gains, the TE and TM gains remain equal at high temperature. The measurements of the amplified spontaneous power show similar similar characteristics. More importantly, less polarization-sensitive gain characteristics can be obtained with some decrease in maximum gain by raising the operating temperature.

It is shown that there is a nonlinear degradation in the signal processing gain as a function of the input SNR that results from the statistical properties of the adaptive filter weights.

Yee, ibid., vol. AP-14, p.302-7, 1966) is presented. To introduce the technique, linear apertures that are electrically narrow in both width and depth are discussed. The method incorporates an independent time-marching solution for the aperture problem into the FDTD code so that the aperture formally does not exist within the main FDTD mesh. A feedback scheme is introduced so that full exterior and interior coupling is included in the aperture solution. The technique is particularly useful for the analysis of apertures that are narrow both in width and depth with regard to the FDTD spatial cell. Previous thin-slot methods are shown to significantly underestimate the transverse gap electric field for this case, and an explanation for this is provided with the aid of the hybrid algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.60983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/2221/00060983.pdf","startPage":"1943","endPage":"1950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.60983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid thin-slot algorithm for the analysis of narrow apertures in finite-difference time-domain calculations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=60983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/60983/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid thin-slot algorithm for the analysis of narrow apertures in finite-difference time-domain calculations","volume":"38","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3847563","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid thin-slot algorithm for the analysis of narrow apertures in finite-difference time-domain calculations","sourcePdf":"00060983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045603S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"43","articleId":"60983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":60990,"authors":[{"name":"H.

To support these findings, the frequency spectra of diastolic heart sounds are compared before and after angioplastic surgery. Since the low-level sounds associated with partially occluded coronary arteries are contaminated with considerable background noise, traditional FFT analysis may not produce accurate frequency spectra. In a previous study using the same data, no significant differences were found in the diastolic heart sounds before and after angioplastic surgery. In this study, three eigenvector methods (Pisarenko, MUSIC, and Minimum-Norm) have been selected to generate the frequency spectra because of their higher resolution, particularly in the presence of noise. Although the Pisarenko method produced spurious zeros and could not be used, the other two methods produced spectra showing, in most cases, a marked decrease in high-frequency spectral components following angioplasty.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.61035","startPage":"1095","endPage":"1104","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/2223/00061035.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.61035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noninvasive detection of coronary stenoses before and after angioplasty using eigenvector methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Angioplasty","Frequency","Arteries","Heart","Surgery","Blood flow","Background noise","Multiple signal classification","Acoustic noise","Noise generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioacoustics","cardiology","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noninvasive detection","coronary stenoses","angioplasty","eigenvector methods","turbulent blood flow","frequency spectra","diastolic heart sounds","Pisarenko method","spurious zeros"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Angioplasty, Transluminal, Percutaneous Coronary","Coronary Disease","Coronary Disease","Heart Sounds","Humans","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61035/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Noninvasive detection of coronary stenoses before and after angioplasty using eigenvector methods","volume":"37","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3837147","pubMedId":"2276757","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noninvasive detection of coronary stenoses before and after angioplasty using eigenvector methods","sourcePdf":"61035.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038484S","chronDate":"Nov.  1990","isNumber":"2223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"72","articleId":"61035","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":61042,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

Previous implementations require approximately 4*2/sup F/ words for F bits of precision in the fraction. The author shows how to reduce the size of the lookup table to fewer than (18+F)*2/sup F/2/ words. The key to this is the use of a linear approximation of the nonlinear functions stored in the lookup tables. The functions involved are highly nonlinear in some regions, so variable size regions are used for the approximation. The replacement of the F exponential dependence on the number of words by F/2 allows roughly 50% more bits of fractional precision to be obtained for a given amount of ROM. The architecture is mathematically analyzed, yielding explicit expressions for all design parameters. The approach is illustrated with an example logarithmic addition and subtraction unit using 32-b words with 30-b exponents containing 22 fractional bits. A factor of 118 reduction in table size compared to previous techniques is achieved for this example.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/2224/00061042.pdf","startPage":"1325","endPage":"1336","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.61042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.61042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2224","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=61042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An architecture for addition and subtraction of long word length numbers in the logarithmic number system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear approximation","Table lookup","Read only memory","Digital arithmetic","Digital signal processors","Computer errors","Councils","Programmable logic arrays","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","long word length numbers","logarithmic number system","addition","subtraction","lookup tables","linear approximation","nonlinear functions","design parameters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","displayDocTitle":"An architecture for addition and subtraction of long word length numbers in the logarithmic number system","volume":"39","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3837165","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An architecture for addition and subtraction of long word length numbers in the logarithmic number system","sourcePdf":"00061042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037835S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"50","articleId":"61042","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":61045,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The author shows that the suggested expedient of using a slightly higher sampling rate does not suffice to give a convergent sampling expansion for the sinusoid and that the equations used to establish this result give rise to a number of classical series summations usually evaluated by means of contour integration. The Shannon sampling theorem itself can be employed to yield interesting closed-form summations.

Approximate expressions for the likelihood function, the MAP estimator, and the MMSE estimator that becomes increasingly accurate as the per-unit-time density of superimposed filter responses becomes small are obtained. The optimal MAP estimator takes the form of a cascade of linear and memoryless nonlinear components. For smooth point process intensities, the performance of the MAP estimator is studied via local bias and local variance. A rate distortion type lower bound on the MSE of any estimator of time delay is then derived by identification of a communications channel that accounts for the mapping from time delay to observation process. Results of numerical studies of estimator performance are presented. Based on the examples considered it is concluded: (1) the small-error MSE of the nonlinear MAP estimator can be significantly better than the small-error MSE of the optimal linear estimator: (2) the rate distortion lower bound can be significantly tighter than the Poisson limited bounds determined in previous studies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61107/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","volume":"37","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3857697","displayDocTitle":"Timing estimation for a filtered Poisson process in Gaussian noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing estimation for a filtered Poisson process in Gaussian noise","sourcePdf":"00061107.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034803S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"31","articleId":"61107","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":61108,"authors":[{"name":"P.S.

The theory developed is different from traditional approaches to analyzing delay because the model used to describe the entry of data into the network is nonprobabilistic. It is supposed that the data stream entered into the network by any given user satisfies burstiness constraints. A data stream is said to satisfy a burstiness constraint if the quantity of data from the stream contained in any interval of time is less than a value that depends on the length of the interval. Several network elements are defined that can be used as building blocks to model a wide variety of communication networks. Each type of network element is analyzed by assuming that the traffic entering it satisfies bursting constraints. Under this assumption, bounds are obtained on delay and buffering requirements for the network element; burstiness constraints satisfied by the traffic that exits the element are derived.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.61109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2227/00061109.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.61109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2227","startPage":"114","endPage":"131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A calculus for network delay.

A method to analyze the flow of data in a network consisting of the interconnection of network elements is presented. Assuming the data that enters the network satisfies burstiness constraints, burstiness constraints are derived for traffic flowing between network elements. These derived constraints imply bounds on network delay and buffering requirements. By example, it is shown that the use of regulator elements within the network can reduce maximum network delay. It is also found that such a use of regulator elements can enlarge the throughput region where finite bounds for delay are found. Finally, it is shown how regulator elements connected in series can be used to enforce general burstiness constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3847587","displayDocTitle":"A calculus for network delay.

Consideration is given to (n,e,L) codes, which correct all sets of e or fewer errors in a block of n bits under list-of-L decoding. New geometric relations between the number of errors corrected under list-of-1 decoding and the (larger) number corrected under list-of-L decoding of the same code lead to new lower bounds on the maximum rate of (n,e,L) codes.

The new bounds are stronger for small n, but weaker for fixed e/n in the limit of large n and L than known random coding bounds.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/18.61123","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2227/00061123.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.61123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2227","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"5","endPage":"12","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Error-correcting codes for list decoding","volume":"37","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3847581","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61123/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-correcting codes for list decoding","sourcePdf":"00061123.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029262S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"79","articleId":"61123","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":61125,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In this study, the problem of efficient estimation of the Class A parameters for small sample sizes is considered. The proposed estimator is based on the EM algorithm, a two-step iterative estimation technique that is ideally suited for the Class A estimation problem since the observations can be readily treated as incomplete data. For the single-parameter estimation problem, a closed-form expression for the estimator is obtained. Furthermore, for the single-parameter estimation problem, it is shown that the sequence of estimates obtained via the EM algorithm converges, and a characterization of the point to which the sequence converges is given. In particular, it is shown that if the limit point of this convergent sequence is an interior point of the parameter set of interest, then it must be a stationary point of the traditional likelihood function. In addition, for both the single-parameter and two-parameter estimation problems, the small-sample-size performance of the proposed EM algorithm is examined via an extensive simulation study.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.61127","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2227/00061127.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.61127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"60","endPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient estimation of Class A noise parameters via the EM algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=61127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","displayDocTitle":"Efficient estimation of Class A noise parameters via the EM algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61127/","volume":"37","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3847585","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient estimation of Class A noise parameters via the EM algorithm","sourcePdf":"00061127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037736S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"90","articleId":"61127","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":61130,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Observations on the geometric structure of these quantizers are made, which have an important implication on the encoding complexity. For the squared-error distortion measure, it is shown that an operation equivalent to a Euclidean distance measurement with respect to an appropriately defined set of points (used to identify the encoding regions) can be used to perform the encoding. This implies that the encoding complexity is proportional to the number of encoding regions. It is then demonstrated that for very noisy channels and a heavily correlated source, when the codebook size is large, the number of encoding regions is considerably smaller than the codebook size-implying a reduction in encoding complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.61130","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2227/00061130.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.61130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance and complexity of channel-optimized vector quantizers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=61130","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61130/","displayDocTitle":"On the performance and complexity of channel-optimized vector quantizers","volume":"37","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3847588","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance and complexity of channel-optimized vector quantizers","sourcePdf":"00061130.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059974S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"210","articleId":"61130","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":61131,"authors":[{"name":"T.

An M-ary modulation code is first represented as a code with symbols from the integer group S/sub M-PSK/=(0,1,2,---,M-1) under modulo-M addition. Then the linear structure of block M-PSK modulation codes over S/sub M-PSK/ with respect to modulo-M vector addition is defined, and conditions are derived under which a block M-PSK modulation code is linear. Once the linear structure is developed, the phase symmetry of block M-PSK modulation codes is studied. In particular, a necessary and sufficient condition for a block M-PSK modulation code that is linear as a binary code to be invariant under 2/sup h/180 degrees /M phase rotation, for 1<or=h<or=l is derived.

Two compatible forms of the superquadric potential function are introduced: one for obstacle avoidance, and another for obstacle approach. The avoidance and approach potentials are implemented in simulations. In these simulations the end effector of the manipulator experiences an attractive force from a global spherical well, while the end effector and each of the links experience repulsive forces from all of the objects.

The received signal in this channel is composed of a specular signal, a diffuse signal, and white Gaussian noise; hence, the composite signal is fading and has a Rician envelope. The error probability is shown to depend on the following system parameters: (1) the signal-to-noise ratio; (2) the ratio of powers in the specular and diffuse signal components; (3) the normalized frequency deviation; (4) the normalized Doppler frequency; (5) the maximum normalized Doppler frequency; (6) the correlation function of the diffuse component, which depends on the normalized Doppler frequency and the type of the antenna; (7) the number of symbols; and (8) the normalized time delay between the specular and diffuse component (t/sub d//T) where 1/T is the symbol rate. Except for T/sub d//T, all normalized parameters are the ratios of the parameter value and symbol rate. The Doppler frequency depends on the velocity of the vehicle and the carrier frequency. The error probability is computed as a function of the various parameters.

The performance criterion is the rate of information transfer through the mobile radio channel. In addition to packet size, the information rate depends on: the speed of the mobile terminal, the channel bit rate, the size of the packet header, and the fade margin of the modulation and coding techniques. In particular, attention is focused on line rates of 16 kb/s and 256 kb/s (which are representative of the rates proposed for digital mobile radio systems in North America and Europe, respectively). At 16 kb/s, the optimum packet size is approximately 17 B (8.5-ms duration). At 256 kb/s, maximum throughput occurs when the packet contains about 48 B (1.5-ms duration). The precise optimum depends on vehicle speed, header size, and fade margin. The optimum packets are considerably shorter than the 125-B packets customarily used in terrestrial and satellite systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet data transmission over mobile radio channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.61335","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/2232/00061335.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.61335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2232","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=61335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61335/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Packet data transmission over mobile radio channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1989","accessionNumber":"3606534","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet data transmission over mobile radio channels","sourcePdf":"00061335.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033287S","chronDate":"May 1989","isNumber":"2232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"71","articleId":"61335","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":61337,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.I.

The system's performance is dramatically improved by deploying some degree of fade tracking capability over fading channels. Further quality enhancement accrues by using appropriate mapping between the SBC speech codec and the Gray coded QAM words. Various BCH codes are utilized to adequately match the error-correcting power to the perceptual importance of the SBC bits. One of the proposed systems operates at 7 kBd and yields good communications-quality speech for channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in excess of 20 dB and encounters a maximum overall system delay of 55.125 ms. A more complex arrangement uses second-order switched diversity to reduce the channel SNR required to around 16 dB and the transmission rate to 5 kBd when the vehicular speed is 30 mph while the system delay is unchanged at 55.125 ms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","volume":"39","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3847967","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A subband coding, BCH coding, and 16-QAM system for mobile radio speech communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A subband coding, BCH coding, and 16-QAM system for mobile radio speech communications","sourcePdf":"00061354.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048057S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"35","articleId":"61354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":61356,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The second feature consists of differences in building construction and design, and the presence of foliage. These sources of variation are independent and act in cascade, so that the received signal is a product of the corresponding coefficients.

The system is impaired by laser phase noise as well as by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). A receiver structure especially designed to mitigate the effects of phase noise in the presence of AWGN is assumed. This special receiver structure requires a wider-band front-end IF filter than would be required for a phase-noise-free signal. The results, computed for several different coding schemes, indicate that the benefits of coding are large and the costs are small. For a linewidth-to-bit-rate ratio ( beta T) of 0.64 (for example, 45 Mb/s and 29 MHz linewidth), a half-rate binary code that can correct 3 bit errors provides a 50% reduction in the required IF filter bandwidth (and, therefore, the required IF) and about 5 dB of reduction in required laser power. The benefits of coding are greatest under high- beta T conditions, corresponding to low bit rates where coders and decoders are most practical to implement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.61366","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2234/00061366.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.61366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2234","startPage":"1301","endPage":"1307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding of optical on-off keying signals impaired by phase noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=61366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coding of optical on-off keying signals impaired by phase noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61366/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3825824","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding of optical on-off keying signals impaired by phase noise","sourcePdf":"00061366.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030102S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","articleId":"61366","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":61369,"authors":[{"name":"K.R.

These techniques offer a potential performance improvement over conventional equalization techniques such as decision feedback equalization (DFE). Stationary and cyclostationary NEXT noise models are described. The theoretical performance obtainable from a Viterbi algorithm receiver with stationary white Gaussian noise, stationary NEXT, and cyclostationary NEXT noise models is estimated, and the reduced-state decision feedback sequence estimation and M algorithms are reviewed. It is shown that the improvement can be especially significant in the presence of cyclostationary crosstalk because of the freedom that sequence estimation receivers afford in the choice of receiver sampling phase. This advantage is evaluated for Viterbi algorithm receivers. By simulation of two practical reduced-state sequence estimation receivers, it is demonstrated that, in the presence of cyclostationary crosstalk, a substantial increase in maximum loop range (or equivalently, maximum bit rate) may be achievable compared to conventional DFE equalization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.61378","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2234/00061378.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.61378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2234","startPage":"1367","endPage":"1374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequence estimation techniques for digital subscriber loop transmission with crosstalk interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=61378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sequence estimation techniques for digital subscriber loop transmission with crosstalk interference","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61378/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3825833","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequence estimation techniques for digital subscriber loop transmission with crosstalk interference","sourcePdf":"00061378.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047632S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"15","articleId":"61378","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":61381,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This is used to define an augmented (larger multiplicity) trellis code whose distance measure is the conventional squared Euclidean distance typical of conventional trellis-coded modulation on the AWGN. Such an augmented multiple trellis code is a convenient mathematical tool for simplifying the analysis. Results are obtained by a combination of analysis and computer simulation.

The multiuser interference over a packet in the network is modeled as a compound Gaussian multivariate random variable for moderate to large values of the processing gain. The conditional variance is dependent on the number of users and their interference powers. The method works for any interference with statistics of the block interference having a spherically symmetric distribution. The best performance results, in terms of the expected total interference power, are obtained for the case of a large number of interferers with comparable interference powers. As the number of interferers approaches infinity, the performance is the same as that for Gaussian noise. For a small number of interferers, the block error probability curve is broader than that for Gaussian noise. For small values of SNR, the probability of error is smaller than that corresponding to Gaussian noise, and for large values of SNR it is larger. Modifications to the basic direct-sequence scheme that improve performance in the case of one strong interferer are suggested.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.61388","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2234/00061388.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.61388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2234","startPage":"1475","endPage":"1482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference modeling in a direct-sequence spread-spectrum packet radio network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=61388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference modeling in a direct-sequence spread-spectrum packet radio network","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61388/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3848116","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference modeling in a direct-sequence spread-spectrum packet radio network","sourcePdf":"00061388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040053S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"61","articleId":"61388","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":61389,"authors":[{"name":"C.D.

Conditions are described for which these models can be used to compute upper and lower bounds on the codeword and packet error probabilities. It is shown that if the ratio of the number of interfering packets to the number of frequency slots is held constant, hits in the asynchronous frequency-hop network are asymptotically independent in the limit as the number of frequency slots increases.

It is shown that decoding degradation can be accurately approximated by relatively simple integrals involving the phase noise structure function (the latter obtained directly from the phase spectrum). Examples with reported crystal and cesium oscillator noise are presented. The key phase noise parameters are the spectral bandwidth relative to the bit rate, and the gain level of the phase noise (the latter being dependent on the carrier frequency to which the oscillator is multiplied). Separate results are derived for FSK and DPSK, but the order of the degradation is comparable in both cases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Digital communication","Frequency shift keying","Oscillators","Bandwidth","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","Decoding","Degradation","Phase detection","Differential phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","digital communication systems","frequency shift keying","noise","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crystal oscillator noise","BFSK","noncoherent digital communications","oscillator phase noise","noncoherent data detection","binary frequency-shift keying","FSK","DPSK","decoding error probability","phase noise spectra","decoding degradation","cesium oscillator noise","spectral bandwidth","gain level"]}],"doi":"10.1109/26.61395","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2234/00061395.pdf","startPage":"1539","endPage":"1548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.61395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of phase noise on noncoherent digital communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=61395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The effect of phase noise on noncoherent digital communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61395/","volume":"38","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3848123","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of phase noise on noncoherent digital communications","sourcePdf":"00061395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048024S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","articleId":"61395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":61397,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The distribution of packet lengths and the patterns of packet interarrival times are interpreted for the three protocols that carry significant traffic: the transmission control protocol (character traffic), the network disk protocol (paging traffic), and the network file system protocol (remote file access traffic). The two latter protocols account for 68% of the packets and 94% of the data bytes on the network.

A simplified model of the EKF joint estimator is considered for analysis purposes.

This implementation is based on digitizing a receiving signal after a low-frequency IF amplifier and performing all demodulation functions using digital signal processing techniques. Demodulation with very low overhead for TDMA is made possible by storing a burst in memory. A novel forward loop plus backward loop structure performs carrier recovery. Symbol-timing and carrier-frequency-offset estimations are performed by block processes, using the error signal resulting from differential demodulation. Bursts as short as 32 symbols can be demodulated without overhead. Since the demodulator is entirely digital and has the potential for low-power VLSI implementation, it is suitable for a portable radio system. Other advantages of this implementation include the availability of a channel quality measure derived from symbol timing estimation and the possibility of providing differential detection when it is desirable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00061461.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2235/00061461.pdf","startPage":"1886","endPage":"1892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.61461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.61461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=61461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-overhead symbol timing and carrier recovery for TDMA portable radio systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Time division multiple access","Demodulation","Frequency estimation","Hardware","Frequency synchronization","Analytical models","Signal processing","Digital signal processing","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","demodulators","mobile radio systems","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low overhead symbol timing","simulation results","carrier recovery","portable radio systems","experimental results","digital coherent burst demodulator","time-division multiple-access","TDMA","short bursts","low-frequency IF amplifier","digital signal processing","forward loop","backward loop","carrier-frequency-offset","block processes","error signal","differential demodulation","low-power VLSI","channel quality measure","symbol timing estimation","differential detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61461/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"Low-overhead symbol timing and carrier recovery for TDMA portable radio systems","volume":"38","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3848167","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-overhead symbol timing and carrier recovery for TDMA portable radio systems","sourcePdf":"00061461.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030122S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"48","articleId":"61461","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":61463,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Phase and frequency estimation are obtained through a closed-loop phase tracking model. The performance of the maximum-likelihood model under high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is established in terms of probability density functions of the phase increment processes in space and time.

With the proposed generalized type-II hybrid ARQ strategy, the throughput increases as the starting coding rage increases, and as the channel degrades, it tends to merge with the throughput of rate 1/2 type-II hybrid ARQ schemes with code combining, thus allowing the system to be flexible and adaptive to channel conditions, even under wide noise variations and severe degradations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61474/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","volume":"38","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"3848175","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Generalized type II hybrid ARQ scheme using punctured convolutional coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized type II hybrid ARQ scheme using punctured convolutional coding","sourcePdf":"00061474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078144S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"143","articleId":"61474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":61477,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The four-parameter distribution, which combines amplitude scintillations and rain fade within an up/down link system, is presented. Also presented are the degradation (and improvement) of bit error rate (BER) in the presence of amplitude scintillations, thus complementing the flat fade effect due to rain only. By implementation of adaptive communication systems, a more efficient channel capacity utilization is possible. The concepts and the use of novel analytical expressions combining a log-normal model of rain fade with a Moulsley-Vilar distribution for scintillations are illustrated. These are then applied to a very-small-aperture terminal (VSAT) example of a 29/19-GHz digital communications link through the Olympus satellite using M-ary phase shift keying (PSK) modulation schemes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.61477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.61477","endPage":"1965","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00061477.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2236/00061477.pdf","startPage":"1958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum utilization of the channel capacity of a satellite link in the presence of amplitude scintillations and rain attenuation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61477/","displayDocTitle":"Optimum utilization of the channel capacity of a satellite link in the presence of amplitude scintillations and rain attenuation","volume":"38","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"3848178","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum utilization of the channel capacity of a satellite link in the presence of amplitude scintillations and rain attenuation","sourcePdf":"00061477.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029334S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"54","articleId":"61477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":61478,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In the satellite mobile channel, the input signal is the sum of a direct component, a diffuse component, and white Gaussian noise. The receiver is either with or without decision feedback, and the decision region is optimized for 2-b DPD to minimize the error probability. The error probability for GMSK is computed as a function of signal-to-noise ratio and other system or channel parameters (Doppler frequency, Gaussian filter bandwidth, ratio of powers in the direct and diffuse signal components, etc.). It is shown that decision feedback is more effective for GMSK with narrow bandwidth. The 2-b DPD is superior to the 1-b DPD for low Doppler frequencies and signal-to-noise ratios. For practical vehicle velocities and bit rates, a 2-b DPD with decision feedback outperforms all other analyzed schemes when the signal-to-noise ratio is low.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"1980","endPage":"1986","doi":"10.1109/26.61480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.61480","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2236/00061480.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00061480.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GMSK with differential phase detection in the satellite mobile channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","displayDocTitle":"GMSK with differential phase detection in the satellite mobile channel","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3848181","volume":"38","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GMSK with differential phase detection in the satellite mobile channel","sourcePdf":"00061480.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052608S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"44","articleId":"61480","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":61481,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.B.

In applications where time is unslotted, the symbol-error probability is not the same for each symbol because the number of interfering users varies throughout the packet duration. Packet-error probability for such systems is evaluated by first enumerating all possible interference states and then averaging the packet-error probability associated with each of these states. The use of Reed-Solomon error-control coding is assumed. The computational task for this evaluation is enormous. Therefore, upper bounds and an alternate less-detailed approximate model are developed for easier computation. This approximate model generates results that are very close to those obtained using the authors' first model (1988) for the cases in which those results are computable. The conclusions of this study confirm the observation, originally made elsewhere, that the widely used threshold-based model for other-user interference is not an accurate one.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.61481","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2236/00061481.pdf","startPage":"1987","endPage":"1993","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00061481.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.61481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet-error probability analysis for unslotted FH-CDMA systems with error-control coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=61481","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61481/","displayDocTitle":"Packet-error probability analysis for unslotted FH-CDMA systems with error-control coding","volume":"38","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3848182","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet-error probability analysis for unslotted FH-CDMA systems with error-control coding","sourcePdf":"00061481.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099875S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","articleId":"61481","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":61531,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

To model a sequence of information-bearing acoustic feature vectors which has been extracted from the speech waveform via some appropriate front-end signal processing, a speech recognizer basically faces two alternatives: (1) assign a multivariate probability distribution directly to the stream of vectors, or (2) use a time-synchronous labeling acoustic processor to perform vector quantization on this stream, and assign a multinomial probability distribution to the output of the vector quantizer. With a few exceptions, these two methods have traditionally been given separate treatment. A class of very general hidden Markov models which can accommodate feature vector sequences lying either in a discrete or in a continuous space is considered; the new class allows one to represent the prototypes in an assumption-limited, yet convenient way, as tied mixtures of simple multivariate densities. Speech recognition experiments, reported for two (5000- and 20000-word vocabulary) office correspondence tasks, demonstrate some of the benefits associated with this technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/2238/00061531.pdf","startPage":"2033","endPage":"2045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tied mixture continuous parameter modeling for speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/29.61531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.61531","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=61531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61531/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Tied mixture continuous parameter modeling for speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3848271","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tied mixture continuous parameter modeling for speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00061531.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056674S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"103","articleId":"61531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":61538,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

A number of results have been recently presented by the authors on the statistical performance of the multiple signal characterization (MUSIC) and the maximum likelihood (ML) estimators for the above problems. This work extends those results in several directions. First, it establishes that in the class of weighted MUSIC estimators, the unweighted MUSIC achieves the best performance (i.e. the minimum variance of estimation errors), in large samples. Next, it derives the covariance matrix of the ML estimator and presents detailed analytic studies of the statistical efficiency of MUSIC and ML estimators. These studies include performance comparisons of MUSIC and MLE with each other, as well as with the ultimate performance corresponding to the Cramer-Rao bound. Finally, some numerical examples are given which provide a more quantitative study of performance for the problem of finding two directions with uniform linear sensor arrays.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00061541.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/2238/00061541.pdf","doi":"10.1109/29.61541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.61541","startPage":"2140","endPage":"2150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MUSIC, maximum likelihood, and Cramer-Rao bound: further results and comparisons","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61541/","displayDocTitle":"MUSIC, maximum likelihood, and Cramer-Rao bound: further results and comparisons","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"3848281","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MUSIC, maximum likelihood, and Cramer-Rao bound: further results and comparisons","sourcePdf":"00061541.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0368S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"347","articleId":"61541","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":61542,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The main feature of this approach is that the scheduling and resource allocation can be done at compile time. It is made possible by the fact that most signal processing algorithms have constant data flow. The resulting hardware is much simpler because no overhead is needed for the real-time scheduling, as in usual data flow systems. Therefore a realization can easily be obtained using either commercially available components or VLSI technology. The proposed system comprises four main components: (1) a vector oriented data flow compiler for the translation of a high-level language description of algorithms into a data flow graph; (2) a critical path analysis for the evaluation of the minimal computation time of the algorithm, where block scheduling is assumed; (3) a schedule optimization for the determination of the minimal computation time under limited resources, not taking into account limitations imposed by the interconnection structure and temporary storage; and (4) a combined schedule optimization and resource allocation that maps a signal processing application onto a given hardware configuration and generates a formal microprogram.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.61543","startPage":"2162","endPage":"2173","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.61543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2238","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/2238/00061543.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A data flow technique for the efficient design of a class of parallel non-data flow signal processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61543/","displayDocTitle":"A data flow technique for the efficient design of a class of parallel non-data flow signal processors","volume":"38","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3848283","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data flow technique for the efficient design of a class of parallel non-data flow signal processors","sourcePdf":"00061543.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049937S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"1","articleId":"61543","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":61544,"authors":[{"name":"R.N.

The method is completely passive, requiring only the sensing of transmitted radiance of reflected light through a polarizing filter positioned in multiple orientations in front of a camera sensor. Precise positioning of lighting is not required. An advantage of using a polarization-based method for material classification is its immunity to color variations, which so commonly exist on uniform material samples. A simple polarization-reflectance model, called the Fresnel reflectance model, is developed. The fundamental assumptions are that the diffuse component of reflection is completely unpolarized and that the polarization state of the specular component of reflection is dictated by the Fresnel reflection coefficients. The material classification method presented results axiomatically from the Fresnel reflectance model, by estimating the polarization Fresnel ratio. No assumptions are required about the functional form of the diffuse and specular components of reflection. The method is demonstrated on some common objects consisting of metal and dielectric parts.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarization-based material classification from specular reflection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.61705","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/2246/00061705.pdf","startPage":"1059","endPage":"1071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.61705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2246","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=61705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61705/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","displayDocTitle":"Polarization-based material classification from specular reflection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3837626","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization-based material classification from specular reflection","sourcePdf":"00061705.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036532S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"173","articleId":"61705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":61706,"authors":[{"name":"H.-C.

The algorithm first calculates the curvature function from the digitized image of an object. The points of local maxima and minima extracted from the smooth curvature are used as control points to segment the boundary and to guide the boundary-matching procedure. The boundary-matching procedure considers two shapes at a time, one shape from the template databank, and the other from the object being classified. The procedure tries to match the control points in the unknown shape to those of a shape from the template databank, and estimates the translation, rotation, and scaling factors to be used to normalize the boundary of the unknown shape. The chamfer 3/4 distance transformation and a partial distance measurement scheme constitute the final step in measuring the similarity between the two shapes. The unknown shape is assigned to the class corresponding to the minimum distance. The algorithm has been successfully tested on partial shapes using two sets of data, one with sharp corners and the other with curve segments. This algorithm not only is computationally simple, but also works reasonably well in the presence of a moderate amount of noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/2246/00061706.pdf","startPage":"1072","endPage":"1079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.61706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.61706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2246","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=61706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial shape classification using contour matching in distance transformation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape control","Shape measurement","Image segmentation","Distance measurement","Testing","Noise shaping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","picture processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial shape classification","local minima","boundary segmentation","translation estimation","rotation estimation","scaling factor estimation","boundary normalisation","contour matching","distance transformation","2D shapes","curvature function","digitized image","local maxima","boundary-matching","chamfer 3/4 distance transformation","partial distance measurement","sharp corners","curve segments","noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","displayDocTitle":"Partial shape classification using contour matching in distance transformation","volume":"12","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3837627","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial shape classification using contour matching in distance transformation","sourcePdf":"00061706.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029554S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"146","articleId":"61706","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":61712,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.T.

The problem arises in automatic inspection where orientation can be detected from printed text but there is no knowledge of the content of the text. This is a high-dimensional classification problem, and there is a requirement for highly accurate detection and rapid processing. The typical multilayer threshold networks are seen as unsuitable, and the optimal Bayesian detector is derived and found to have the highly parallel structure of a feedforward network. The learning vector quantization neural network method of T. Kohonen (1988) is also applied. Experimental results, comparisons, and a complete implementation are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61712/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3837633","volume":"12","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Neural network techniques for object orientation detection.

A 16-pixel step template located 63.2% of the border points within 2 mm of the manual border. Median prefiltering of the images reduced detection accuracy by 3% to 6%. No statistically significant difference in accuracy was found between longer and shorter templates or between data-derived and step templates. Compared to manual estimates, computer generated cross-sectional area determinations were correlated with a coefficient of 0.93.

The simulation was tested by imaging monoenergetic point sources of Tc-99m, Cr-51, and Sr-85 (140, 320, and 514 keV, respectively) on a General Electric Star Cam with low-energy, general-purpose, and medium-energy collimators.

The mechanism of device degradation may be attributed to the metastable creation of midgap states within the polysilicon channel, as opposed to gate dielectric charge trapping or interface state generation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel1/55/2250/00061785.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","doi":"10.1109/55.61785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.61785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=61785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mechanism of device degradation in n- and p-channel polysilicon TFTs by electrical stressing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Thin film transistors","Stress","Dielectric substrates","Fabrication","Threshold voltage","Amorphous silicon","Leakage current","Metastasis","Dielectric devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier mobility","electron traps","elemental semiconductors","hole traps","impurity electron states","leakage currents","silicon","thin film transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydrogenated polycrystalline Si","n-channel device","device degradation","p-channel","electrical stressing","polysilicon thin-film transistors","off-state","accumulation conditions","on-state stress","threshold voltage","trap state density","subthreshold sharpness","field-effect mobility","leakage current","metastable creation","midgap states","polysilicon channel","Si:H"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/61785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1990","displayDocTitle":"Mechanism of device degradation in n- and p-channel polysilicon TFTs by electrical stressing","volume":"11","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3653471","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanism of device degradation in n- and p-channel polysilicon TFTs by electrical stressing","sourcePdf":"00061785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034159S","chronDate":"April  1990","isNumber":"2250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"108","articleId":"61785","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":61971,"authors":[{"name":"K.-K.

The numerical results are in qualitative agreement with recent experiments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.62015","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/2257/00062015.pdf","startPage":"875","endPage":"877","doi":"10.1109/68.62015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplification of ultrashort solitons in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Amplification of ultrashort solitons in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","volume":"2","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3850688","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62015/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplification of ultrashort solitons in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00062015.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032044S","chronDate":"Dec.  1990","isNumber":"2257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"70","articleId":"62015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":62016,"authors":[{"name":"K.-Y.

It is shown that waveform distortion is suppressed by transmission at a little longer wavelength than zero-dispersion wavelength for an LD direct modulated signal. This is because the amplitude modulation component induced by LD direct modulation is canceled by waveform distortion resulting from FM-AM conversion. This cancellation occurs most effectively when the phase difference between AM and FM of LD direct modulation is pi /2, which is expected for high-speed modulation. Since waveform distortion is less in the case of a wide frequency range, waveform distortion for an NRZ signal is also considered to be suppressed by transmission at a little longer wavelength than zero-dispersion wavelength.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Amplitude modulation","Frequency modulation","Phase modulation","Frequency shift keying","Chirp modulation","Chromatic dispersion","Optical receivers","Optical modulation","Degradation","Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","frequency modulation","light emitting devices","optical communication equipment","optical links","optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonreturn-to-zero","light diode","amplitude modulation","LD direct modulation","FM signal transmission","sinusoidally frequency/phase modulated signals","zero-dispersion wavelength","waveform distortion","amplitude modulation","FM-AM conversion","phase difference","high-speed modulation","wide frequency range","NRZ signal"]}],"doi":"10.1109/68.62033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/2257/00062033.pdf","startPage":"929","endPage":"931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.62033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of amplitude modulation induced by LD direct modulation on FM signal transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=62033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Influence of amplitude modulation induced by LD direct modulation on FM signal transmission","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62033/","volume":"2","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3871671","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of amplitude modulation induced by LD direct modulation on FM signal transmission","sourcePdf":"00062033.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022088S","chronDate":"Dec.  1990","isNumber":"2257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"7","articleId":"62033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":62047,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This trend in SRAM design stems mainly from the fact that AC current becomes the most significant fraction of the total current. Accordingly, the design described here employs a purely static path through the entire SRAM, with no requirement of ATD at any point. The resulting DC current is countered with a combined strategy of array subdivision, small-signal techniques, and active preamplification at key points in the data path.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.62123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2262/00062123.pdf","startPage":"1047","endPage":"1056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.62123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=62123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"8-ns CMOS 64 K*4 and 256 K*1 SRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62123/","displayDocTitle":"8-ns CMOS 64 K*4 and 256 K*1 SRAMs","volume":"25","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3814238","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"8-ns CMOS 64 K*4 and 256 K*1 SRAMs","sourcePdf":"00062123.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073079S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"4","articleId":"62123","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":62124,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The RAM can obtain a much larger data-retention margin than a conventional high-resistive load-type well by using the PMOS TFT as a memory cell load. An internal voltage down-converter architecture with an external supply voltage-level sensor not only realizes a highly reliable 0.5- mu m MOS transistor operation but also a sufficiently low standby-power dissipation characteristic for data battery-backup application. A self-aligned equalized level sensing scheme can minimize the sensing delay for a local sense amplifier to drive a large load capacitance of a global sensing bus line. The RAM is fabricated using a 0.5 mu m, triple-poly, and double-aluminum with dual gate-oxide-thickness CMOS process technology. The RAM operates under a single 5-V supply voltage with 23-ns typical address access time and 20- and 70-mA operation current at 10 and 40 MHz, respectively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.62128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2262/00062128.pdf","startPage":"1082","endPage":"1092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.62128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 4-Mb CMOS SRAM with a PMOS thin-film-transistor load cell","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62128/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"A 4-Mb CMOS SRAM with a PMOS thin-film-transistor load cell","volume":"25","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3814243","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 4-Mb CMOS SRAM with a PMOS thin-film-transistor load cell","sourcePdf":"00062128.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07877S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"12","articleId":"62128","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":62130,"authors":[{"name":"G.

To realize high-sensitivity, high-speed sense circuits, a pMOS transistor (whose gate is connected to its drain) is used as a load transistor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62136/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","volume":"25","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3814250","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An 80-ns 1-Mb flash memory with on-chip erase/erase-verify controller","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An 80-ns 1-Mb flash memory with on-chip erase/erase-verify controller","sourcePdf":"00062136.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097153S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"8","articleId":"62136","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":62142,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The pipeline latency is only two cycles, and a double-precision result is produced every cycle. System throughput and accuracy are increased by using a floating-point multiply-add-fused unit, which carries out a double-precision accumulate as a two-cycle pipelined execution with only one rounding error. While the cycle time (40 ns) is competitive with other CMOS RISC systems, the floating-point performance stretches to the range of bipolar RISC systems (7.4-13 MFLOPS LINPACK). Leading zero anticipation makes the two-cycle pipeline possible by nearly eliminating the additional postnormalization time, and it allows for reduced overall system latency. Partial decode shifters allow complete time sharing for the multiply and data alignment.

The investigation is done experimentally by implementing a set of industrial circuits as FPGAs using CAD (computer-aided design) tools for technology mapping, placement, and routing. A range of programming technologies (the method of FPGA customization) is explored using a simple model of the interconnection and logic block area. The experiments are based on logic blocks that use lookup tables for implementing combinational logic. Results indicate that the best number of inputs to use (a measure of the block's functionality) is between three and four, and that a D flip-flop should be included in the logic block. The results are largely independent of the programming technology. More generally, it was observed that the area efficiency of a logic block depends not only on its functionality but also on the average number of pins connected per logic block.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic arrays","Field programmable gate arrays","Logic programming","Logic circuits","Design automation","Programmable logic arrays","Logic gates","Digital circuits","Computer industry","Industrial relations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","combinatorial circuits","logic arrays","logic CAD","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field-programmable gate arrays","logic block functionality","area efficiency","FPGA","logic block","digital circuits","CAD","computer-aided design","technology mapping","placement","routing","lookup tables","combinational logic","D flip-flop"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=62145","doi":"10.1109/4.62145","startPage":"1217","endPage":"1225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2262/00062145.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.62145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62145/","displayDocTitle":"Architecture of field-programmable gate arrays: the effect of logic block functionality on area efficiency","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","volume":"25","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3814258","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture of field-programmable gate arrays: the effect of logic block functionality on area efficiency","sourcePdf":"00062145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041108S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"147","articleId":"62145","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":62152,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

These VLSI circuits are fully programmable, thereby usable in many applications. The architecture is implemented by using two different approaches: analog implementation with switched-capacitor structures and fully digital implementation. The approaches are also compared from the VLSI point of view. The advantage of the switched-capacitor implementation is the small area of a synapse, thus relatively large networks can be implemented. The architecture of the network is also regular, modular, and easy to expand. For the same complexity of network architecture, the digital implementation requires 30% more silicon area, which can be considered quite insignificant. The advantage of the fully digital implementation is good expandability to larger networks.

The basic current-mode circuits, including the SI differential integrator/summer are developed. The SI integrator/summer is shown to be directly analogous to the switched-capacitor (SC) integrator/summer; thus, all the synthesis techniques developed for the design of SC filters can be used to synthesize SI filters. Signal flowgraph synthesis of SI ladder filters is presented. The nonideal characteristics of SI ladder filters that limit their accuracy are evaluated. Clock-feedthrough and device mismatch induced errors are more severe in the present SI circuit configurations than in SC circuits. A standard digital 2- mu m n-well CMOS process has been used to implement two high-order ladder filters. Simulations accurately predict the measured results of the first integrated SI filters.

The tuning scheme necessary to maintain the stable and accurate frequency response in the presence of temperature variations, process tolerance, and aging is described. Detailed design techniques specific to high-frequency operation are introduced to implement a 5-V, seventh-order elliptic analog magnitude filter for antialiasing in digital video applications. The filter, based on a G/sub m/-C technique, exhibits a dynamic range of 61 dB and dissipates a power of 75 mW. Ninety-two chips from various wafers and two different process runs were tested. Seventy-five percent of the fabricated chips were functional, and 63% of them met the commercial-grade specifications in spite of an error in the layout which forced the phase control circuitry to perform suboptimally.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.62164","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2263/00062164.pdf","startPage":"1368","endPage":"1378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.62164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design considerations for high-frequency continuous-time filters and implementation of an antialiasing filter for digital video","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=62164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62164/","displayDocTitle":"Design considerations for high-frequency continuous-time filters and implementation of an antialiasing filter for digital video","volume":"25","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3847515","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design considerations for high-frequency continuous-time filters and implementation of an antialiasing filter for digital video","sourcePdf":"00062164.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049533S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"147","articleId":"62164","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":62165,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This technique is based on the concept that a very high DC gain can be achieved in combination with any unity-gain frequency achievable by a (folded-) cascode design. Bode-plot measurements for an op amp realized in a 1.6- mu m process show a DC gain of 90 dB and a unity-gain frequency of 116 MHz (16-pF load). Settling measurements with a feedback factor of 1/3 show a fast single-pole settling behavior corresponding to a closed-loop bandwidth of 18 MHz (35-pF load) and a settling accuracy better than 0.03%. This technique does not cause any loss in output voltage swing. At a supply voltage of 5.0 V an output swing of about 4.2 V is achieved without loss in DC gain. The above advantages are achieved with a 30% increase in chip area and a 15% increase in power consumption.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.62165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.62165","startPage":"1379","endPage":"1384","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2263/00062165.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast-settling CMOS op amp for SC circuits with 90-dB DC gain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"A fast-settling CMOS op amp for SC circuits with 90-dB DC gain","volume":"25","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3847516","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast-settling CMOS op amp for SC circuits with 90-dB DC gain","sourcePdf":"00062165.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054092S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"506","articleId":"62165","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":62168,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The residual error of the ADC due to capacitor voltage dependence is minimized using a quadratic voltage coefficient (QVC) self-calibration scheme. A dual-comparator topology with digital error correction circuitry is used to avoid errors due to comparator threshold hysteresis.

In a prototype digitally corrected converter, one capacitor-array multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC) is used repeatedly as a sample-and-hold (S/H) amplifier, a DAC, and a residue amplifier so that the proposed converter may obtain linearity with the capacitor-array matching. An experimental fully differential A/D converter implemented using a double-poly 1- mu m CMOS technology consumes 250 mW with a 5-V single supply, and its active die area, including all digital logic and output buffers, is 1.75 mm/sup 2/ (2700 mil/sup 2/). Because the conversion accuracy of the proposed architecture relies on a capacitor-array MDAC linearity, high-resolution CMOS A/D conversions are feasible at high frequencies if sophisticated circuit techniques are further developed. For high-speed two-phase versions, the system can be easily modified to use multiplexing and/or pipelining techniques with a separate S/H amplifier and/or two separate flash converters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 10-b 15-MHz CMOS recycling two-step A/D converter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.62176","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2263/00062176.pdf","startPage":"1328","endPage":"1338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.62176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2263","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=62176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62176/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"A 10-b 15-MHz CMOS recycling two-step A/D converter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3847510","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 10-b 15-MHz CMOS recycling two-step A/D converter","sourcePdf":"00062176.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039998S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"114","articleId":"62176","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":62177,"authors":[{"name":"R.

An important aspect of the method is the decoupled manner in which the polynomials A(z) and B(z) are determined.

The authors study the design of control when every criterion of interest takes the form of an H/sub 2/ norm defined over certain exogenous inputs and controlled outputs of the system. The objective is to find all stabilizing controllers that are noninferior with respect to the defined objectives, that is, to find the set of Pareto-optimal controllers. The novel feature is the use of the Youla parametrization to represent the admissible controllers. This representation enables the authors to show that each criterion, and hence their weighted sum, is convex over the class of admissible controllers. Since the set of admissible controllers is itself convex, the Pareto-optimal controllers can be determined by the standard scalarization technique. It is concluded that, in general, the controller order is higher than the order of the plant.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62264/","volume":"36","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3857664","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","displayDocTitle":"Multiple objective optimal control of linear systems: the quadratic norm case","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple objective optimal control of linear systems: the quadratic norm case","sourcePdf":"00062264.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034708S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"84","articleId":"62264","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":62265,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.H.

In the problem, the objective is not the usual one of forcing the error between the plant output and the reference model output asymptotically to zero, but instead, it is that of forcing this error to be less than a (arbitrarily small) prespecified constant after a (arbitrarily short) prespecified period of time, with a (arbitrarily small) prespecified upper bound on the amount of overshoot. It is shown that to achieve this goal for a stabilizable and detectable, single-input single-output linear time-invariant (LTI) plant, it is necessary and sufficient that the plant be minimum phase. Knowledge of an upper bound on the plant order, of the relative degree, and of the sign of the high-frequency gain is not required. The controller proposed consists of an LTI compensator together with a switching mechanism to adjust the compensator parameters. If an upper bound on the relative degree is available, the compensator has dynamics of order equal to this upper bound less one; otherwise, the order of the compensator is adjusted as well as its parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.62269","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/2266/00062269.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.62269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive controller which provides an arbitrarily good transient and steady-state response","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=62269","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62269/","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive controller which provides an arbitrarily good transient and steady-state response","volume":"36","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3857669","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive controller which provides an arbitrarily good transient and steady-state response","sourcePdf":"00062269.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092282S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"205","articleId":"62269","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":62270,"authors":[{"name":"R.F.

MOSFETs with BF/sub 2/ or boron-implanted polysilicon gates were processed identically except at gate implantation. Evidence of boron penetration through 12.5-nm oxide and a large quantity of negative charge penetration (10/sup 12/ cm/sup -2/) by fluorine even at moderate annealing conditions is reported. The degree of degradation is aggravated as fluorine dose increases. A detailed examination of the I-V characteristics of PMOSFET with fluorine incorporated p/sup +/-gate revealed that the long gate-length device had abnormal abrupt turn-on I/sub d/-V/sub g/ characteristics, while the submicrometer-gate-length devices appeared to be normal. The abnormal turn-on I/sub d/-V/sub g/ characteristics associated with long-gate-length p/sup +/-gate devices vanished when the device was subjected to X-ray irradiation and/or to a high-voltage DC stressing at the source/drain. The C-V characteristics of MOS structures of various gate dopants, processing ambients, doping concentrations, and annealing conditions were studied. Based on all experimental results, the degradation model of p/sup +/-gate devices is presented. The incorporation of fluorine in the p/sup +/ gate enhances boron penetration through the thin gate oxide into the silicon substrate and creates negative-charge interface states. The addition of H/OH species into F-rich gate oxide will further aggravate the extent of F-enhanced boron penetration by annealing out the negative-charge interface states.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.62294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/2267/00062294.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.62294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2267","startPage":"2312","endPage":"2321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comprehensive study on p/sup +/ polysilicon-gate MOSFET's instability with fluorine incorporation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=62294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A comprehensive study on p/sup +/ polysilicon-gate MOSFET's instability with fluorine incorporation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62294/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3825279","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comprehensive study on p/sup +/ polysilicon-gate MOSFET's instability with fluorine incorporation","sourcePdf":"00062294.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037119S","chronDate":"Nov.  1990","isNumber":"2267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"55","articleId":"62294","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":62299,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The structure used makes possible a Josephson device with an output voltage equal to a multiple of the gap voltage. As a result one of the structures becomes almost the same as a direct-coupled-logic gate. However, multiple junctions are required and circuit parameters in the gate must be optimized for synchronized switching. In experiments, the synchronized switching of all junctions connected in series and parallel were demonstrated. A high-voltage gate was constructed using synchronized switching and was applied to a cell driver in a Josephson memory circuit. The output voltage was four times the gap voltage, and a fast access of 590 ps was obtained.

Using the project implementation profile, a set of managerially controllable factors is identified as associated with project failure. The factors differed according to three contingency variables: the precise way in which failure was defined; the type of project, and the stage of the project in its life cycle. Implications for project management and for future research on failed projects are discussed. The results demonstrated empirical justification for a multidimensional construct of project failure, encompassing both internal efficiency and external effectiveness aspects. The fact that the critical factors associated with failure depended on the way in which failure is defined suggests that it is necessary to know considerably more about how project managers define failure (and success) and, indeed how the parent organization makes judgments on the matter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62322/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3825299","volume":"37","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The causes of project failure","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The causes of project failure","sourcePdf":"00062322.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04663S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"17","citationCount":"284","articleId":"62322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":62345,"authors":[{"name":"D.K.

A static magnetic field in the direction of propagation is assumed to be present, resulting in longitudinal propagation. The incident wave splits into three waves whose frequencies are different from that of the incident wave. It is shown that these waves ultimately damp out if the plasma is even slightly lossy. The damping of the waves is interpreted in terms of their attenuation with distance and decay with time as they propagate in the lossy plasma. The attenuation-length and decay-time constants of the waves are obtained, and their dependence on the incident-wave frequency and the gyrofrequency is examined.

In this concept, a relativistic electron beam is injected into a plasma whose density is comparable to or lower than the beam's density. The head of the electron beam pushes out the plasma electrons, leaving an ion channel. The ion-focusing force causes the electrons to oscillate (betatron oscillations) about the axis and plays a role similar to the magnetic field in a cyclotron autoresonance maser (CARM). Radiation can be produced with wave frequencies from microwaves to X-rays depending on the beam energy and plasma density: omega approximately 2 gamma /sup 3/2/ omega /sub pe/, where gamma is the Lorentz factor of the beam and omega /sub pe/ is the plasma frequency. Transverse (relativistic) bunching and axial (conventional) bunching are the amplification mechanisms in ICLs; only the latter effect operates in free-electron lasers. The competition of these two bunching mechanisms depends on beam velocity nu /sub 0z/; their dependences on nu /sub 0z/ cancel for the cyclotron autoresonance masers. A linear theory is developed to study the physical mechanisms, and a PIC (particle-in-cell) simulation code is used to verify the theory. The mechanism is examined as a possible explanation for experimentally observed millimeter radiation from relativistic electron beams interacting with plasmas.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/27.62351","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00062351.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/27/2269/00062351.pdf","startPage":"837","endPage":"841","doi":"10.1109/27.62351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the amplification mechanism of the ion-channel laser","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"On the amplification mechanism of the ion-channel laser","volume":"18","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3825894","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62351/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the amplification mechanism of the ion-channel laser","sourcePdf":"00062351.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035961S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"33","articleId":"62351","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":62370,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It is a combined system of a shunt passive filter and a small rated series active filter. The compensation principle is described, and some filtering characteristics are discussed in detail. Excellent practicability and validity to compensate for harmonics in power systems are demonstrated experimentally. Although the source harmonic voltage was only 1%, the source harmonic current reached about 10% before the series active filter was started. After it was started, no harmonic current flowed into the shunt passive filter. In addition, no harmonic voltage appeared at the terminals of the shunt passive filter, because the source harmonic voltage was applied to the series active filter. The total loss of the series active filter was less than 40 W. It is concluded that the combined system is far superior in efficiency to conventional shunt active filters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.62380","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/2271/00062380.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.62380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2271","startPage":"983","endPage":"990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to harmonic compensation in power systems-a combined system of shunt passive and series active filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=62380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to harmonic compensation in power systems-a combined system of shunt passive and series active filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62380/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3868703","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to harmonic compensation in power systems-a combined system of shunt passive and series active filters","sourcePdf":"00062380.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047954S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1990","isNumber":"2271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"486","articleId":"62380","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":62384,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

Online data acquisition and analysis of the harmonic content of system voltages and currents may be necessary to identify the cause properly and recommend a solution. In response to these problems, a field-proven portable harmonic-measurement/analysis system is described, as well as the advantages and versatility inherent in its use. This portable, computer-based system provides on-site data collection, precise harmonic identification via a fast Fourier transform, data analysis, and report preparation via a custom spreadsheet.

It is shown that the orientation takes place under a field strength of 10/sup 6/ V/m and the frequency at around 1 MHz. The stretch and shrink of an individual molecule is observed as the field is switched on and off. The molecular size (i.e. number of base pairs) is obtainable by measuring the stretched length of the molecule. A special field configuration is designed for the efficient molecular size determination using this principle. Molecular manipulation techniques, the alignment and positioning of the individual molecule, and the cutting of DNA at arbitrary locations with an ultraviolet beam are developed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/2271/00062403.pdf","startPage":"1165","endPage":"1172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.62403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.62403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=62403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrostatic manipulation of DNA in microfabricated structures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrostatics","DNA","Dielectrophoresis","Electrodes","Fluorescence","Visualization","Frequency","Length measurement","Size measurement","Molecular beams"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","DNA","electrophoresis","electrostatics","molecular biophysics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["molecule positioning","microfabricated structures","electrostatic orientation","dielectrophoresis","DNA","high-intensity field","microfabricated electrode system","fluorescent method","visualization technique","cutting","ultraviolet beam","1 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Electrostatic manipulation of DNA in microfabricated structures","volume":"26","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3857852","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrostatic manipulation of DNA in microfabricated structures","sourcePdf":"00062403.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048005S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1990","isNumber":"2271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"266","articleId":"62403","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":62410,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

Next, making use of these results, they develop a synthesis procedure for the class of neural networks considered. In the analysis section, techniques from the theory of large-scale interconnected dynamical systems are used to derive tests for the asymptotic stability of an equilibrium of the neural network. Estimates for the rate at which the trajectories of the network will converge from an initial condition to a final state are presented. In the synthesis section the stability tests from the analysis section are used as constraints to develop a design algorithm for associative memories. The algorithm presented guarantees that each desired memory will be stored as an equilibrium, and that each desired memory will be asymptotically stable.

Both stationary and nonstationary environments are considered. Three main contributions are presented. The first, corresponding to the stationary case, is a proof of the convergence of the algorithm in the case of a M-dependent sequence of correlated observation vectors. It is proven that the steady state mean square misalignment of the adaptive filter weights has an upper bound proportional to the algorithm step size mu . The second contribution, also belonging to the stationary case, is the derivation of the expressions of convergence time N/sub c/ and steady state mean square excess estimation error epsilon . It is shown that N/sub c/ is proportional to 1/( mu lambda ), with lambda being the minimum eigenvalue of the input covariance matrix. It is also shown that the product N/sub c/ epsilon is independent of mu . For a given epsilon , the convergence time increases with the eigenvalue spread of the input covariance matrix and the filter length, as well as its input noise power. The range of mu that achieves tolerable values of N/sub c/ and epsilon is determined. The third contribution is concerned with the nonstationary case. It is shown that the mean square excess estimation error is the sum of the two terms with opposite dependencies on mu . An optimum value of mu is derived.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and design of a signed regressor LMS algorithm for stationary and nonstationary adaptive filtering with correlated Gaussian data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/31.62411","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/2272/00062411.pdf","startPage":"1367","endPage":"1374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.62411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=62411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62411/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of a signed regressor LMS algorithm for stationary and nonstationary adaptive filtering with correlated Gaussian data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3837558","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of a signed regressor LMS algorithm for stationary and nonstationary adaptive filtering with correlated Gaussian data","sourcePdf":"00062411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037382S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"84","articleId":"62411","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":62412,"authors":[{"name":"W.M.C.

Design criteria and techniques of CMOS readout front ends are presented so as to fully exploit the maximal capability of a CMOS technology. The optimal input transistor dimensions and bias conditions of charge sensitive amplifiers (CSA) are analytically determined. For readout front ends using semi-Gaussian pulse shapers, the optimal number of integrators and the optimal peaking time are determined from the point of view of achieving the best detector resolution. In order to verify the theoretical analyses, a charge sensitive amplifier and a fourth-order semi-Gaussian pulse shaper with 1- mu s peaking time have been designed in a standard 3- mu m CMOS technology.

Examples of RLCG lines driven by bipolar logic gates are given to illustrate the advantage of waveform relaxation over the discrete time simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.62414","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/2272/00062414.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.62414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2272","startPage":"1394","endPage":"1415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveform relaxation analysis of RLCG transmission lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=62414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Waveform relaxation analysis of RLCG transmission lines","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62414/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3825936","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveform relaxation analysis of RLCG transmission lines","sourcePdf":"00062414.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030989S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"94","articleId":"62414","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":62415,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

The notion of the earliest starting time of a task is formulated for the context of lower bounds. A lower bound on the completion time is proposed. A task delay which does not increase the earliest completion time of a schedule is defined. Each task can then be scheduled within a time interval without affecting the lower bound performance on the finish time. This leads to definition of a new lower bound on the number of processors required to process the task graph. A derivation of the minimum time increase over the earliest completion time is also proposed for the case of a smaller number of processors. A lower bound on the minimum number of interprocessor communication links required to achieve optimum performance is proposed. Evaluation had been carried out by using a set of 360 small graphs. The bound on the finish time deviates at most by 5% from the optimum solution in 96% of the cases and performs well with respect to the minimum number of processors and communication links.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.62447","startPage":"1390","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/2273/00062447.pdf","endPage":"1401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.62447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62447/","displayDocTitle":"Lower bound on the number of processors and time for scheduling precedence graphs with communication costs","volume":"16","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3857946","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lower bound on the number of processors and time for scheduling precedence graphs with communication costs","sourcePdf":"00062447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018174S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"75","articleId":"62447","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":62523,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

The deformation behavior was characterized as a function of strain, strain rate, joint thickness, and hold time. Implications of the results are discussed relative to thermal stresses and solder joint reliability in an electronic package. Work hardening during loading was found to increase with strain rate and volume fraction of intermetallics. The behavior was also dependent on the amount of work hardening and recovery that occurred in the prior stress relaxation cycle. The stress-strain rate characteristics during relaxation were found to be a function of the initial strain level and the spring constant of the assembly. It is shown how a material constitutive relation can be used with the assembly spring constant to calculate stress reduction over time. This procedure can be applied to any electronic assembly which undergoes stress relaxation during a constant temperature hold.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62558/","volume":"13","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"3848386","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Shear deformation of indium solder joints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shear deformation of indium solder joints","sourcePdf":"00062558.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05897S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"14","articleId":"62558","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":62564,"authors":[{"name":"G.C.

The model was used to investigate the effect of several important factors on the development of thermal stresses in MLCCs. These factors relate to the solder process temperature profile and to the MLCC printed wiring board geometry and material properties. The results indicate that the peak temperature during wave solder and the geometry and material properties of the MLCC termination have a major influence on the development of thermal stresses in MLCCs. These factors are actually a small portion of the factors commonly thought to have a significant influence on thermal stress development.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/33.62564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/33/2278/00062564.pdf","startPage":"1135","endPage":"1145","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00062564.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/33.62564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal stresses in multilayer ceramic capacitors: numerical simulations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62564/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Thermal stresses in multilayer ceramic capacitors: numerical simulations","volume":"13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3848415","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal stresses in multilayer ceramic capacitors: numerical simulations","sourcePdf":"00062564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07377S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"9","articleId":"62564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":62568,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The influence of thermal fatigue on microbonding is discussed. After a temperature cycling test, the striations traced by thermal fatigue were observed on the fractured surface. Their intervals were as fine as 0.04-0.2 mu m.

A discriminant hidden Markov model (HMM) is defined, and it is shown how a particular MLP with contextual and extra feedback input units can be considered as a general form of such a Markov model. A link between these discriminant HMMs, trained along the Viterbi algorithm, and any other approach based on least mean square minimization of an error function (LMSE) is established. It is shown theoretically and experimentally that the outputs of the MLP (when trained along the LMSE or the entropy criterion) approximate the probability distribution over output classes conditioned on the input, i.e. the maximum a posteriori probabilities. Results of a series of speech recognition experiments are reported. The possibility of embedding MLP into HMM is described.

Resolution reduction is used for accelerating shape-from-shading algorithms using multiresolution pyramids. The goal of this correspondence is to show that resolution reduction based only on image intensities can be inferior to resolution reduction using knowledge of the surface reflectance. This is true for all cases of parameter estimation from intensity images, when the intensity is not a linear function of the parameters. Since optical reduction of images, as when moving a camera away from the object, is a simple gray-level averaging a question is cast on the general scheme of shape-from-shading.

Many adaptive filters have been developed for speckle reduction, the most well known of which are analyzed. It is shown that they are based on a test related to the local coefficient of variation of the observed image, which describes the scene heterogeneity. Some practical criteria are introduced to modify the filters in order to make them more efficient. The filters are tested on a simulated synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image and an SAR-580 image. As was expected, the new filters perform better, i.e. they average the homogeneous areas better and preserve texture information, edges, linear features, and point target responses better at the same time.

Polarization effects can be important in certain scenes, and the difference in rendering even simple scenes with and without proper treatment of polarization can be striking. All light waves possess a state of polarization, which changes almost every time light reflects off a material surface. A single reflection partially polarizes and may even completely polarize previously unpolarized light. Polarization influences the rendering of a scene because the reflected radiant intensity depends largely on the incident light waves's polarization state. E. Wolf's (1959) coherence matrix formalism of polarization has been incorporated into the Torrance-Sparrow reflectance model. This combination allows elegant quantitative derivations of the altered polarization state of light upon reflection in a ray tracer. Comparisons of identical scenes rendered with a conventional ray tracer and the ray tracer presented incorporating a polarization model show that the present method renders specular interobject reflections more accurately with respect to reflected radiance and color.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/38.62695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/38/2285/00062695.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"55","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00062695.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/38.62695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray tracing with polarization parameters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=62695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62695/","displayDocTitle":"Ray tracing with polarization parameters","volume":"10","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3855240","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray tracing with polarization parameters","sourcePdf":"00062695.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041887S","chronDate":"Nov.  1990","isNumber":"2285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"28","articleId":"62695","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":62698,"authors":[{"name":"F.

This approach is based on the modeling of both the logic and timing behavior of a circuit. Using the logic propagation conditions associated with each delay, efficient algorithms have been developed to find statically sensitizable paths. These algorithms simultaneously perform a longest path search and a partial verification of the sensitization of the paths. The resulting paths undergo a final and complete sensitization. The algorithms find the longest statically sensitizable path, whose length is a lower bound to the critical path length, and its associated sensitizing input vector. The algorithms can be easily modified to provide an ordered list of all the statically sensitizable paths above a given threshold. An initial analysis of the circuit by the PERT algorithm guides the critical path search and allows pruning of subgraphs that cannot lead to the solution. Results show that these techniques succeed in curbing the combinatorial explosion associated with the longest statically sensitizable path search.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing verification using statically sensitizable paths","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.62737","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/2287/00062737.pdf","startPage":"10723","endPage":"10784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.62737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2287","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=62737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62737/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"Timing verification using statically sensitizable paths","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3822773","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing verification using statically sensitizable paths","sourcePdf":"00062737.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0336S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"53","articleId":"62737","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":62772,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

A novel global router is proposed; each step consists of finding a tree, called a Steiner min-max tree, that is Steiner tree with maximum-weight edge minimized (real vertices represent channels containing terminals of a net, Steiner vertices represent intermediate channels, and weights correspond to densities). An O (min(e loglog e, n/sup 2/)) time algorithm is proposed for obtaining a Steiner min-max tree in a weighted graph with e edges and n vertices. (This result should be contrasted with the NP-completeness of the traditional minimum-length Steiner tree problem).

The authors show how a collection of neural units can be used efficiently for VQ encoding, with the units performing the bulk of the computation in parallel, and describe two unsupervised neural network learning algorithms for training the vector quantizer. A powerful feature of the new training algorithms is that the VQ codewords are determined in an adaptive manner, compared to the popular LBG training algorithm, which requires that all the training data be processed in a batch mode. The neural network approach allows for the possibility of training the vector quantizer online, thus adapting to the changing statistics of the input data.

This model differs from most of the currently seen neural networks in that it allows a network to adapt its structure by adding neurons, killing neurons, and modifying the structural relationships between neurons in the network. An adaptive vector quantization source-coding system based on SPAN is proposed. The major advantage of using SPAN as the codebook of a vector quantizer is that SPAN can capture the local context of the source signal space and map onto a lattice structure. A fast codebook-searching method utilizing the local context of the lattice is proposed, and a coding scheme, called the path coding method, for eliminating the correlation buried in the source sequence is introduced. The performance of the proposed coder is compared to an LBG (Y. Linde, A. Buzo, and R.M. Gray, 1980) coder on synthesized Gauss-Markov sources. Simulation results show that, without using the path coding method, SPAN yields performance similar to an LBG coder; however, if the path coding method is used, SPAN displays a much better performance than the LBG for highly correlated signal sources.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.62824","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"1458","endPage":"1471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/2292/00062824.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.62824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive vector quantization using a self-development neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vector quantization","Neural networks","Neurons","Lattices","Decoding","Adaptive systems","Source coding","Statistics","Signal synthesis","Gaussian processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","encoding","neural nets","picture processing","speech analysis and processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech processing","image processing","self-development neural network","space partition network","adaptive vector quantization source-coding system","fast codebook-searching method","path coding method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive vector quantization using a self-development neural network","volume":"8","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3836314","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62824/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive vector quantization using a self-development neural network","sourcePdf":"00062824.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045401S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"47","articleId":"62824","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":62825,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

The technique uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the BER and mean field annealing (MFA) to optimize the pulse shapes. Modeling of the link can be as complex as simulation will allow, while MFA is resistant to the statistical variation in the BER estimate from the simulation. Initially, the MFA technique was applied to a binary symmetric channel in a nonsimulation environment, and an approximate analysis of the behavior of MFA for this problem was performed. In a more complex example, MFA was coupled with Monte Carlo simulation techniques to find near-optimal transmit and receive filters for a satellite communications link, taking 6 CPU hours on a DECstation 3100. The BER of the link was found to be as much as three orders of magnitude lower when using the MFA-constructed optimal filters than when using filters from other comparison results. For this example, the pulse shapes obtained using MFA exhibit a low BER even as the parameter controlling the nonlinearity of the satellite-link model is varied over a wide range, thus showing the solution is robust.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62825/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","volume":"8","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"3824050","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of transmitter and receiver filters for digital communication systems using mean field annealing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of transmitter and receiver filters for digital communication systems using mean field annealing","sourcePdf":"00062825.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054771S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"8","articleId":"62825","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":62826,"authors":[{"name":"C.-Y.

After partitioning the complete system into several stages, each selected algorithm can be implemented on a single ASIC based on an efficient architectural style. The required throughput for high-performance data compression and channel coding has been obtained due to the optimization of the critical path in the architectural design. Input/output (I/O) operations, which create the bottleneck for many image-processing algorithms, are handled by a dedicated I/O interface unit. Construction of each dedicated data path in the architecture is based on a limited parameterizable functional building block (FBB) library. The dedicated data paths have been constructed by partitioning the initial signal flow graph (SFG) into compatible graphs and by matching the graphs in each partition onto a collection of time-multiplexed FBBs. Hierarchically partitioned controllers were used to meet the high-throughput requirements. The ASIC architectures proposed are oriented to broadband integrated services digital networks (B-ISDN) as well as high-performance digital image compression systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient VLSI architectures for a high-performance digital image communication system","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.62826","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/2292/00062826.pdf","startPage":"1481","endPage":"1491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.62826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2292","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=62826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62826/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"Efficient VLSI architectures for a high-performance digital image communication system","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3836315","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient VLSI architectures for a high-performance digital image communication system","sourcePdf":"00062826.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052747S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"1","articleId":"62826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":62828,"authors":[{"name":"G.J.

A pair of CMOS chips has been designed and submitted for fabrication in a 1.25- mu m process and is expected to accommodate symbol rates up to 35 MBd. The modulator chip accepts a pair of 8-b in-phase and quadrature data streams and generates a bandlimited IF output with an excess bandwidth factor of 35%. The demodulator chip accepts a digitized IF input signal and generates a pair of filtered in-phase and quadrature baseband signals. The modulator and demodulator chips each incorporate 40-tap multiplierless FIR (finite-impulse response) square-root Nyquist matched filters, and the cascade of the two chips achieves a peak intersymbol interference distortion of -54 dB. The modulator chip can generate any arbitrary signal constellation within a rectangular grid of 256*256 points. Thus, the all-digital implementation results in a generic chip set suitable for a wide variety of high bit-rate digital modem designs using formats such as M-ary PSK and QAM.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/2292/00062829.pdf","startPage":"1512","endPage":"1519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A VLSI architecture for a high-speed all-digital quadrature modulator and demodulator for digital radio applications","doi":"10.1109/49.62829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.62829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=62829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62829/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI architecture for a high-speed all-digital quadrature modulator and demodulator for digital radio applications","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3824053","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI architecture for a high-speed all-digital quadrature modulator and demodulator for digital radio applications","sourcePdf":"00062829.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043877S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"42","articleId":"62829","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":62830,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Because the two operations of the loop form an algebraic structure called semiring, it is shown that the ACS recursion of the Viterbi algorithm can therefore be written as a linear vector recursion. This allows the authors to employ the powerful techniques of parallel processing and pipelining, known for conventional linear systems, to achieve high throughput rates. Since the VA can be written as a linear vector recursion, it can be implemented by systolic arrays. For the class of shuffle exchange codes to be decoded by the Viterbi algorithm hardware-efficient code-optimized arrays are presented. It is shown that carry-save arithmetic can be used for the operations of ACS recursion, allowing each word-level operation to be pipelined and carried out by an efficient bit-level systolic array.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.62830","startPage":"1520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/2292/00062830.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.62830","endPage":"1534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-rate Viterbi processor: a systolic array solution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62830/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"High-rate Viterbi processor: a systolic array solution","volume":"8","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3836316","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-rate Viterbi processor: a systolic array solution","sourcePdf":"00062830.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051233S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"67","articleId":"62830","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":62831,"authors":[{"name":"Y.R.

The algorithm is restructured, and a method is given to decode any RS code generated by any generator polynomial. The main advantage of the decoder structure is its versatility, that is, it can be programmed to decode any Reed-Solomon code defined in Galois field (GF) 2/sup m/ with a fixed symbol size m. This decoder can correct errors and erasures for any RS code, including shortened and singly extended codes. It is shown that the decoder has a very simple structure and can be used to design high-speed single-chip VLSI decoders. As an example, a gate-array-based programmable RS decoder is implemented on a single chip. This decoder chip can decode any RS code defined in GF (2/sup 5/) with any code word length and any number of information symbols.

The approach uses a class of spatial light modulator known as a deformable mirror device and leads to a steerable arbitrary antenna radiation pattern of the true time-delay type.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.62877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2294","startPage":"1824","endPage":"1828","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/2294/00062877.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A photonic variable RF delay line for phased array antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A photonic variable RF delay line for phased array antennas","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3867508","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A photonic variable RF delay line for phased array antennas","sourcePdf":"00062877.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034688S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"49","articleId":"62877","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":62884,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The basis signals are dependent on a set of real parameters selected to ensure that the signal model best approximates the data in a least-square-error (LSE) sense. In the nonlinear programming algorithms presented for computing the optimum parameter selection, the emphasis is placed on computational efficiency considerations. The development is formulated in a vector-space setting and uses such fundamental vector-space concepts as inner products, the range- and null-space matrices, orthogonal vectors, and the generalized Gramm-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure. A running set of representative signal-processing examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical concepts as well as point out the utility of LSE modeling. These examples include the modeling of empirical data as a sum of complex exponentials and sinusoids, linear prediction, linear recursive identification, and direction finding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00062941.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2297","publicationTitle":"IEEE ASSP Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE ASSP Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/53/2297/00062941.pdf","doi":"10.1109/53.62941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/53.62941","startPage":"12","endPage":"31","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal processing via least squares error modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/62941/","displayDocTitle":"Signal processing via least squares error modeling","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"3824755","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal processing via least squares error modeling","sourcePdf":"00062941.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037648S","chronDate":"Oct.  1990","isNumber":"2297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"53","citationCount":"70","articleId":"62941","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":62965,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The conceptual usefulness of the methods is demonstrated in a tutorial fashion by examples showing how formal statements of propagation, transduction, and boundary-value problems in complicated acoustic layered geometries such as those which occur in surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, in multicomponent laminates, and in bulk-wave composite transducers are simplified. The formulation given reduces the electroacoustic equations to a set of first-order matrix differential equations, one for each layer, in the variables that must be continuous across interfaces. The solution to these equations is a transfer matrix that maps the variables from one layer face to the other. Interface boundary conditions for a planar multilayer are automatically satisfied by multiplying the individual transfer matrices in the appropriate order, thus reducing the problem to just having to impose boundary conditions appropriate to the remaining two surfaces. The computational advantages of the matrix method result from the fact that the problem rank is independent of the number of layers, and from the availability of personal computer software that makes interactive numerical experimentation with complex layered structures practical.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.63103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/2305/00063103.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.63103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2305","startPage":"485","endPage":"490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matrix methods applied to acoustic waves in multilayers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=63103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Matrix methods applied to acoustic waves in multilayers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/63103/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3827485","pubMedId":"18285068","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matrix methods applied to acoustic waves in multilayers","sourcePdf":"00063103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056623S","chronDate":"Nov.  1990","isNumber":"2305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"219","articleId":"63103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":63104,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

The method uses a solid-state electric array reconfiguration controller (EARC), which senses the radiation as low, medium, or high. The controller chooses one favorable set of I-V characteristics for starting and another favorable set of I-V characteristics for steady-state operation. This is done by switching the solar panels, depending upon the starting current requirements and the irradiance level, from a parallel to series-parallel to series connection. This produces a sufficient starting current, especially at low and medium radiation levels, which considerably improves the pump's performance, particularly in the early morning, in the late evening, and on cloudy days, providing valuable extra pumping hours for the user.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.63135","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00063135.png","startPage":"653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/2306/00063135.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.63135","endPage":"658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of electrical array reconfiguration on the performance of a PV-powered volumetric water pump","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/63135/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"The effect of electrical array reconfiguration on the performance of a PV-powered volumetric water pump","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3827385","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of electrical array reconfiguration on the performance of a PV-powered volumetric water pump","sourcePdf":"00063135.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059787S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"95","articleId":"63135","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":63136,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

A generalized decision diagram was developed to ensure that all of the economic factors were considered and properly related for the customer side of the meter. Two economic models that had consistently given differing results were compared. One was the McKinney model developed at the University of Missouri at Rolla in 1987; the second was the SYSPLAN model developed by Battelle. Four specific cases were evaluated and compared. Differences were resolved on a point-by-point basis with reference to the current economic environment. The economic model was upgraded to include the best of both models based on the resolution of these differences. The upgrades were implemented as modifications to the original SYSPLAN (1986 version) to preserve user friendliness. The modified version is the result of an investigation into current standards and practices in engineering economics as well as power distribution engineering. Therefore, more accurate results are returned to the user. Comparisons have shown that this program generally returns values between the more conservative McKinney model and the more optimistic SYSPLAN model. However, the results do not follow a linear relationship between the two extremes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.63136","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/2306/00063136.pdf","startPage":"659","endPage":"665","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00063136.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.63136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Economic models for battery energy storage: improvements for existing methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=63136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/63136/","displayDocTitle":"Economic models for battery energy storage: improvements for existing methods","volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3827386","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Economic models for battery energy storage: improvements for existing methods","sourcePdf":"00063136.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022625S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"17","articleId":"63136","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":63138,"authors":[{"name":"Chengxiong Mao","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Chengxiong Mao","id":"37298186400"},{"name":"O.P.

The results imply a 30-to-50-fold increase in the ratio of linewidth to bit rate than can be used with the balanced loop, which has a structure much simpler than the decision-directed or Costas loops.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BPSK homodyne detection experiment using balanced optical phase-locked loop with quantized feedback","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/68.63240","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/2310/00063240.pdf","startPage":"840","endPage":"843","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00063240.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.63240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2310","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=63240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/63240/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1990","displayDocTitle":"BPSK homodyne detection experiment using balanced optical phase-locked loop with quantized feedback","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3850677","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BPSK homodyne detection experiment using balanced optical phase-locked loop with quantized feedback","sourcePdf":"00063240.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033215S","chronDate":"Nov.  1990","isNumber":"2310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"11","articleId":"63240","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":63257,"authors":[{"name":"N.

It is shown that prevention and avoidance of FMS deadlocks can be implemented using Petri net models. For deadlock prevention, the reachability graph of a Petri net model of the given FMS is used, whereas for deadlock avoidance, a Petri-net-based online controller is proposed. The modeling of the General Electric FMS at Erie, PA, is discussed. For such real-world systems, deadlock prevention using the reachability graph is not feasible. A generic, Petri-net-based online controller for implementing deadlock avoidance in such real-world FMSs is developed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.63257","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00063257.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2312/00063257.pdf","startPage":"713","endPage":"723","doi":"10.1109/70.63257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deadlock prevention and deadlock avoidance in flexible manufacturing systems using Petri net models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Deadlock prevention and deadlock avoidance in flexible manufacturing systems using Petri net models","volume":"6","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3860449","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/63257/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deadlock prevention and deadlock avoidance in flexible manufacturing systems using Petri net models","sourcePdf":"00063257.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042288S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"339","articleId":"63257","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":63273,"authors":[{"name":"Z.A.

The authors develop a Petri net (PN) model of concurrent job flow and dynamic resource allocation in an FMS and define deadlock in terms of transition enabling in the PN model. The problem of deadlock avoidance is addressed by introducing the notion of a restriction policy, which is a feedback policy for excluding some enabled transitions from the current resource allocation alternatives. The authors then present their deadlock avoidance algorithm (DAA) and prove that restricted deadlock can never occur for any resource allocation policy implemented under the DAA restriction policy. The DAA can be implemented easily in real time and is much less restrictive for FMS applications than existing algorithms for deadlock avoidance in computer systems. Application of the DAA is illustrated for three FMS examples: allocation of finite buffer space in a multicell machining facility, collision avoidance in a multirobot assembly cell, and coordination of multiple AGVs on a shop floor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00063273.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2312/00063273.pdf","startPage":"724","endPage":"734","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/70.63273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.63273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2312","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=63273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deadlock avoidance in flexible manufacturing systems with concurrently competing process flows","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System recovery","Flexible manufacturing systems","Resource management","Workstations","Application software","Manufacturing systems","Real time systems","Analytical models","Vehicle dynamics","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible manufacturing systems","Petri nets","production control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Petri net model","finite buffer space allocation","robots","multiple AGV coordination","flexible manufacturing systems","concurrently competing process flows","FMS","dynamic resource allocation","transition enabling","deadlock avoidance","feedback policy","multicell machining facility","collision avoidance","multirobot assembly cell"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/63273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Deadlock avoidance in flexible manufacturing systems with concurrently competing process flows","volume":"6","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3860450","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deadlock avoidance in flexible manufacturing systems with concurrently competing process flows","sourcePdf":"00063273.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051952S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"428","articleId":"63273","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":63298,"authors":[{"name":"R.B.

This budget crisis is defined for technologies associated with patterning, mechanical control, thermal treatments, particulates and contamination, defects, electrical parameters, and manufacturing, R&D priorities for silicon ULSI are identified and quantified, and the potential impact of some recent research results is discussed. It is pointed out that the R&D agenda to deal with the ULSI manufacturing budget crisis is enormous, and the semiconductor industry cannot perform all of it. Since the time for transferring new developments into production tools and technologies is five to seven years, it is concluded that critical funding decisions need to be made now for ULSI manufacturing science breakthroughs by the turn of the century.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/63298/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1990","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3829683","volume":"78","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Challenges to manufacturing submicron, ultra-large scale integrated circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Challenges to manufacturing submicron, ultra-large scale integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00063298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074635S","chronDate":"Nov.  1990","isNumber":"2314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"41","articleId":"63298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":63306,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.S.

If the first erroneous output is a noncodeword then the TSC goal is said to be achieved. The author has recently defined a new class of checkers which meet the TSC goal, namely, the strongly self-checking (SSC) checkers. A TSC or SSC checker can be guaranteed to meet the TSC goal if it receives the required set of codeword tests from the functional circuit. However, in practice, it is not always possible to ensure this for embedded checkers. A design for a sufficiently strongly self-checking (SSSC) embedded checker for systematic and separable codes is presented.

The problem of learning functions from a set X into a set Y is considered, assuming only that the examples are generated by independent draws according to an unknown probability measure on X*Y. The learner's goal is to find a function in a given hypothesis space of functions from X into Y that on average give Y values that are close to those observed in random examples. The discrepancy is measured by a bounded real-valued loss function. The average loss is called the error of the hypothesis. A theorem on the uniform convergence of empirical error estimates to true error rates is given for certain hypothesis spaces, and it is shown how this implies learnability. A generalized notion of VC dimension that applies to classes of real-valued functions and a notion of capacity for classes of functions that map into a bounded metric space are given. These measures are used to bound the rate of convergence of empirical error estimates to true error rates, giving bounds on the sample size needed for learning using hypotheses in these classes. As an application, a distribution-independent uniform convergence result for certain classes of functions computed by feedforward neural nets is obtained. Distribution-specific uniform convergence results for classes of functions that are uniformly continuous on average are also obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1989.63453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1989.63453","startPage":"40","endPage":"45","displayPublicationTitle":"30th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel2/260/2317/00063453.pdf","publicationTitle":"30th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2317","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00063453.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalizing the PAC model: sample size bounds from metric dimension-based uniform convergence results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Oct-1 Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"Generalizing the PAC model: sample size bounds from metric dimension-based uniform convergence results","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 1989","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3753887","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/63453/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalizing the PAC model: sample size bounds from metric dimension-based uniform convergence results","confLoc":"Research Triangle Park, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00063453.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066713S","chronDate":"30 Oct-1 Nov 1989","isNumber":"2317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"260","citationCount":"29","articleId":"63453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":63466,"authors":[{"name":"N.

It turns out that for many interesting concept classes there exist exponential differences between the number of counterexamples that are required by a 'naive' learning algorithm for C (e.g. one that always outputs the minimal consistent hypothesis) and a 'smart' learning algorithm for C, which attempts to make a more sophisticated prediction. theta (log n) bounds are given for the number of counterexamples that are required for learning boxes, balls, and halfspaces in a d-dimensional discrete space X=(1, . . ., n)/sup d/ (for every finite dimension d). Also given are an upper bound of O(d/sup 3/) and a lower bound of Omega (d/sup 2/) for the complexity of learning a threshold function with d input bits (i.e. X=(0, 1)/sup d/). For each of these concept classes one can give learning algorithms that are both optimal (or close to optimal in the case of threshold functions) with regard to the number of counterexamples which they require and computationally feasible. The complexity of learning the concept classes on several variations of the learning model considered is determined. The relationship between these learning models and some related combinatorial invariants is clarified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/63488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Oct-1 Nov 1989","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3753922","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the complexity of learning from counterexamples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the complexity of learning from counterexamples","confLoc":"Research Triangle Park, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00063488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026979S","chronDate":"30 Oct-1 Nov 1989","isNumber":"2317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"260","citationCount":"24","articleId":"63488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":63499,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

The performance data indicate that the CPU scheduling algorithm is the most significant of all the algorithms in improving the performance of real-time transactions, conflict-resolution protocols which directly address deadlines and criticality can have a substantial impact on performance compared to protocols that ignore such information, both criticality and deadline distributions strongly affect transaction performance, and overheads such as locking and message communication are nonnegligible and cannot be ignored in real-time transaction analysis.

In addition, a stochastic analysis which gives the probability distribution of the breakdown utilization of randomly generated task sets is presented. It is shown that as the task set size increases, the task computation times become of little importance, and the breakdown utilization converges to a constant determined by the task periods. For uniformly distributed tasks, a breakdown utilization of 88% is a reasonable characterization. A case is shown in which the average-case breakdown utilization reaches the worst-case lower bound of C.L. Liu and J.W.

An application-level program is written in Durra as a set of task descriptions that prescribes a way to manage the resources of a heterogeneous machine network. The application describes the tasks to be instantiated and executed as concurrent processes, the intermediate queues required to store the messages as they move from producer to consumer processes, and the possible dynamic reconfigurations of the application. The application-level programming paradigm fits a top-down, incremental method of software development very naturally. It is suggested that a language like Durra would be of great value in the development of large, distributed systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application software","Resource management","Libraries","Programming","Software quality","Software engineering","Computer science","Computer network management","Computer networks","US Government"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","high level languages","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Durra language","distributed applications","large-grained tasks","heterogeneous network","application-level program","heterogeneous machine network","intermediate queues","dynamic reconfigurations","software development"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=63761","doi":"10.1109/ICCL.1990.63761","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1990 International Conference on Computer Languages","pdfPath":"/iel2/282/2321/00063761.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCL.1990.63761","startPage":"59","endPage":"68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2321","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1990 International Conference on Computer Languages","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A language for distributed applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A language for distributed applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/63761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Mar 1990","conferenceDate":"12-15 March 1990","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3754082","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A language for distributed applications","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00063761.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046564S","chronDate":"12-15 Mar 1990","isNumber":"2321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"282","citationCount":"18","articleId":"63761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":63808,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The mechanism captures more features of such protocols than that given by M. Burrows et al. (1989) to which the proposals are a substantial extension. The notion of possession incorporated in the approach assumes that principles can include in messages data they do not believe in, but merely possess. This also enables conclusions such as 'Q possesses the shared key', as in an example to be derived. The approach places a strong emphasis on the separation between the content and the meaning of messages. This can increase consistency in the analysis and, more importantly, introduce the ability to reason at more than one level.

This approach uses sequential rules that characterize a user's behavior over time. A rulebase is used to store patterns of user activities, and anomalies are reported whenever a user's activity deviates significantly from those specified in the rules. The rules in the rulebase characterize either the sequential relationships between security audit records or the temporal properties of the records. The rules are created in two ways: they are either dynamically generated and modified by a time-based inductive engine in order to adapt to changes in a user's behavior, or they are specified by the security management to implement a site security policy. This approach allows the correlation between adjacent security events to be exploited for the purpose of greater sensitivity in anomaly detection against seemingly intractable (or erratic) activities using statistical approaches. Real-time detection of anomaly activities is possible.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/63857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 May 1990","publicationDate":"1990","conferenceDate":"7-9 May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3776826","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive real-time anomaly detection using inductively generated sequential patterns","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive real-time anomaly detection using inductively generated sequential patterns","confLoc":"Oakland, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00063857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04077S","chronDate":"7-9 May 1990","isNumber":"2323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"300","citationCount":"83","articleId":"63857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":63859,"authors":[{"name":"L.T.

The authors formalize various possible network attacks. Their basic strategy is to develop profiles of usage of network resources and then compare current usage patterns with the historical profile to determine possible security violations. Thus, the work is similar to the host-based intrusion-detection systems. Different from such systems, however, is the use of a hierarchical model to refine the focus of the intrusion-detection mechanism. The authors also report on the development of an experimental LAN monitor currently under implementation. Several network attacks have been simulated, and results on how the monitor has been able to detect these attacks are analyzed. Initial results demonstrate that many network attacks are detectable with the authors' monitor, although it can be defeated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Local area networks","Computerized monitoring","Computer security","Computer networks","Broadcasting","Ethernet networks","Wide area networks","Information security","Computer science","Area measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local area networks","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network security monitor","single broadcast LAN","local area network","Ethernet","network resources","host-based intrusion-detection systems","hierarchical model"]}],"previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00063859.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RISP.1990.63859","startPage":"296","endPage":"304","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy","pdfPath":"/iel2/300/2323/00063859.pdf","doi":"10.1109/RISP.1990.63859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A network security monitor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A network security monitor","accessionNumber":"3776828","publicationDate":"1990","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/63859/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A network security monitor","confLoc":"Oakland, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00063859.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047798S","chronDate":"7-9 May 1990","isNumber":"2323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"300","citationCount":"124","articleId":"63859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":63864,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Transactions are vital for MLS/DBMSs because they provide transparency to concurrency and failure. Concurrent execution of transactions may lead to contention among subjects for access to data, which in MLS/DBMSs may lead to security problems. Multiversion schedulers reduce the contention for access to data by maintaining multiple versions. A description is given of the relation between schedules produced in MLS/DBMSs and those which are multiversion serializable. The authors also propose a secure multiversion scheduler. They show that the scheduling protocol gives correct schedules and is free of covert channels due to contention for access to data, i.e. the scheduler is data-conflict-secure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/RISP.1990.63865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RISP.1990.63865","endPage":"383","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy","pdfPath":"/iel2/300/2323/00063865.pdf","startPage":"369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiversion concurrency control for multilevel secure database systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/63865/","displayDocTitle":"Multiversion concurrency control for multilevel secure database systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 May 1990","accessionNumber":"3776834","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiversion concurrency control for multilevel secure database systems","confLoc":"Oakland, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00063865.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035492S","chronDate":"7-9 May 1990","isNumber":"2323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"300","citationCount":"42","articleId":"63865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":63867,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It is very regular in structure and hence more easily reconfigurable than any existing sorting network with the same time complexity. Redundancy is provided at each level of the hierarchy. Hierarchical reconfiguration is implemented by replacing the faulty cells with spare cells at the lowest level first, and go to the next higher level to perform reconfiguration if there is not enough redundancy at the current level. In addition to defect tolerance after fabrication, these redundant cells can also be used for single error correction at run time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 Proceedings.

The following additional redundancy technologies are applied to them: word selection by automatic access error checking, pair unit replacement are for WDSH-based configurations using multiple RAM units, and two-level hierarchical redundancy is for ECHV-based ones. Performance estimation using a 1.5-micron 128 K-bit CMOS static RAM module model indicates that a remarkably higher degree of effective active area reduction, in respect to defect and fault occurrence, can be attained by an optimum WDSH-based configuration than by a general triplication-based redundancy configuration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICWSI.1990.63903","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00063903.png","publicationTitle":"1990 Proceedings.

An analytical model is developed to evaluate the average data under various voice and data traffic loads, and the results were verified by simulation. The data message delay for this ring network is smaller than that of the other integrated services ring protocols, and the voice packet loss probability in this network is essentially zero over a wide range of data and voice traffic loads. Urgent messages can be transmitted with a higher priority over voice, a feature that is not available in other integrated voice/data networks. Since the voice packet delay is bounded within one packetization period, no time-stamping is needed and the voice loss can be completely avoided by reserving a sufficient number of slots. Continual speech reception is possible by synchronizing the speech generation process to the end of each frame. Since the ring is synchronized, gateway switching to external circuit-switched and packet-switched networks would be very simple.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.63960","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00063960.png","publicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","startPage":"163","endPage":"169 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.63960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2325","pdfPath":"/iel2/808/2325/00063960.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intserv networks","Telecommunication traffic","Analytical models","Speech processing","Traffic control","Speech analysis","Protocols","Delay","Switching circuits","Packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ISDN","packet switching","probability","protocols","telecommunication traffic","token networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["slot reserving","priority message transmission","ISDN","integrated services token-controlled ring network","data traffic loads","data message delay","voice packet loss probability","voice traffic loads","voice packet delay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of an integrated services token-controlled ring network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/63960/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3719055","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of an integrated services token-controlled ring network","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00063960.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045433S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","isNumber":"2325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"808","citationCount":"4","articleId":"63960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":63995,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

The received power ratio between a packet signal with minimum received power and an interference signal is considered as a criterion for the capture effect. It is revealed that, though the maximum overall throughput for a slotted ALOHA over Rayleigh fading channels is very vulnerable to AWGN for a single common-receiver case, pluralizing common receivers dramatically improves the overall throughput. Surprisingly, it has also been found that, even if the signal-to-noise ratio is as bad as 2.5 (dB), the instability of a slotted ALOHA over Rayleigh-fading channels is still much less serious than that over channels without capture. This means that the capture effect overwhelms AWGN regarding stability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.64006","publicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","pdfPath":"/iel2/808/2325/00064006.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.64006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2325","startPage":"418","endPage":"422 vol.1","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00064006.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A slotted ALOHA with multiple common receivers over AWGN Rayleigh-fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=64006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A slotted ALOHA with multiple common receivers over AWGN Rayleigh-fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64006/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 1989","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3719100","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A slotted ALOHA with multiple common receivers over AWGN Rayleigh-fading channels","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00064006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065478S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","isNumber":"2325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"808","citationCount":"4","articleId":"64006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":64008,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

It is shown that the forms of the models were not changed by adding the ASE noise, except for two simple parameter modifications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.64051","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00064051.png","publicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","pdfPath":"/iel2/808/2325/00064051.pdf","startPage":"665","endPage":"670 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.64051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of nonlinearity in semiconductor optical amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of nonlinearity in semiconductor optical amplifiers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 1989","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3719133","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64051/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of nonlinearity in semiconductor optical amplifiers","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00064051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037986S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","isNumber":"2325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"808","citationCount":"4","articleId":"64051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":64052,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

As the bit-rate is not a constant, it is necessary to develop statistical models to measure the characteristics of the coded bit-rate sequence. Since model development and validation rely on the availability of appropriate experimental data, a complete system was set up for data collection. The bit rate profiles and the basic statistics of 30 independent video sources with various activity levels were collected. On a subframe basis, the autocovariance function of each of the 30 sequences shows a pseudoperiodic property. The actual shape of each function, however, depends on the scenes in that particular video segment. A finite-state machine representation was proposed to describe the probabilistic behavior of the aggregate packet-rate process when video sources are statistically multiplexed. With appropriate parameters, the model matches the empirical data very well and can be used for the development of protocols and control schemes for ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.64088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.64088","startPage":"881","endPage":"885 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","pdfPath":"/iel2/808/2325/00064088.pdf","publicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and analysis for packet video","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and analysis for packet video","conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 1989","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3719168","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64088/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and analysis for packet video","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00064088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02337S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","isNumber":"2325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"808","citationCount":"19","articleId":"64088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":64089,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Transport-level protocol functions (such as delay compensation, flow control, and error control) required to support real-time video at an acceptable quality level are identified and discussed. A simulation model used for assessing the performance of the LAN with several video and data users is described. The model provides quantitative measures of network performance (such as packet loss or delay vs. throughput). Preliminary performance evaluation results demonstrate that, with appropriate transport-level delay compensation, potentially acceptable video and data quality levels can be provided on a well-loaded ( approximately 55%) CSMA/CD LAN. With appropriate transport buffering, acceptably low video packet loss rates can be achieved, although the corresponding subjective quality has yet to be established.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00064089.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.64089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2325","publicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","pdfPath":"/iel2/808/2325/00064089.pdf","endPage":"892 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet transport of VBR interframe DCT compressed digital video on a CSMA/CD LAN","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.64089","startPage":"886","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=64089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"Packet transport of VBR interframe DCT compressed digital video on a CSMA/CD LAN","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64089/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3730297","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet transport of VBR interframe DCT compressed digital video on a CSMA/CD LAN","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00064089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053622S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","isNumber":"2325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"808","citationCount":"14","articleId":"64089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":64112,"authors":[{"name":"W.C.

They define four classes of scheduling strategies: (1) fully dynamic; (2) static assignment; (3) self-timed; and (4) fully static. Moving from (1) to (4), more scheduling activity is performed at compile time and less at run time. The authors argue that for most DSP applications, self-timed scheduling is the most attractive strategy. In this strategy, the assignment of actors to processors and the ordering of the firing of actors are determined by a compiler. Only the timing of the firing is determined at run time. The run-time cost of this determination is minimal. Furthermore, automatic scheduling techniques that fit this model are growing in generality and efficiency.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.64160","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00064160.png","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","pdfPath":"/iel2/808/2325/00064160.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.64160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2325","publicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","startPage":"1279","endPage":"1283 vol.2","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 1989","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling strategies for multiprocessor real-time DSP","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3706293","publicationDate":"1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64160/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling strategies for multiprocessor real-time DSP","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00064160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064188S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","isNumber":"2325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"808","citationCount":"59","articleId":"64160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":64163,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

The use of an onboard linearizer as well as a ground-based linearizer for M-QAM is also considered.

The discrepancies between the empirical distribution of the arriving paths and Poisson arrivals are discovered. The modified Poisson process is shown to fit the arriving paths closely. Rayleigh, Weibull, Nakagami, log-normal, and Suzuki distributions are considered as potential models for the amplitude of the arriving paths. The path amplitudes are shown to closely follow a log-normal rather than a Rayleigh distribution. The delay power spectrum is shown to fit an exponential function closely. The statistics of RMS multipath delay spread and the values of the distance/power law gradient are also computed and compared for these experimental sites. The interarrival times of the signals were modeled by the Weibull distribution. A model for the distribution of the number of signals was presented using the modified Beta distribution. Finally, for the data with no threshold at the receiver a suitable model for the distribution of the gain coefficients is found to be the log-normal distribution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.64171","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","pdfPath":"/iel2/808/2325/00064171.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.64171","publicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","startPage":"1346","endPage":"1350 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the modeling of fading multipath indoor radio channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=64171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"On the modeling of fading multipath indoor radio channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64171/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3719223","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the modeling of fading multipath indoor radio channels","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00064171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039843S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","isNumber":"2325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"808","citationCount":"35","articleId":"64171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":64194,"authors":[{"name":"X.

The bit-parallel banyan MIN is used to minimize delay in executing all switching functions which are required for integrated services. A group switching protocol for video traffic is proposed in order to satisfy video delay constraints, and analytic models are developed to determine the switch's performance characteristics. It is shown that the switch readily achieves low delay and small blocking-and-loss probability for video traffic while still being able to utilize the remaining system bandwidth to serve voice and data traffic.

In the present work, a combinatorial model with general applicability to the calculation of the statistics at the digital matched filter output, considering the correlation properties of the spread spectrum codes used, is presented. The model provides exact results not only for the case of mainlobe processing but also for the processing of sidelobes of the correlation functions of pseudonoise waveforms.

The inner software output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA) accepts and delivers soft sample values and can be regraded as a device for improving the signal-to-noise ratio, similar to an FM demodulator. Several applications are investigated to show the gain over the conventional hard-deciding VA, including concatenated convolutional codes, concatenation of trellis-coded modulation with convolutional FEC (forward error correcting) codes, and coded Viterbi equalization. For these applications additional gains of 1-4 dB as compared to the classical hard-deciding algorithms were found.

The authors formulate optimal (block) detection under the assumption of unknown carrier phase. Performance analysis and simulation show significant improvement with increasing blocklength, but complexity increases exponentially in blocklength. Suboptimal methods are then proposed which have far less complexity, but retain the improvement over standard DPSK.

The results of the Ungerboeck approach concerning the optimal design of coding by taking account of the modulation are summarized. The method used by Calderbank allows the global definition of families of coded modulations using the same convolutional code. For the 2/sup N/QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) modulations with rate (N-1)/N, the maximum attainable coding gain is related to the trellis complexity, exactly to the number of states in the Viterbi decoder and is nearly independent of the number of states of the modulation. OQAM with rate 2/3 gives the performances and the optimal receiver structure for all the modulations of the family. The results shows that the receiver can be implemented in two circuits, a preprocessor and a Viterbi decoder, this structure being suited to the reception of modulations with different rates and using the same convolutional code.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.64233","publicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","pdfPath":"/iel2/808/2325/00064233.pdf","startPage":"1698","endPage":"1702 vol.3","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00064233.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.64233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The 2/sup N/QAM modulations of rate (N-1)/N","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=64233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64233/","displayDocTitle":"The 2/sup N/QAM modulations of rate (N-1)/N","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3741546","conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The 2/sup N/QAM modulations of rate (N-1)/N","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00064233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027511S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","isNumber":"2325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"808","articleId":"64233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":64242,"authors":[{"name":"O.C.M.B.

In both strategies the retransmission request decision between selective repeat and continuous retransmission is based on an imminent buffer overflow condition. These are accumulative acknowledgement schemes, but in the second strategy the selective-repeat control frame is uniquely an individual negative acknowledgement. The two strategies take advantage of the availability of a greater buffer capacity, making the most of the selective repeat, postponing the sending of a continuous retransmission request. Numerical results show a better performance very close to the ideal, but it does not integrally conform to the high-level data link control (HDLC) procedures.

This technique was implemented using a custom LSI processor, and it was confirmed that the speech quality degradation caused by cell loss was sufficiently reduced.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition 'Communications Technology for the 1990s and Beyond'","pdfPath":"/iel2/808/2325/00064273.pdf","startPage":"1926","endPage":"1930 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new missing ATM cell reconstruction scheme for ADPCM-coded speech","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.64273","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00064273.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1989.64273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=64273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"A new missing ATM cell reconstruction scheme for ADPCM-coded speech","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3741577","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new missing ATM cell reconstruction scheme for ADPCM-coded speech","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00064273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047409S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov 1989","isNumber":"2325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"808","citationCount":"2","articleId":"64273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":64343,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In the amplification of an isolated pulse whose repetition period is short compared to the carrier lifetime, the gain saturation is related through the carrier lifetime to the gain saturation in CW amplification. When the output pulse energy is smaller than the saturation energy, short optical pulses can be amplified without pulse shape distortion, whereas high-energy pulses suffer from pulse shape distortion due to the temporal gain variation during the pulse radiation. FWHM pulse duration variation in amplification by TWAs depends on the input pulse shape. The pulse energy gain saturation was experimentally confirmed to be independent of pulse durations and to be determined only by the pulse energy. In extremely-high-repetition-rate pulse amplification, the saturation of the pulse energy gain is determined by the average signal power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.64343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.64343","startPage":"2086","endPage":"2094","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/2327/00064343.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2327","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00064343.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gain saturation characteristics of traveling-wave semiconductor laser amplifiers in short optical pulse amplification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Gain saturation characteristics of traveling-wave semiconductor laser amplifiers in short optical pulse amplification","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"26","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3868611","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64343/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gain saturation characteristics of traveling-wave semiconductor laser amplifiers in short optical pulse amplification","sourcePdf":"00064343.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04029S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"21","articleId":"64343","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":64345,"authors":[{"name":"M.

When a sequence of laser pulses is applied, the interaction of the acoustic transients with gas bubbles remaining from preceding laser exposures is also important. To distinguish the effects caused by the different physical mechanisms, laser pulses were aimed directly onto the corneal endothelium, through the cornea, and parallel to the cornea at various distances. Simultaneously, the cavitation bubble size was determined. The damage range of the acoustic transients produced by a 4 mJ laser pulse is several millimeters, when they can interact with small gas bubbles attached to the corneal endothelium.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64361/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3868628","volume":"26","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Intraocular Nd:YAG laser surgery: laser-tissue interaction, damage range, and reduction of collateral effects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intraocular Nd:YAG laser surgery: laser-tissue interaction, damage range, and reduction of collateral effects","sourcePdf":"00064361.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068407S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"141","articleId":"64361","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":64383,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

The topics covered include mathematical modeling of various types of traffic sources, congestion-control and error-control schemes for ATM networks, and priority schemes to support multiple classes of traffic. Standard activity for ATM networks and future research problems in ATM are also presented. It is shown that the cell-arrival process for data sources can be modeled by a simple Poisson process. However, voice sources or video sources require more complex processes because of the correlation among cell arrivals. Due to the effects of high-speed channels, preventive control is more effective in ATM networks than reactive control. Due to the use of optical fibers in ATM networks, the channel error rate is very small. The effects of propagation delay and processing time become significant in such high-speed networks. These fundamental changes trigger the necessity to reexamine the error-control schemes used in existing networks. Due to the diversity of service and performance requirements, the notion of multiple traffic classes is required, and separate control mechanisms should be used according to the traffic classes. The priority scheme is shown to be an effective method to support multiple classes of traffic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64405/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"79","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3872855","displayDocTitle":"Survey of traffic control schemes and protocols in ATM networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survey of traffic control schemes and protocols in ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00064405.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08119S","chronDate":"Feb.  1991","isNumber":"2329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"210","articleId":"64405","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":64409,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-Q.

The single receiver structure allows only output power for a given set of weights to be measured. The problem, then, is to adaptively adjust the weights of the antenna array based on output power measurements only so as to reject interference signals while maintaining a fixed response in a given look direction. The authors determine the optimal beamformer weights in a single step, by estimating the covariance matrix of the array sensor outputs using a weight perturbation technique. Based on this covariance matrix estimate, three different approaches for finding the beamformer weights are studied. The first corresponds to a sample matrix inversion scheme, with the sample covariance matrix replaced by the one obtained from the perturbation estimation method, while in the second approach the weights are determined using an eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix estimate. In the third approach the directions-of-arrival (DOAs) of the incoming wavefronts are first estimated, and then, in a second step, the beamformer weights are calculated from the DOA estimates. The advantage of the third approach is that this method is not affected by correlation between the different sources.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.64430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2330","startPage":"21","endPage":"28","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/2330/00064430.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental and theoretical comparison of some algorithms for beamforming in single receiver adaptive arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64430/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Experimental and theoretical comparison of some algorithms for beamforming in single receiver adaptive arrays","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3868298","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental and theoretical comparison of some algorithms for beamforming in single receiver adaptive arrays","sourcePdf":"00064430.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044996S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"15","articleId":"64430","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":64431,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

First, FDTD requires that at each time step the permittivity and conductivity be specified as constants that do not depend on frequency, while even for the simplest plasmas these parameters vary with frequency. Second, the permittivity of a plasma can be negative, which can cause terms in FDTD expressions to become singular. A novel FDTD formulation for frequency-dependent materials (FD)/sup 2/TD has been developed. It is shown that (FD)/sup 2/TD can be applied to compute transient propagation in plasma when the plasma can be characterized by a complex frequency-dependent permittivity. While the computational example presented is for a pulse normally incident on an isotropic plasma slab, the (FD)/sup 2/TD formulation is fully three-dimensional. It can accommodate arbitrary transient excitation, with the limitation that the excitation pulse must have no zero frequency energy component. Time-varying electron densities and/or collision frequencies could also be included. The formulation presented is for an isotropic plasma, but extension to anisotropic plasma should be fairly straightforward.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00064431.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/2330/00064431.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"34","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.64431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.64431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2330","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=64431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A frequency-dependent finite-difference time-domain formulation for transient propagation in plasma","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Plasma materials processing","Permittivity","Plasma density","Conductivity","Conducting materials","Slabs","Electrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["difference equations","electromagnetic wave propagation in plasma","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-varying electron densities","EM wave propagation","frequency-dependent finite-difference time-domain formulation","transient propagation","plasma","FDTD formulation","frequency-dependent materials","(FD)/sup 2/TD","complex frequency-dependent permittivity","isotropic plasma slab","arbitrary transient excitation","collision frequencies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","displayDocTitle":"A frequency-dependent finite-difference time-domain formulation for transient propagation in plasma","volume":"39","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3868299","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A frequency-dependent finite-difference time-domain formulation for transient propagation in plasma","sourcePdf":"00064431.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041668S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"281","articleId":"64431","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":64434,"authors":[{"name":"O.M.

The technique combines the finite element and boundary integral methods to formulate a system of equations for the solution of the aperture fields and those inside the cavity. Specifically, the finite element method is used to formulate the fields in the cavity region, and the boundary integral approach is used in conjunction with the equivalence principle to represent the fields above the ground plane. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed technique does not require a knowledge of the cavity's Green's function and is, therefore, applicable to arbitrary shape depressions and material fillings. Furthermore, the proposed formulation leads to a system having a partly full and partly sparse as well as symmetric and banded matrix which can be solved efficiently using special algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00064442.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/2330/00064442.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.64442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.64442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2330","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=64442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A finite-element-boundary integral formulation for scattering by three-dimensional cavity-backed apertures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Apertures","Integral equations","Shape","Electromagnetic scattering","Admittance","Moment methods","Finite difference methods","Filling","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boundary-value problems","electromagnetic wave scattering","finite element analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EM wave scattering","symmetric banded matrix","finite-element-boundary integral formulation","three-dimensional cavity-backed apertures","infinite ground plane","finite element method","boundary integral approach","equivalence principle","arbitrary shape depressions","material fillings"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","displayDocTitle":"A finite-element-boundary integral formulation for scattering by three-dimensional cavity-backed apertures","volume":"39","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3868310","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A finite-element-boundary integral formulation for scattering by three-dimensional cavity-backed apertures","sourcePdf":"00064442.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047129S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"192","articleId":"64442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":64448,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

Accelerometers with a potential for implantation are studied as detectors for the swing phase of walking to replace footswitches. Theoretically, one can show that accelerometers can be used to distinguish between stance and swing phase. Using accelerometers attached between the ankle and knee joints, the equivalent acceleration of the ankle joint was calculated. This resulted in a typical and reproducible signal in which the different walking phases were identified. Automatic detection algorithms based on cross-correlation calculations were developed and tested. Measurements from four healthy and four hemiplegic subjects resulted in a total of 317 and 272 steps, respectively. The testing of one of the hemiplegic subjects was considered to be a failure due to large disturbances in the acceleration signal during the swing phase of walking, which may be related to the use of crutches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic stance-swing phase detection from accelerometer data for peroneal nerve stimulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.64463","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/2331/00064463.pdf","startPage":"1201","endPage":"1208","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00064463.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.64463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2331","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=64463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64463/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Automatic stance-swing phase detection from accelerometer data for peroneal nerve stimulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3868461","pubMedId":"2289794","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic stance-swing phase detection from accelerometer data for peroneal nerve stimulation","sourcePdf":"00064463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037793S","chronDate":"Dec.  1990","isNumber":"2331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"118","articleId":"64463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":64464,"authors":[{"name":"Z.A.

It provides full HDTV performance with virtually no visible transmission impairments due to noise, multipath, and interference. It offers high picture quality, while the complexity of the decoder is low. Furthermore, low transmitting power can be used, making it ideal for simulcast HDTV transmission using unused or prohibited channels. DigiCipher can also be used for cable and satellite transmission of HDTV. There is no satellite receive dish size penalty (compared to FM-NTSC) in the satellite delivery of DigiCipher HDTV. To achieve the full HDTV performance in a single 6 MHz bandwidth, a highly efficient unique compression algorithm based on DCT (discrete cosine transform) transform coding is used. Through the extensive use of computer simulation, the compression algorithm has been refined and optimized. Computer simulation results show excellent video quality for a variety of HDTV material. For error-free transmission of the digital data, power error correction coding combined with adaptive equalization is used. At a carrier-to-noise ratio of above 19 dB, essentially error-free reception can be achieved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/11.64474","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00064474.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel1/11/2332/00064474.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.64474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","startPage":"245","endPage":"254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DigiCipher-all digital, channel compatible, HDTV broadcast system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=64474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1990","displayDocTitle":"DigiCipher-all digital, channel compatible, HDTV broadcast system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64474/","volume":"36","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3868318","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DigiCipher-all digital, channel compatible, HDTV broadcast system","sourcePdf":"00064474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047141S","chronDate":"Dec.  1990","isNumber":"2332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"20","articleId":"64474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":64559,"authors":[{"name":"T.-S.

This method uses the moment method to find the currents in the microstrip circuits and subsequently the scattering parameters of the junctions. In this approach, all the physical effects are considered, including radiation and surface waves. The numerical results for a T- and a cross-junction are presented and agree well with the quasi-static values at low frequencies. The S-parameters of a T-junction are further compared with the measured results, with excellent agreement. The utilization of a shaped T-junction as a broadband equal-power divider is also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00064564.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/2335/00064564.pdf","startPage":"1837","endPage":"1844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.64564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.64564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=64564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A rigorous dispersive characterization of microstrip cross and T junctions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dispersion","Microstrip","Moment methods","Scattering parameters","Feeds","Integral equations","Transmission line discontinuities","Surface waves","Microwave circuits","Waveguide discontinuities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersion (wave)","S-parameters","strip line components"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersive characterization","T junctions","full-wave spectral-domain analysis","multiport microstrip discontinuities","moment method","microstrip circuits","scattering parameters","radiation","surface waves","S-parameters","broadband equal-power divider"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"A rigorous dispersive characterization of microstrip cross and T junctions","volume":"38","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3868396","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A rigorous dispersive characterization of microstrip cross and T junctions","sourcePdf":"00064564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051031S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"87","articleId":"64564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":64565,"authors":[{"name":"M.N.

The design includes both the higher order mode interaction between the step discontinuities and the finite step and branch heights. The phase shifter design applies the Schiffman principle to branch guide couplers where two ports are short-circuited. The 180 degrees coupler design combines the advantage of the broadband potential of multiple-branch couplers with the low-insertion-loss qualities of E-plane stub-loaded phase shifters. A computer-optimized phase shifter prototype for the waveguide Ku-band (12-18 GHz) shows a 90 degrees +or-1 degrees differential phase shift with reference to an empty waveguide within about 23% bandwidth. Five-branch three-stub coupler prototypes, designed for 3+or-0.2 dB coupling, for the waveguide Ku- and Ka-bands (26-40 GHz) achieve a 180 degrees +or-1 degrees differential phase shift at the output ports within about 19% bandwidth, as well as more than 30 dB isolation and return loss.

This analysis has the advantage of being performed in the space domain, which allows the electric and magnetic field distributions in the whole space to be determined directly without the use of an inverse Fourier transform. An experimental method is given for the measurement of the reactance of a CPW short circuit end that allows its radiation resistance to be determined. It is shown that this resistance increases with frequency. Two examples of calculated results that give the electric field distribution in the two slots are given. The first one represents a CPW mode (odd mode), while the second represent an even coupled slots mode. The normalized reactance obtained by the present theory is compared with previously obtained measurements. The comparison shows a very good agreement. The results of a comparative study of the short-end equivalent impedance for a slotline and a CPW having the same slot width operating once in the odd mode (coplanar mode) and another time in the even mode are given. The results clearly show that the CPW operating in the odd mode has very low radiation properties when compared with the slotline and coupled slotlines operating in the even mode.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.64613","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/2336/00064613.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"116","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00064613.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.64613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of coplanar waveguide radiating end effects using the integral equation technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=64613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64613/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of coplanar waveguide radiating end effects using the integral equation technique","volume":"39","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3868436","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of coplanar waveguide radiating end effects using the integral equation technique","sourcePdf":"00064613.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079998S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"33","articleId":"64613","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":64620,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

The good performance, together with fast decoding make these techniques attractive for applications such as low-bit-rate coding of speech.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Bit rate","Speech coding","Linear predictive coding","Predictive models","Technological innovation","Signal to noise ratio","Block codes","Decoding","Video compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","delays","error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correcting codes","speech coding","high SNR","finite-delay quantization","Gaussian source","codebooks","fractional bit rate","rate-one-half codes","stretched Golay codes","block codes","trellis-coded quantization","block lengths","decoding","low-bit-rate coding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/26.64647","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00064647.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2338/00064647.pdf","startPage":"2089","endPage":"2093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.64647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The 'stretched'-Golay and other codes for high-SNR finite-delay quantization of the Gaussian source at 1/2 bit per sample","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=64647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The 'stretched'-Golay and other codes for high-SNR finite-delay quantization of the Gaussian source at 1/2 bit per sample","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64647/","volume":"38","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3868730","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The 'stretched'-Golay and other codes for high-SNR finite-delay quantization of the Gaussian source at 1/2 bit per sample","sourcePdf":"00064647.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034921S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","articleId":"64647","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":64648,"authors":[{"name":"Ahn Seung Choon","affiliation":["Department of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Training Institute of Korea Telecommunications, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ahn Seung Choon","id":"38164107200"},{"name":"Lee Moon Ho","affiliation":["Department of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, Cheongju, South Korea"],"lastName":"Lee Moon Ho","id":"37279700800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"64648","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Binary phase shift keying","Phase change materials","Speech","Gaussian channels","Transmitters","Interpolation","Pulse modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Silicon compounds","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase shift keying","pulse-code modulation","signal detection","speech analysis and processing","telecommunication channels","voice communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable threshold detection","Gaussian channel","weighted pulse code modulation","encoded signals","encoded PCM word","SNR","transmitter","erasure zone","receiver","output signal","weighted energy","interpolation","BPSK/PCM speech signals"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=64648","abstract":"Varible threshold detection with weighted pulse code modulation encoded signals transmitted over Gaussian channel is investigated. In general, the bits in any encoded PCM word are transmitted with equal energy on all transmitted bits.

In VPIC, set of visual-patterns is defined independent of the images to be coded. Each visual pattern is a subimage of limited spatial support that is visually meaningful to a normal human observer. The patterns are used as a basis for efficient image representation; since it is assumed that the images to be coded are natural optical images to be viewed by human observers, visual pattern design is developed using relevant psychophysical and physiological data. Although VPIC bears certain resemblances to block truncation (BTC) and vector quantification (VQ) image coding, there are important differences. First, there is no training phase required: the visual patterns derive from models of perceptual mechanisms; second, the assignment of patterns to image regions is not based on a standard (norm) error criterion; expensive search operations are eliminated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.64656","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00064656.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2338/00064656.pdf","startPage":"2137","endPage":"2146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.64656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=64656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual pattern image coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64656/","displayDocTitle":"Visual pattern image coding","volume":"38","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3868739","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual pattern image coding","sourcePdf":"00064656.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044867S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"83","articleId":"64656","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":64657,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Pseudo-Gray coding provides a redundancy-free error protection scheme for vector quantization (VQ) of analog signals when the binary indexes are used as channel symbols on a discrete memoryless channel and the points are signal codevectors. Binary indexes are assigned to codevectors in a way that reduces the average quantization distortion introduced in the reproduced source vectors when a transmitted index is corrupted by channel noise. A globally optimal solution to this problem is generally intractable due to an inherently large computational complexity. A locally optimal solution, the binary switching algorithm, is introduced, based on the objective of minimizing a useful upper bound on the average system distortion. The algorithm yields a significant reduction in average distortion, and converges in reasonable running times. The sue of pseudo-Gray coding is motivated by the increasing need for low-bit-rate VQ-based encoding systems that operate on noisy channels, such as in mobile radio speech communications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64657/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3868740","volume":"38","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Pseudo-Gray coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pseudo-Gray coding","sourcePdf":"00064657.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088189S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"288","articleId":"64657","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":64725,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The use of the relational model together with an extended structured-query-language-like query language to describe 800 service, network automatic call distribution, and directory-assisted call completion services, is examined. The architectural constraints on the scalability of traditional database systems is reviewed, and an alternative, the Datacycle architecture is presented. The Datacycle approach exploits the bandwidth of fiber optics to circulate database contents among processing nodes (e.g. switching offices or other network elements) in a network, providing highly flexible access to data and controlling the administrative and processing overhead of coordinating changes to database contents.

In the short-range model, the received signal is due to a direct path (steady component) and a random path (diffused component) that could be the result of boundary scattering. For the long-range case, the received signal is the superposition of a number of time-delayed, randomly propagated components arriving by different paths.

Output from each receiver is assigned a quality measure based on the estimated error rate, and the data, weighted by the quality measure, are combined and decoded. The quality measure is derived from a Viterbi error-correction decoder operating on each receiver and is shown to perform reliability in a variety of non-Gaussian noise and jamming environments and reduce to the traditional optimal diversity system in a Gaussian environment. The dynamics of the quality estimator allow operation in the presence of high-power impulsive interference by exploiting the signal and noise differential travel times to individual sensors. The spatial coherence structure of the shallow water acoustic channel shows relatively low signal coherence at separations as short as 0.35 m. Increasing receiver spacing beyond 5 m offers additional benefits in the presence of impulsive noise and larger-scale inhomogeneities in the acoustic field. A number of data transmission experiments were carried out to demonstrate system performance in realistic underwater environments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/48.64888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.64888","endPage":"97","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/2349/00064888.pdf","startPage":"86","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial diversity processing for underwater acoustic telemetry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64888/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial diversity processing for underwater acoustic telemetry","volume":"16","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3880484","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial diversity processing for underwater acoustic telemetry","sourcePdf":"00064888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030951S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"21","articleId":"64888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":64895,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This application best exploits the presence of the human operator while making full use of available robot control technology and computing power. A physically motivated, passivity-based formalism is used to provide energy conservation and stability guarantees in the presence of transmission delays. The notion of wave variable is utilized to characterize time-delay systems and leads to a configuration for force-reflecting teleoperation. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated experimentally. Within the same framework, an adaptive tracking controller is incorporated for the control of the remote robotic system and can be used to simplify, transform, or enhance the remote dynamics perceived by the operator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/2349/00064895.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"162","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doi":"10.1109/48.64895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.64895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2349","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=64895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable adaptive teleoperation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application software","Telerobotics","Robot control","Control systems","Space technology","Humans","Cognitive robotics","Control theory","Cognitive science","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","delays","robots","stability","telecontrol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecontrol","adaptive teleoperation","transmission time delays","robot control","force-reflecting telerobotic systems","energy conservation","stability","wave variable","adaptive tracking controller","remote robotic system","remote dynamics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/64895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Stable adaptive teleoperation","volume":"16","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3880491","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable adaptive teleoperation","sourcePdf":"00064895.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031871S","chronDate":"Jan.  1991","isNumber":"2349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"1010","articleId":"64895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":64900,"authors":[{"name":"D.W.

(1) If wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) of two channels is used in a uniform fiber without dispersion fluctuations, catastrophic buildup of four-wave mixing occurs if one primary channel is located at the zero-dispersion wavelength. (2) If two pulses with different carrier frequencies collide in a uniform fiber with no gain or loss discontinuities, their four-wave mixing products reach a peak during complete pulse overlap, but this spurious power dies away as the pulses separate.

The assumption made is that the sampling rate is sufficiently high, as dictated by the sampling theorem. It is shown that the models are linear for small signal operation but represent a bilinear discrete system under large signal conditions. The models could be useful for the design of microprocessor-based controllers for switched mode converters, with improved transient response. Two examples of possible applications of the model are discussed: as a fast and efficient time-domain simulator and as a tool for the analysis and design of a fast turn-on boost converter. Experimental measurement and computer simulation of the responses to large steps of the duty ratio in a boost converter demonstrate the accuracy of the model at the tested low-frequency region. The bilinear model can be used as a simulation tool for fast and efficient computer-aided analysis and design. The main limitation of the model is its restriction to the low-frequency range.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.65003","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/2356/00065003.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"61","doi":"10.1109/63.65003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-frequency sampled-data models of switched mode DC-DC converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Low-frequency sampled-data models of switched mode DC-DC converters","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3882055","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/65003/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-frequency sampled-data models of switched mode DC-DC converters","sourcePdf":"00065003.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032415S","chronDate":"Jan.  1991","isNumber":"2356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"45","articleId":"65003","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":65010,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

Current feedback information is provided by current sensors integrated into MOS-gated power switches (MOSFETs and IGBTs), and the current regulation is performed by gate drive power integrated circuits. A high degree of drive circuit integration is achieved with this scheme, in addition to providing protection against dangerous fault currents not sensed by conventional bus-shunt configurations. Available power semiconductor switches and power integrated circuits make this technique applicable to permanent magnet ECM drives operating at bus supply voltages up to 500 VDC with power ratings from fractional to >10 hp.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/63.65010","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/2356/00065010.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.65010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated current regulation for a brushless ECM drive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=65010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/65010/","displayDocTitle":"Integrated current regulation for a brushless ECM drive","volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3882059","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated current regulation for a brushless ECM drive","sourcePdf":"00065010.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038364S","chronDate":"Jan.  1991","isNumber":"2356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"73","articleId":"65010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":65012,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The concept is applicable to all classes of converters. Compared to QR converters with conventional switch realization, constant-frequency quasi-resonant (CF-QR) converters exhibit the same type of switching transitions and similar switch voltage and current stresses. Advantages of CF-QR converters are not restricted to the constant-frequency control. In all classes, operation at zero load is possible, so that the available load range is unlimited. The range of attainable, conversion ratios is significantly extended in the classes of zero-voltage quasi-square-wave (CF-ZV-QSW) and zero-voltage multiresonant (CF-ZV-MR) topologies. A practical design example of a 25 W CF-ZV-MR buck converter is constructed and evaluated. The converter operates at 2 MHz from zero load to full load, with a full-load efficiency of 83%. Simple duty ratio control is used to maintain the output voltage constant for all loads. The circuit is inherently immune to the short-circuit condition at the output. Disadvantages of CF-QR converters are the increased gate-drive losses and increased complexity of the power stage and the control circuitry.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/65012/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1991","volume":"6","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3882061","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Constant-frequency control of quasi-resonant converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant-frequency control of quasi-resonant converters","sourcePdf":"00065012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03274S","chronDate":"Jan.  1991","isNumber":"2356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"103","articleId":"65012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":65013,"authors":[{"name":"D.

For a given minimum ON-time and, consequently, for a given minimum duty ratio D/sub min/, D/sup 2/ in the numerator of M(D) yields a much lower limit on the minimum attainable conversion ratio. By applying a systematic synthesis procedure, six novel single-transistor converter configurations with quadratic DC conversion ratios are found. The simpler, single-transistor realization is the most important advantage over the straightforward cascade of two basic converters. As far as conversion efficiency is concerned, it is clear that a single-stage converter is usually a better choice than a two-stage converter. The quadratic converters proposed are intended for applications where conventional single-stage converters are inadequate-for high-frequency applications where the specified range of input voltages and the specified range of output voltages call for an extremely large range of conversion ratios.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/2356/00065013.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"157","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/63.65013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.65013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2356","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=65013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switching converters with wide DC conversion range","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switching converters","Switches","Voltage","Pulse width modulation converters","Circuit topology","Buck converters","Switching frequency","Frequency conversion","Power supplies","Power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power convertors","pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discontinuous mode","continuous mode","buck converter","boost converter","buck-boost converter","Cuk converter","wide DC conversion range","converter topologies","pulse-width modulation","PWM","quadratic DC conversion ratios","single-transistor converter","high-frequency applications","20 W","60 W","1 to 60 V"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/65013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Switching converters with wide DC conversion range","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3870463","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switching converters with wide DC conversion range","sourcePdf":"00065013.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037889S","chronDate":"Jan.  1991","isNumber":"2356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"441","articleId":"65013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":65060,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

Moreover, this technique is significantly faster than the usual method where several host instructions are executed to emulate the effect of executing a single instruction of the target processor. The cross-profiling technique is introduced, and it is shown how it can be combined with execution-driven simulation.

Using this algorithm, one can initially put a set of seed neurons in the network and then let the network grow according to the training patterns.

Using the description language defined by J.F. Sowa (1984) provides a convenient way of expressing the knowledge and the properties used by the algorithm. This graph description makes it possible to better manage learning problems, define new methods, and present results in a familiar and practical way. A learning system INNE has been developed which is based on this kind of description language. The goal is to design a learning algorithm which allows the processing of a considerable amount of data in a reasonable time. This kind of learning engine has been successfully tested on a real problem in biology. Thus, an experimental basis and a validation of the method have been acquired.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TAI.1989.65304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAI.1989.65304","startPage":"70","endPage":"76","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1989] IEEE International Workshop on Tools for Artificial Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel2/262/2361/00065304.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1989] IEEE International Workshop on Tools for Artificial Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"INNE: a structured learning algorithm for noisy examples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"INNE: a structured learning algorithm for noisy examples","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 1989","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3685440","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/65304/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"INNE: a structured learning algorithm for noisy examples","confLoc":"Fairfax, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00065304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028576S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct 1989","isNumber":"2361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"262","citationCount":"1","articleId":"65304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":65322,"authors":[{"name":"W.F.

It is shown to be universal, correct, and optimal with respect to time. Its correctness is due to the following facts: the engine is invoked when attributes change, conditions are checked when their attributes take values, rules are examined whenever their conditions change, and actions are executed when their rules are fired. Optimality of execution time is primarily due to the fact that nothing is done which does not need doing. In particular, nothing happens until attributes change value, conditions are evaluated only if their attributes are defined, and rules are examined only when their conditions are true. Another reason for the efficiency of the inference engine is that it is a finite-state machine which operates on a graph rather than a tree. A VLSI implementation of the system that allows automatic design of universal as well as special-purpose expert systems on a chip is proposed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TAI.1989.65327","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1989] IEEE International Workshop on Tools for Artificial Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1989] IEEE International Workshop on Tools for Artificial Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel2/262/2361/00065327.pdf","startPage":"246","endPage":"251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAI.1989.65327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A rule-based inference engine which is optimal and VLSI implementable","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=65327","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/65327/","displayDocTitle":"A rule-based inference engine which is optimal and VLSI implementable","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3685460","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A rule-based inference engine which is optimal and VLSI implementable","confLoc":"Fairfax, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00065327.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036354S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct 1989","isNumber":"2361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"262","citationCount":"11","articleId":"65327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":65355,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The classifier-based model (CBM) uses internal representations of objects automatically developed from observation. A feedback loop consisting of a Coulomb network is introduced into a classifier network. The classifier learns descriptions of various object types from observation of typical instances. The internal representations of the classifier are used by the Coulomb network to transform an incomplete or noisy input dynamically. Since the recall is based on abstract object descriptions, the output is not limited to an a priori specified collection of memories (objects). Results obtained for a simulation of the model show that it will retrieve a memory which satisfies the classification requirement and is compatible with the cue. The model can store any number of memories without degrading the quality of the memory retrieved. Either a schema or a distinct memory can be retrieved. The classifier prunes irrelevant objects from the object space, promoting faster convergence to an appropriate memory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Associative memory","Prototypes","Impedance matching","Computer science","Feedback loop","Automatic control","Neurofeedback","Decision making","Glass"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classification","content-addressable storage","feedback","learning systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning by observation","incomplete input","memory retrieval","abstract object descriptions","CBM neural net model","associative recall","classifier-based model","internal representations","feedback loop","Coulomb network","classifier network","object types","noisy input","simulation","cue","schema","irrelevant objects","convergence"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAI.1989.65355","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00065355.png","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1989] IEEE International Workshop on Tools for Artificial Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1989] IEEE International Workshop on Tools for Artificial Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel2/262/2361/00065355.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAI.1989.65355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Associative recall based on abstract object descriptions learned from observation: the CBM neural net model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=65355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Associative recall based on abstract object descriptions learned from observation: the CBM neural net model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/65355/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3706617","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Associative recall based on abstract object descriptions learned from observation: the CBM neural net model","confLoc":"Fairfax, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00065355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052916S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct 1989","isNumber":"2361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"262","citationCount":"2","articleId":"65355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":65366,"authors":[{"name":"Hahn-Ming Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hahn-Ming Lee","id":"37087215741"},{"name":"Ching-Chi Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Chi Hsu","id":"37087147781"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-1984-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"65366","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=65366","abstract":"Defines a neural network model NNCO for the multiconstraint zero-one knapsack problem and presents a methodology to solve this problem approximately in near real-time by use of the characteristic that many neural networks can be shown to minimize an energy function defined for the networks.

They concentrate on the subclass of quadric surfaces, mainly planes, cylinders, and spheres. The underlying assumption is that the different surfaces are textured. The authors adopt a model-based approach, wherein in the sensed image data that emanate from a 3-D surface patch are locally approximated by a homogeneous Markov random field (MRF) texture model which is parameterized by a few (known or unknown) parameters. To classify a surface image patch successfully, allowance is made for a direct link between the image data and the surface from which they emanate. This is achieved by explicitly making the 3-D surface shape parameters, the camera geometry, and the scene lighting part of the MRF model structure.

Analysis of an image recorded on a CCD (charge coupled device) or photodiode array camera yields object profile information. In a prototype version, a depth resolution of 0.2 mm has been achieved for objects situated about 1 m away from the camera.

The lower-level subsystem adapts to environmental changes while the higher-level subsystem maintains a library of connection weights for a variety of distinct environments and loads the appropriate set of coefficients to the lower level following the recognition of the current environment. The conceptual design of the system is presented, as well as a qualitative analysis of the lower-level subsystem convergence performance using simulation results. The simulation results show that, rather than random initial weights, a prototype set obtained from a simple analytical model could markedly reduce the number of iterations. The proposed two-level neural net structure, by recalling from a library the appropriate set of connection weights, can bring down the number of iterations below 10, given that the recalled weights are within approximately 15% of the steady-state values.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/65485/","accessionNumber":"3685660","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A two-level neural network system for learning control of robot motion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two-level neural network system for learning control of robot motion","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00065485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034315S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug 1988","isNumber":"2362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"272","citationCount":"1","articleId":"65485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":65498,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The kinematic equation of an N-jointed manipulator involves the chain product of N homogeneous link transformation matrices and reveals the requirement for computing a large set of elementary operations: multiplications, additions, and trigonometric functions. Since these elementary operations, in general, cannot be efficiently computed in genera-purpose uniprocessor computers, the coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) algorithms are used. It is found that a general homogeneous link transformation matrix can be decomposed into a product of two matrices, each of which can be computed by two CORDIC processors arranged in parallel, forming a generic two-stage cascade CORDIC computational module.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.1988.65500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIC.1988.65500","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control 1988","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control 1988","pdfPath":"/iel2/272/2362/00065500.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CORDIC-based architectures for robot direct kinematics and Jacobian computations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/65500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug 1988","displayDocTitle":"CORDIC-based architectures for robot direct kinematics and Jacobian computations","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 1988","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3685675","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CORDIC-based architectures for robot direct kinematics and Jacobian computations","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00065500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035913S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug 1988","isNumber":"2362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"272","citationCount":"3","articleId":"65500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":65509,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

Starting with a dynamic joint model consisting of an agonistic-antagonist pair of actuators with musclelike properties, it is shown that transitions from one posture to another can be accomplished by adjusting the steady-state open-loop stiffness of the opposing muscle pair and modulating the reflex gains as functions of the system state to shape the transient response. A computational map neural network paradigm is used to calculate time-varying reflex gains that move the system towards the direction of minimum error. Simulation results show that desired phase-plane trajectories can be tracked fairly accurately using a reasonable number of repetitions to learn the motion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.1988.65509","startPage":"658","endPage":"664","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control 1988","pdfPath":"/iel2/272/2362/00065509.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control 1988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIC.1988.65509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network computational map approach to reflexive motor control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Computer networks","Humans","Motor drives","Encoding","Actuators","Steady-state","Muscles","Transient response","Time varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocontrol","biomechanics","muscle","neural nets","physiological models","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocontrol","biomechanics","neural network","computational map","reflexive motor control","reflex arcs","antagonistic actuation","neuronal populations","dynamic joint model","muscle","reflex gains","transient response"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/65509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug 1988","displayDocTitle":"A neural network computational map approach to reflexive motor control","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 1988","accessionNumber":"3685684","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network computational map approach to reflexive motor control","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00065509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035346S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug 1988","isNumber":"2362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"272","citationCount":"6","articleId":"65509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":65512,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Given a uniform line, the size of the buffer driving the line, and the value of the capacitive load driven by the line, the problem considered consists of determining the type, number, and position of buffers that minimize the delay in the line. A variation of this problem that is also considered consists of minimizing the delay in the line when the area occupied by the buffers is constrained; this leads to the solution of the problem of minimizing the delay in driving a pure capacitive load under buffer area constraint. The optimal solution is formally developed, and some very good approximate solutions that can be obtained via simple computations are presented. It is shown that accepting a small increase in delay (of usually 5% over the minimum) can lead to a significant (about 50%) decrease in the area occupied by the buffers. Design curves that allow the reader to determine the optimum buffers with little effort are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.65707","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2364/00065707.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.65707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2364","startPage":"32","endPage":"40","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00065707.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum buffer circuits for driving long uniform lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=65707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum buffer circuits for driving long uniform lines","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/65707/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3868262","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum buffer circuits for driving long uniform lines","sourcePdf":"00065707.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034019S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"109","articleId":"65707","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":65739,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Analytic signal processing is used to improve pulse resolution. A real-time analytic processor was built using single-sideband (SBB) AM techniques. An upper sideband processor using the filter method to maximize signal bandwidth and in which the lower sideband aliases was built. This processor has a transducer bandwidth of 0.5 to 20 MHz and can resolve echoes 90-ns apart. The spurious products of practical mixers and amplifiers make the aliased approach impractical due to high noise and distortion. By using a bandpass filter after the mixer, distortion is reduced. A processor built with a lower sideband filter method yielded the lowest distortion and noise. The lower sideband processor has a bandwidth of 2 to 42 MHz and can resolve echoes 60-ns apart. With a single-cycle tone-burst processor input, ringing in the IF filter causes temporal asymmetry of the output pulse, while ringing in the detector filter causes ringing in the output pulse. Performance is expected to improve through the design of optimized filters. The ringing is less with ultrasonic echoes, because they do not start and stop as abruptly as a tone burst.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/19.65819","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/2367/00065819.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.65819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2367","startPage":"1024","endPage":"1029","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00065819.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time analysis signal processor for ultrasonic nondestructive testing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=65819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time analysis signal processor for ultrasonic nondestructive testing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/65819/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3880039","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time analysis signal processor for ultrasonic nondestructive testing","sourcePdf":"00065819.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033921S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"15","articleId":"65819","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":65824,"authors":[{"name":"P.

For a current restricted to a plane, the inverse problem can theoretically be solved by a linear spatial filtering method. Experimental results indicate that currents restricted to the surface of a printed circuit board can be imaged using this method. To measure the magnetic field, a magnetic resonance imaging technique is used. The reconstructed current density images illustrate that a tradeoff exists between the spatial resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). The currents were restricted to the surface of a printed circuit board set in the xy plane. The circuit board was bathed in a nonconducting mineral oil to provide a magnetic resonance (MR) signal. The z component of the magnetic field produced by the current was measured using the magnetic resonance technique, and a spatial filtering technique was used to find the current density (J). The spatial resolution with which one can measure electric current density depends strongly on the distance at which the magnetic field from these currents can be measured. Magnetic resonance imaging offers a way to measure magnetic fields noninvasively and thus the possibility of reducing this distance to zero (if the current flows in an appropriate medium). While less sensitive than a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), the MR imaging method might, under certain circumstances, be capable of higher spatial resolution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/19.65824","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/2367/00065824.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.65824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2367","startPage":"1048","endPage":"1053","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00065824.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional current density imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=65824","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional current density imaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/65824/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3868494","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional current density imaging","sourcePdf":"00065824.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030703S","chronDate":"Dec 1990","isNumber":"2367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"27","articleId":"65824","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":65871,"authors":[{"name":"C.R.

Three operating modes of an amplifier lightwave system are identified and their relative signal power efficiency and noise performance are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.65871","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00065871.png","startPage":"147","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/2371/00065871.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.65871","endPage":"154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation of signal and noise in concatenated erbium-doped fiber optical amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/65871/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Propagation of signal and noise in concatenated erbium-doped fiber optical amplifiers","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3867539","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation of signal and noise in concatenated erbium-doped fiber optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00065871.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044065S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"194","articleId":"65871","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":65872,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The results are based on a novel method of evaluating the probability of error in the presence of the signal-spontaneous and spontaneous-spontaneous beat noise components. Laser chirping causes the dependence of the receiver sensitivity on the fiber dispersion coefficient*length product DL to be different for TWSOA/p-i-n and avalanche photodiode (APD) receivers.

Coupled formulations, where for instance voltages and VAr become constraints on MW scheduling, are handled. Former limitations on the modeling of generator cost curves have been eliminated. In addition, the approach accommodates a large variety of power system operating limits, including the very important category of contingency constraints.

The SFR model is a simplification of other models used for this purpose, but it is believed to include the essential system dynamics. The SFR model is based on neglecting nonlinearities and all but the largest time constants in the equations of the generating units of the power system, with the added assumption that the generation is dominated by reheat steam turbine generators. This means that the generating unit inertia and reheat time constants predominate over the system average frequency response. Moreover, since only two time constants predominate, the resulting system response can be computed in closed form, thereby providing a simple, but fairly accurate, method of estimating the essential characteristics of the system frequency response.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-order system frequency response model","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.65898","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/2372/00065898.pdf","startPage":"720","endPage":"729","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00065898.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.65898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2372","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=65898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/65898/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1990","displayDocTitle":"A low-order system frequency response model","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3770648","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-order system frequency response model","sourcePdf":"00065898.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044668S","chronDate":"Aug.  1990","isNumber":"2372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"366","articleId":"65898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":65900,"authors":[{"name":"Shi-Chung Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shi-Chung Chang","id":"37087148513"},{"name":"Chun-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun-Hung Chen","id":"37087167626"},{"name":"I-Kong Fong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"I-Kong Fong","id":"37087165132"},{"name":"P.B.

Then the bad measurement is identified and eliminated by estimating the measurement errors of the zero residual measurements. The residuals obtained from this second estimation step are made use of for this purpose. In order to minimize the computational burden during the elimination cycles, a fast way of eliminating measurements through weight changing is also presented.

It is shown that the amplitude-only-based method is a feasible alternative to the full complex spectrum method when the minimum in-phase transfer function of the system is needed or when there is some a priori knowledge about the nonminimal in-phase character of the system. It appears that transfer function estimation of linear systems using amplitude information only is possible if care is taken to circumvent the degeneration problems of the information matrix. The performance of the amplitude-only estimation is compared with the performance of a full complex estimation, both analytically and through simulation. The amplitude-only estimation appears to yield a larger standard deviation on the transfer function parameters. Optimal excitation for both cases seems to be quite different. The complex estimation shows good results when only passband information is provided. In this case the amplitude-only estimation is shown to be worthless. However, extending the measurements in the transition band of the system implies a large lowering of the parameter uncertainty and allows the use of this method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.1990.65948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.1990.65948","startPage":"8","endPage":"13","displayPublicationTitle":"7th IEEE Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement Technology","pdfPath":"/iel2/105/2373/00065948.pdf","publicationTitle":"7th IEEE Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude-only versus amplitude-phase estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Feb 1990","displayDocTitle":"Amplitude-only versus amplitude-phase estimation","conferenceDate":"13-15 Feb. 1990","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3719720","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/65948/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude-only versus amplitude-phase estimation","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00065948.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031822S","chronDate":"13-15 Feb 1990","isNumber":"2373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"105","articleId":"65948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":65986,"authors":[{"name":"Y.C.

A sine wave with frequency f/sub 0/ is used as an input test signal to a B-bit A/D system. Spectral averaging is then performed on many asynchronously acquired data records with length N. The jitter standard deviation can then be calculated from the measured signal-to-noise floor ratio.

There are three dominating charge loss mechanisms, which manifest themselves in three distinct phases in time evolution characteristics. The first phase is an initial fast threshold voltage shift which increases with nitride thickness and results from an intrinsic nitride property. The second phase is caused by electrons moving within the nitride. This electron transport follows a linear ohmic-like conduction. The third phase is a long-term charge loss due to electrons leaking through the top oxide. It can be minimized with a thick top oxide. Based on the above observations, a model to describe the intrinsic EPROM charge loss mechanisms is proposed. This model has been useful in developing a novel scaling methodology for an EPROM interpoly ONO films to improve charge retention capability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/66077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 March 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3809763","conferenceDate":"27-29 March 1990","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A model for EPROM intrinsic charge loss through oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) interpoly dielectric","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model for EPROM intrinsic charge loss through oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) interpoly dielectric","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00066077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036486S","chronDate":"27-29 March 1990","isNumber":"2374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"108","citationCount":"22","articleId":"66077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":66078,"authors":[{"name":"R.

During the stress, an increase of the access times, the minimum operating voltage, and the write times is observed. The latter two can be directly related, even quantitatively, to the degradation of the access transistor of the memory cell. Comparison of product and transistor lifetimes show that their voltage dependence is the same, but that the product lifetime is significantly (about a factor 50) larger. The discrepancy is caused by the small sensitivity of the SRAM to transistor degradation, and by duty cycle effects It is concluded that the product lifetime is severely underestimated if it is straightforwardly derived from static transistor lifetime data only.

The improvement results from the use of a uniform write and erase technology.

It is also shown that a uniform write and uniform erase technology using Fowler-Nordheim tunneling current guarantees a wide cell threshold voltage window even after 10/sup 6/ write and erase cycles.

The controllable design factors include the device component values, device physical variables, and fabrication parameters such as deposition time, rate, and doses. The uncontrollable factors are environmental condition variations such as temperature and humidity, as well as fabrication inaccuracies in alignment and diffusion. The method consists of sample, relate, and optimize (SR) stages. At the sample stage, a set of confined random design points are chosen from an initial design space. At the relate stage, the relationship between these points and their responses are used to train an artificial neural network (NN) based on a backpropagation model. At the optimize stage, acceptable inputs can be predicted and therefore the manufacturing yield increased by using this NN computational scheme.

This allows a substantial improvement in the closed-loop characteristics. Several techniques are employed to predict this result.

By providing an effective feedforward of the load current, this technique ensures excellent load transient response and low output impedance. There are several advantages to this technique. Measurement of the control-to-output transfer function cannot be easily performed. Also, the positive zero elimination is dependent on the capacitor ESR value. This technique can be susceptible to noise since the output voltage switching ripple is not filtered in the compensation network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1990.66413","publicationTitle":"Fifth Annual Proceedings on Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth Annual Proceedings on Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel2/135/2380/00066413.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1990.66413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2380","startPage":"205","endPage":"211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elimination of the positive zero in fixed frequency boost and flyback converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=66413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Elimination of the positive zero in fixed frequency boost and flyback converters","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 March 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/66413/","conferenceDate":"11-16 March 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3788105","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elimination of the positive zero in fixed frequency boost and flyback converters","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00066413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044179S","chronDate":"11-16 March 1990","isNumber":"2380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"135","citationCount":"33","articleId":"66413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":66420,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The complexity of SPUDT filter design results from the fact that a SPUDT deliberately includes reflections internal to the transducer to cancel the effects of regeneration reflection. This destroys the validity of the impulse-response model which is the basis for all conventional SAW (surface acoustic wave) transducer designs. Although a recent generalization of the impulse response model includes effects of uniform internal reflections, it is of limited usefulness, because a high-performance SPUDT filter requires both weighted reflection and weighted transduction. Presented is a six-step SPUDT synthesis procedure which includes a new method for determining transduction and reflection weighting functions that satisfy a desired amplitude and phase response, achieve low insertion loss, achieve low triple transit, allow use of simple matching networks, and properly account for the interactions between transduction and reflection effects under matched conditions. Fundamental insertion-loss limitations for SPUDT filters are discussed and areas for future SPUDT research are outlined. Good experimental performance is demonstrated for a bandpass filter that uses a new SPUDT structure, the EWC/SPUDT, the geometry of which is also shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1989.66963","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium,","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium,","pdfPath":"/iel2/857/2385/00066963.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"89 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.1989.66963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overview of design challenges for single phase unidirectional SAW filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=66963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/66963/","displayDocTitle":"Overview of design challenges for single phase unidirectional SAW filters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3774478","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview of design challenges for single phase unidirectional SAW filters","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00066963.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023473S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct 1989","isNumber":"2385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"857","citationCount":"121","articleId":"66963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":66967,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In order to obtain good focusing properties, the concept of optical phase-conjugate mirrors, valid for monochromatic signals, is extended to large-bandwidth pulses such as those used in ultrasound echography. The transducer's linear response to the acoustic pressure allows replacement of the phase conjugation by a time-reversal operation on the pulse echo signals. The time-reversal mirror is an array of transmit-receive transducers. A first incident wave is reflected by the target. The received signals are stored in shift registers, reversed in times and then reemitted. The major advantage of this process is that the waves distorted by the aberrating medium are corrected by the mirror operation and the back propagation through the medium. When the medium contains several reflectors, this time-reversal process can be iterated in order to focus on the most-reflective one.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1989.67072","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium,","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium,","pdfPath":"/iel2/857/2385/00067072.pdf","startPage":"681","endPage":"686 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.1989.67072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self focusing in inhomogeneous media with time reversal acoustic mirrors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"Self focusing in inhomogeneous media with time reversal acoustic mirrors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3774508","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self focusing in inhomogeneous media with time reversal acoustic mirrors","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00067072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047089S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct 1989","isNumber":"2385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"857","citationCount":"197","articleId":"67072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":67088,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

The rod composite geometry provides materials with enhanced electromechanical coupling and with acoustic impedance close to that of tissue; these factors yield transducers for medical ultrasonic imaging with high sensitivity and compact impulse response. The dice-and-fill technique produces piezocomposites that can be readily formed into complex shapes to facilitate focusing the ultrasonic beam. Proper design of the rod spacing yields materials that exhibit low crosstalk between array elements formed by patterning the electrode alone, without cutting between the elements. In this way, curved annular arrays have been made that provide high-quality clinical images of substantial diagnostic value to physicians.

During the year the Cold War all but concluded, raising the prospect of cuts in military budgets and motivating defense contractors to look for commercial ventures. Arms-control pacts notwithstanding, turmoil in the Persian Gulf dominated the military realm in 1990. Two technology developments of the 1980s-night-combat capabilities and better control of electromagnetic signatures-may be critical to Gulf combat. Another ongoing trend, distancing humans from battle to reduce casualties, is expected to result in one of the few significant growth areas in the 1990s: unmanned vehicles. Space, also a robust area, saw the debut of an inexpensive launch vehicle called pegasus, sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In civilian aerospace, the Hubble Space Telescope debacle cast a long shadow, although some bright stellar images proved salvageable by computer reconstruction. Officials at NASA hope the next one of their four orbiting observatories, the US $550 million Gamma Ray Observatory, will be lofted without glitches in the first half of 1991. Commercial space ventures took off and are changing the landscape for launching. Japan and Europe achieved notable successes with some spacecraft.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/6.67247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/6.67247","endPage":"75","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel3/6/2388/00067247.pdf","startPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Technology 1991: aerospace/military","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67247/","displayDocTitle":"Technology 1991: aerospace/military","volume":"28","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3891367","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Technology 1991: aerospace/military","sourcePdf":"00067247.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048381S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","articleId":"67247","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":67289,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In this two-part work, a common algebraic framework is introduced for the frozen-time analysis of stability and H/sup infinity / optimization in slowly time-varying systems, based on the notion of a normed algebra on which local and global products are defined. Relations between local stability, local (near) optimality, local coprime factorization, and global versions of these properties are sought. The framework is valid for time-domain disturbances in l/sup infinity /. H/sup infinity / behavior is related to l/sup infinity / input-output behavior via the device of an approximate isometry between frequency and time-domain norms. The authors presently elaborate on the double-algebra concept for Volterra operators which approximately commute with the shift, and summarize the main algebraic properties and norm inequalities. Local conditions for global invertibility are also obtained. Classical frozen-time stability conditions are incorporated in relations between local and global spectra.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local-global double algebras for slow H/sup infinity / adaptation.

Two distinct situations for the initial condition of the system are considered; the initial condition is assumed known in one case, while in the other the initial condition is not known but the initial condition, the plant, and measurement noise are in some weighted ball of R/sup n/XL/sub 2/. Finite-horizon and infinite-horizon cases are considered. Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for the existence of estimators (both filters and smoothers) that achieve a prescribed performance bound, and algorithms that result in performance within the bounds are developed. In case of smoothers, the optimal smoother is also presented. The approach uses basic quadratic optimization theory in a time-domain setting, as a consequence of which both linear time-varying and time-invariant systems can be considered with equal ease.

The control objective is to identify and compensate for a nonlinear disturbance function. The nonlinear disturbance function is represented as an integral of a predefined kernel function multiplied by an unknown influence function. Sufficient conditions for the existence of such a representation are provided. Similarly, the nonlinear function estimate is generated by an integral of the predefined kernel multiplied by an influence function estimate. Using the time history of the plant, the learning rule indirectly estimates the unknown function by updating the influence function estimate. It is shown that the estimate function converges to the actual disturbance asymptotically. Consequently, the controller achieves the disturbance cancellation asymptotically. The method is extended to repetitive control applications. It is applied to the control of robot manipulators. Simulation and actual real-time implementation results using the Berkeley/NSK robot arm show that the proposed learning algorithm is more robust and converges at a faster rate than conventional repetitive controllers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.67294","startPage":"188","endPage":"197","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/2391/00067294.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.67294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new adaptive learning rule","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robotics and automation","Manufacturing automation","Error correction","Kernel","Robot control","Manipulators","Adaptive control","Mechanical engineering","Control systems","Motion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","identification","learning systems","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive learning rule","nonlinear function identification","learning control","nonlinear disturbance function","kernel function","influence function","time history","disturbance cancellation","repetitive control applications","robot manipulators","Berkeley/NSK robot arm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67294/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"A new adaptive learning rule","volume":"36","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3879999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new adaptive learning rule","sourcePdf":"00067294.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030214S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"213","articleId":"67294","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":67296,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Research in the area of expanding the allowed ranges of the input variables for which accurate output values can be obtained is presented. The methods proposed to expand the range of convergence for the CORDIC algorithm do not necessitate any unwidely overhead calculation, thus making this work amenable to a hardware implementation. The number of extra iterations introduced in the modified CORDIC algorithms is significantly less than the number of extra iterations discussed elsewhere. This reduction in the number of extra iterations will lead to a faster hardware implementation.

A sensitivity study using a simple analytical queueing model shows that a reduction in these two components (both of which are related to the rotation of disk drives) has the greatest impact in reducing the disk's basic service time and in turn produces the greatest improvement in overall subsystem performance. While the most straightforward way to reduce latency and RPS miss penalty would be to increase the disk's rotation speed, there are some limitations to such an approach. Several alternatives to reducing latency and RPS miss penalty are proposed and explored, and their performance is analyzed using analytical queuing models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.67317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/2392/00067317.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.67317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving disk performance via latency reduction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","displayDocTitle":"Improving disk performance via latency reduction","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3880049","volume":"40","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving disk performance via latency reduction","sourcePdf":"00067317.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060421S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"44","articleId":"67317","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":67330,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

The greatest potential for energy savings is found to exist for the case of loads with nonlinear torque-speed characteristics, such as a fan or pump load.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.67529","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/2395/00067529.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"37","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00067529.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.67529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Loss minimization control of an induction motor drive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=67529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67529/","displayDocTitle":"Loss minimization control of an induction motor drive","volume":"27","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3891632","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loss minimization control of an induction motor drive","sourcePdf":"00067529.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046552S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1991","isNumber":"2395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"99","articleId":"67529","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":67531,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In addition, these are also predicted by the conventional method and compared with the machine parameters obtained by the load tests. The inductance equations were used in the measurement of parameters of the test machines, and their validities were experimentally confirmed.

All three circuits operate in a soft-switched manner, making possible a reduction in device switching losses and an increase in switching frequency. The three-phase dual-bridge converter proposed is shown to have the most favorable characteristics. This converter consists of two three-phase inverter stages operating in a high-frequency six-step mode. In contrast to existing single-phase AC-link DC/DC converters, lower turn-off peak currents in the power devices and lower RMS current ratings for both the input and output filter capacitors are obtained. This is in addition to smaller filter element values due to the higher-frequency content of the input and output waveforms. Furthermore, the use of a three-phase symmetrical transformer instead of single-phase transformers and a better utilization of the available apparent power of the transformer (as a consequence of the controlled output inverter) significantly increase the power density attainable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.67533","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00067533.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.67533","startPage":"63","endPage":"73","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/2395/00067533.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A three-phase soft-switched high-power-density DC/DC converter for high-power applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67533/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"A three-phase soft-switched high-power-density DC/DC converter for high-power applications","volume":"27","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3891636","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A three-phase soft-switched high-power-density DC/DC converter for high-power applications","sourcePdf":"00067533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030991S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1991","isNumber":"2395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"1248","articleId":"67533","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":67536,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Therefore, a low-temperature joining technique based on the principle of diffusion welding has been developed. The surfaces to be joined have to be metalized with Ag or Au. The molybdenum substrate is coated with a thin layer of silver flakes. Thereafter, the parts to be joined are sintered together at about 240 degrees C and a pressure of approximately 40 N/mm/sup 2/ for a few minutes. The joining technique does not affect the silicon wafer, and accordingly, is compatible with conventional power device and IC fabrication techniques. Both sides of the wafer can be joined with substrates even if IC structures are present. This possibility allows an increased surge current. Numerical calculations for different wafer thicknesses have been performed and compared with test devices. The technical usefulness has been proved by additional tests such as thermal cycling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00067536.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/2395/00067536.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"95","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.67536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.67536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=67536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel large area joining technique for improved power device performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silver","Substrates","Thermal conductivity","Powders","Silicon","Welding","Alloying","Gold","Testing","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","joining processes","power electronics","power integrated circuits","semiconductor devices","semiconductor technology","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power device fabrication","elemental semiconductors","large area joining technique","power device performance","diffusion welding","IC fabrication techniques","surge current","wafer thicknesses","thermal cycling","240 degC","Ag","Au","Si-Ag-Mo","Mo"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67536/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Novel large area joining technique for improved power device performance","volume":"27","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3891639","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel large area joining technique for improved power device performance","sourcePdf":"00067536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037418S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1991","isNumber":"2395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"118","articleId":"67536","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":67578,"authors":[{"name":"K.-C.

The techniques are classified based on the surface representation used, implicit versus explicit functions. A study is made of the important aspects of the surface reconstruction techniques. One aspect is the viewpoint invariance of the methods. This is an important property if object recognition is the ultimate objective. The robustness of the various methods is examined. It is determined whether the parameter estimates are biased, and the sensitivity to obscuration is addressed. The latter two aspects are particularly important for fitting functions in the implicit form. A detailed description is given of a parametric reconstruction method for three-dimensional object surfaces that involves numeric grid generation techniques and variational principle formulations. This technique is invariant to rigid motion in dimensional space.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.67626","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/2400/00067626.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00067626.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.67626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On three-dimensional surface reconstruction methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67626/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","displayDocTitle":"On three-dimensional surface reconstruction methods","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3880511","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On three-dimensional surface reconstruction methods","sourcePdf":"00067626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060522S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"162","articleId":"67626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":67632,"authors":[{"name":"W.J.

In addition, an algorithm is developed for determining the number of statistically distinct regions in an image and estimating the parameters of those regions. Both algorithms use a causal Gaussian autoregressive model to describe the mean, variance, and spatial correlation of the image textures. Together, the algorithms can be used to perform unsupervised texture segmentation. The multiple resolution segmentation algorithm first segments images at coarse resolution and then progresses to finer resolutions until individual pixels are classified. This method results in accurate segmentations and requires significantly less computation than some previously known methods. The field containing the classification of each pixel in the image is modeled as a Markov random field. Segmentation at each resolution is then performed by maximizing the a posteriori probability of this field subject to the resolution constraint. At each resolution, the a posteriori probability is maximized by a deterministic greedy algorithm which iteratively chooses the classification of individual pixels or pixel blocks. The unsupervised parameter estimation algorithm determines both the number of textures and their parameters by minimizing a global criterion based on the AIC information criterion. Clusters corresponding to the individual textures are formed by alternately estimating the cluster parameters and repartitioning the data into those clusters. Concurrently, the number of distinct textures is estimated by combining clusters until a minimum of the criterion is reached.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00067641.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/2401/00067641.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.67641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.67641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2401","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=67641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple resolution segmentation of textured images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Image segmentation","Parameter estimation","Spatial resolution","Pixel","Image texture","Markov random fields","Greedy algorithms","Clustering algorithms","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","pattern recognition","picture processing","probability","statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","picture processing","parameter estimation","textured images","statistical behavior","causal Gaussian autoregressive model","mean","variance","spatial correlation","unsupervised texture segmentation","multiple resolution segmentation","coarse resolution","Markov random field","posteriori probability","deterministic greedy algorithm","classification","AIC information criterion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Multiple resolution segmentation of textured images","volume":"13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3880502","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple resolution segmentation of textured images","sourcePdf":"00067641.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039348S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"263","articleId":"67641","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":67642,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

Most 3-D object recognition systems construct models either manually or by training. Neither approach has been very satisfactory, particularly in designing object recognition systems which can handle a large number of objects. Recent interest in integrating mechanical CAD systems and vision systems has led to a third type of model building for vision: adaptation of preexisting CAD models of objects for recognition. If a solid model of an object to be recognized is already available in a manufacturing database, then it should be possible to infer automatically a model appropriate for vision tasks from the manufacturing model. Such a system has been developed. It uses 3-D object descriptions created on a commercial CAD system and expressed in both the industry-standard IGES form and a polyhedral approximation and performs geometric inferencing to obtain a relational graph representation of the object which can be stored in a database of models for object recognition. Relational graph models contain both view-independent information extracted from the IGES description and view-dependent information (patch areas) extracted from synthetic views of the object. It is argued that such a system is needed to efficiently create a large database (more than 100 objects) of 3-D models to evaluate matching strategies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67642/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1991","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3880503","volume":"13","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"CAD-based computer vision: from CAD models to relational graphs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAD-based computer vision: from CAD models to relational graphs","sourcePdf":"00067642.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078965S","chronDate":"Feb.  1991","isNumber":"2401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"99","articleId":"67642","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":67644,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Instead of stopping rules to halt partitioning, the approach of growing a large tree with pure terminal nodes and selectively pruning it back is used. A new efficient iterative method is proposed to grow and prune classification trees. This method divides the data sample into two subsets and iteratively grows a tree with one subset and prunes it with the other subset, successively interchanging the roles of the two subsets. The convergence and other properties of the algorithm are established. Theoretical and practical considerations suggest that the iterative free growing and pruning algorithm should perform better and require less computation than other widely used tree growing and pruning algorithms.

The training texture images (parent classes) are modeled by Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs). To classify a rotated and scaled test texture, the rotation and scale changes are incorporated in the texture model through an appropriate transformation of the power spectral density of the GMRF. For the rotated and scaled image, a bona fide likelihood function that shows the explicit dependence of the likelihood function on the GMRF parameters, as well as on the rotation and scale parameters, is derived. Although, in general, the scaled and/or rotated texture does not correspond to a finite-order GMRF, it is possible nonetheless to write down a likelihood function for the image data. The likelihood function of the discrete Fourier transform of the image data corresponds to that of a white nonstationary Gaussian random field, with the variance at each pixel (i,j) being a known function of the rotation, the scale, the GMRF model parameters, and (i,j). The variance is an explicit function of the appropriately sampled power spectral density of the GMRF. The estimation of the rotation and scale parameters is performed in the frequency domain by maximizing the likelihood function associated with the discrete Fourier transform of the image data. Cramer-Rao error bounds on the scale and rotation estimates are easily computed. A modified Bayes decision rule is used to classify a given test image into one of C possible texture classes. The classification power of the method is demonstrated through experimental results on natural textures from the Brodatz album.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.67648","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","startPage":"192","endPage":"202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/2401/00067648.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00067648.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.67648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of rotated and scaled textured images using Gaussian Markov random field models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov random fields","Testing","Stochastic processes","Discrete Fourier transforms","Pixel","Frequency estimation","Frequency domain analysis","Object recognition","Inspection","Fixtures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","decision theory","parameter estimation","pattern recognition","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","parameter estimation","rotated textured images","scaled textured images","Gaussian Markov random field models","parent texture classes","training texture images","likelihood function","discrete Fourier transform","white nonstationary Gaussian random field","power spectral density","Cramer-Rao error bounds","modified Bayes decision rule","classification power","Brodatz album"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Classification of rotated and scaled textured images using Gaussian Markov random field models","volume":"13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3880509","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67648/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of rotated and scaled textured images using Gaussian Markov random field models","sourcePdf":"00067648.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039319S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"214","articleId":"67648","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":67672,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A nonlinear dynamic model is developed and decomposed into separate slow and fast subsystems. A feedback control is designed so that, whenever the fast subsystem is at equilibrium, the dynamics of the slow subsystem are input-output equivalent to a second-order transfer function. The use of reduced-order feedback linearization methods leads to improved performance by reducing torque ripple. Experimental results from a laboratory implementation of a position control system are presented. On the basis of measured overshoot, risetime, and settling time, the prototype response is consistent with the desired linear response to within 23% error on average. The transient behavior of the motor can thus be adjusted over a wide range, and in a reasonably predictable fashion, by simply varying the gains of the outermost loop.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67673/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3889108","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An experimental study on composite control of switched reluctance motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental study on composite control of switched reluctance motors","sourcePdf":"00067673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054721S","chronDate":"Feb.  1991","isNumber":"2403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"58","articleId":"67673","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":67702,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is composed of alternating and interacting global optimization and partitioning steps that are followed by an optimization of the area utilization. Methods using the divide-and-conquer paradigm usually lose the global view by generating smaller and smaller subproblems. In contrast, GORDIAN maintains the simultaneous treatment of all cells over all global optimization steps, thereby considering constraints that reflect the current dissection of the circuit. The global optimizations are performed by solving quadratic programming problems that possess unique global minima. Improved partitioning schemes for the stepwise refinement of the placement are introduced. The area utilization is optimized by an exhaustive slicing procedure. The placement method is applied to real-world problems, and excellent results in terms of placement quality and computation time are obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.67789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/2407/00067789.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.67789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GORDIAN: VLSI placement by quadratic programming and slicing optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67789/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"GORDIAN: VLSI placement by quadratic programming and slicing optimization","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3889442","volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GORDIAN: VLSI placement by quadratic programming and slicing optimization","sourcePdf":"00067789.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040778S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"286","articleId":"67789","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":67793,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

In one such approach, the probability of generating a fault in a given subarea of an integrated circuit at any given time is assumed to depend on the number of faults already in that area and on the number of faults in the nearest-neighbor adjacent subareas. Although such procedures had been used heuristically, technical considerations show that this stochastic approach actually is analytically justifiable. It is found that the resulting distribution functions, the joint probability distribution function, the distribution function of the sum of dependent random variables, and the correlation between these variables are identical to results obtained with a large-area cluster model using compound Poisson statistics. This offers a unique insight into a statistical isomorphism that has been a puzzling issue.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistics associated with spatial fault simulation used for evaluating integrated circuit yield enhancement","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.67793","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/2407/00067793.pdf","startPage":"399","endPage":"406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.67793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2407","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=67793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67793/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"Statistics associated with spatial fault simulation used for evaluating integrated circuit yield enhancement","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3889446","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistics associated with spatial fault simulation used for evaluating integrated circuit yield enhancement","sourcePdf":"00067793.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035711S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"8","articleId":"67793","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":67829,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

A model for the received signal from blood scatterers, using a train of short wideband pulses, is described. Evaluation of the autocorrelation of the signal based on this model shows that the magnitude, periodicity, and phase of the autocorrelation are affected by the mean scatterer velocity and the presence of a velocity spread target. New velocity estimators are then derived that exploit the effect of the scatterer velocity on both the signal delay and the shift in frequency. The wideband range spread estimator is derived using a statistical model of the target. Based on the point target assumption, a simpler wideband maximum-likelihood estimator is also obtained. These new estimation strategies are analyzed for their local and global performance. Evaluation of the Cramer-Rao bound shows that the bound on the estimator variance is reduced using these estimators, in comparison with narrowband strategies. In order to study global accuracy, the expected estimator output is evaluated, and it is determined that the width of the mainlobe is reduced. In addition, it is shown that the height of subsidiary velocity peaks is reduced through the use of these new estimators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.67829","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/2409/00067829.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.67829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new wideband spread target maximum likelihood estimator for blood velocity estimation.

The signal models and performance of the estimation strategies described in pt.I are tested with experimental ultrasonic data. The ultrasonic data analyzed verify the theoretical model and predicted performance. The averaged correlation, verified experimentally, confirms that the correlation envelope can be used to estimate the velocity of scatterers and that the shape of the correlation function conveys information regarding the velocity profile within the sample volume. For both the wideband point and range spread estimators, the predicted improvement in velocity resolution and the reduction in height of subsidiary velocity peaks are demonstrated. Through the use of these estimation strategies, information regarding the mean velocity and velocity variation are available for each spatial location within the vessel. This information is presented using a three-dimensional spatial velocity profile display, which appears to offer a number of advantages in the rapid identification of pathology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new wideband spread target maximum likelihood estimator for blood velocity estimation.

A theoretical and experimental analysis of the validity of this approach is reported for a 45-MHz PVDF transducer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.67834","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/2409/00067834.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.67834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2409","startPage":"48","endPage":"55","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The design of protection circuitry for high-frequency ultrasound imaging systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=67834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The design of protection circuitry for high-frequency ultrasound imaging systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67834/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3893571","pubMedId":"18267556","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The design of protection circuitry for high-frequency ultrasound imaging systems","sourcePdf":"00067834.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035552S","chronDate":"Jan.  1991","isNumber":"2409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"61","articleId":"67834","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":67843,"authors":[{"name":"H.-C.

Methods for restoring moving targets to their correct size and position are described. The samples collected for SAR processing are frequency-modulated RF pulses. Mathematically this leads to spectra that are described by Fresnel integrals. For stationary targets, the spectrum is symmetrical around the origin. If there is a moving target in a range cell, its Doppler spectrum will be displaced from the origin and may undergo other changes as a result of its nonzero velocity. Proper compensation to locate the target at the correct position requires that the spectrum be translated to a position dependent on the along-track velocity rather than to the origin. From the central frequency, the along-range velocity component can be estimated and the length of the translation can then be found. After translation, the spectrum is converted back to the time domain and the customary SAR processing is performed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Target motion compensation in synthetic aperture radar","publicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","doi":"10.1109/62.67843","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel3/62/2410/00067843.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"18","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00067843.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/62.67843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2410","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=67843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67843/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Target motion compensation in synthetic aperture radar","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3893366","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target motion compensation in synthetic aperture radar","sourcePdf":"00067843.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033832S","chronDate":"Feb.  1991","isNumber":"2410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"62","articleId":"67843","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":67861,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

An architecture that is an alternative to the existing layered architectures is proposed. The novel feature of the proposed architecture is the reduction in the vertical layering; services that correspond to the definitions of layers four to six in the Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model are combined into a single, horizontally structured layer. This approach lends itself more naturally to parallel implementation. Moreover, the delay of a set of processes implemented in parallel is determined by the delay of the longest process, not by the sum of all the process delays, as is the case in a sequential implementation. In the same way, the total throughput need not be limited by the lowest-capacity process, but can be increased by concurrently performing the function on several devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","B-ISDN","Processor scheduling","Delay","Throughput","Context","Communication switching","Hardware","Very large scale integration","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","ISDN","open systems","parallel architectures","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vertical layering reduction","OSI","network interfaces","broadband ISDN","communications protocols","Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model","horizontally structured layer","parallel implementation","process delays"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=67861","doi":"10.1109/65.67861","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel3/65/2411/00067861.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/65.67861","startPage":"64","endPage":"70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2411","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A protocol structure for high-speed communication over broadband ISDN","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A protocol structure for high-speed communication over broadband ISDN","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/67861/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1991","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3882313","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A protocol structure for high-speed communication over broadband ISDN","sourcePdf":"00067861.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054102S","chronDate":"Jan.  1991","isNumber":"2411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"46","articleId":"67861","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":67883,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Arrayed stripe junctions are fabricated instead of bitlines and the charge collected by each stripe junction when irradiated by alpha -particles is measured. The collection mechanism is clarified and the scaling of collected charges in downscaled DRAMs is estimated, by analyzing the profile of the charge shared by each junction. In the case of folded bitline, charges collected by adjacent bitlines canceled each other because the junctions not hit by alpha -particles also collected charge by diffusion. However, when the junction width is less than 0.6 mu m, the charge collected by diffusion becomes negligible due to the potential barrier caused by channel-cut impurities.

Other possible ways to reduce distortion are to use lasers with reduced chirp, presumably with a multiquantum-well laser structure, or lasers with well-controlled spatial hole burning.

Six of these channels are generated by individual digitally tuned optical frequency synthesizers. The frequency of these six channels can be randomly selected from a set of equispaced frequencies (2.2 GHz). Two of the 16 multichannel signals coming out of the star coupler are demultiplexed by their individual digitally tuned heterodyne receivers. Each receiver can randomly select, from the computer keyboard, a desired channel. The computer can identify missing channels. More importantly, the digital tuning of the frequency synthesizers and of the receivers is insensitive to variations of the frequency-tuning current relationship of the lasers.

The programs use a disassembly analysis for generating sequences and provide online visual aids during generation and evaluation. During evaluation, matters such as avoiding difficult assembly states or moves, stability, fixturing, orientation, refixturing and reorientation count, and inclusion of favorable states are considered to highlight desirable or undesirable sequences. The designer edits the set of sequences according to these criteria, leading to an informed sequence choice or to needed design refinement.

The external disturbances, sensor noises, parameter uncertainties, and the dynamics of the total system composed of the robot and the environment have been modeled. The control of the manipulator is divided into two components: a computed torque trajectory controller that regulates the robot position and a compliance controller that modulates contact forces. Three sufficient conditions for stability have been derived. The first condition guarantees the stability of the system of robot and finite stiff environment when no force sensor and, consequently, no force feedback is considered for the system. The second condition guarantees stability of the robot and environment when a compliance compensator (operating on the contact force) supplements the trajectory controller. The third stability criterion shows that, for a robot contacting a very stiff environment, the gain of the compliance compensator must vary in inverse proportion to the gain of the trajectory compensator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.68073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.68073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2415/00068073.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory and experiments on the stability of robot compliance control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Theory and experiments on the stability of robot compliance control","volume":"7","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3883248","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory and experiments on the stability of robot compliance control","sourcePdf":"00068073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046817S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"50","articleId":"68073","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":68074,"authors":[{"name":"K.G.

The author considers a communication subsystem that is designed to support real-time control and coordination of devices in each CIM cell. The concept of a poll number is proposed to control the access to the intracell bus. The bus access mechanism with the poll number is intended to minimize the probability of real-time messages missing their deadlines. Use of a poll number provides not only for decentralized control of the intracell bus, but also a high degree of flexibility in scheduling messages. The performance of the bus access mechanism with a poll number is analyzed and compared with that of a token bus which is widely used in CIM systems such as MAP (Manufacturing Automation Protocol) networks. The probability of a real-time message missing its deadline in a token bus is found to be much higher than that of the proposed mechanism.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.68074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2415","startPage":"105","endPage":"113","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2415/00068074.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.68074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time communications in a computer-controlled workcell","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer integrated manufacturing","Communication system control","Robot sensing systems","Robot kinematics","Sensor systems","Distributed control","Job shop scheduling","Performance analysis","Manufacturing automation","Access protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication systems","decentralised control","local area networks","manufacturing computer control","real-time systems","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message scheduling","LAN","computer-controlled workcell","computer-integrated manufacturing","CIM","communication subsystem","real-time control","poll number","intracell bus","bus access mechanism","decentralized control","MAP","Manufacturing Automation Protocol"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Real-time communications in a computer-controlled workcell","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68074/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3883249","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time communications in a computer-controlled workcell","sourcePdf":"00068074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047957S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"40","articleId":"68074","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":68075,"authors":[{"name":"T.-J.

The manipulator dynamics and the motor dynamics are coupled to obtain a third-order-dynamic model, and differential geometry control theory is applied to produce a linearized and decoupled robot controller. The derived robot controller operates in the robot task space, thus eliminating the need for decomposition of motion commands into robot joint space commands. Computer simulations are performed to verify the feasibility of the proposed robot controller. The controller is further experimentally evaluated on the PUMA 560 robot arm. The experiments show that the proposed controller produces good trajectory tracking performances and is robust in the presence of model inaccuracies. Compared with a nonlinear feedback robot controller based on the manipulator dynamics only, the proposed robot controller yields conspicuously improved performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2415/00068075.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"122","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/70.68075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.68075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2415","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=68075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of motor dynamics on nonlinear feedback robot arm control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Robot control","Orbital robotics","Manipulator dynamics","Couplings","Solid modeling","Computational geometry","Control theory","Motion control","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamics","feedback","nonlinear control systems","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motor dynamics","nonlinear feedback","robot arm control","manipulator dynamics","differential geometry control theory","motion commands","joint space commands","PUMA 560","trajectory tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Effect of motor dynamics on nonlinear feedback robot arm control","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3883250","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of motor dynamics on nonlinear feedback robot arm control","sourcePdf":"00068075.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053508S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"240","articleId":"68075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":68082,"authors":[{"name":"K.-M.

The ball-joint-like motor has no singularities except at the boundary of the workspace and can perform isotropic manipulation in all three directions. Due to its relatively simple ball-like structure, undesired cross-coupling and centrifugal components of wrist rotor dynamics can be effectively minimized or eliminated. The spherical stepper motor has potential in robotic applications as a three-DOF shoulder or an eyeball, as well as a wrist actuator. In particular, the systematic conceptualization of a spherical stepper is presented, and the feasibility of constructing the spherical stepper is examined. Along with the experimental data, an analytical approach based on the permeance formula was used to predict the driving forces generated by a neodymium-iron permanent magnet.

The topology is suited for structures with a small number of processing elements (i.e. 32-128) whose area cannot be neglected compared to the area required for interconnection. The processing elements are implemented in pairs that are connected to form a ring. In this way three-quarters of the interconnections are between neighbors. The ring structure is laid out in two columns and the interconnection of nonneighbors is routed in the channel between the columns. The topology has been used in a VLSI implementation of the add-compare-select (ACS) module of a fully parallel K=7, R=1/2 Viterbi decoder. Both the floor-planning issues and some of the important algorithm and circuit-level aspects of this design are discussed. The chip has been designed and fabricated in a 2- mu m CMOS process using MOSIS-like simplified design rules. The chip operates at speeds up to 19 MHz under worst-case conditions (V/sub DD/=4.75 V and T/sub A/=70 degrees C). The core of the chip (excluding pad cells) is 7.8*5.1 mm/sup 2/ and contains approximately 50000 transistors.

The area model considers the supplied bandwidth of a memory cell and includes such buffer overhead as control logic, driver logic and tag storage. The model gave less than 10% error when verified against real caches and register files. It is shown that, comparing caches and register files in terms of area for the same storage capacity, caches generally occupy more area per bit than register files for small caches because the overhead dominates the cache area at these sizes. For larger caches, the smaller storage cells in the cache provide a smaller total cache area per bit than the register set. Studying cache performance (traffic ratio) as a function of area, it is shown that, for small caches (less than the area occupied by 256 registers bits-r.b.e.-or 32 b), direct-mapped caches perform significantly better than four-way set-associative caches and, for caches of medium areas (between 256 r.b.e. and 4096 r.b.e.), both direct-mapped and set-associative caches perform better than fully associative caches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.68123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2417","startPage":"98","endPage":"106","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2417/00068123.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An area model for on-chip memories and its application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68123/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An area model for on-chip memories and its application","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3891122","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An area model for on-chip memories and its application","sourcePdf":"00068123.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07376S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"129","articleId":"68123","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":68126,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Closed-form delay formulas are obtained for CMOS inverters and series-connected MOSFET structures (SCMSs) that include short-channel effects. It is shown that the ratio of the delay of NAND/NOR to the delay of the inverter becomes smaller in the submicrometer region, because the V/sub DS/ and V/sub GS/ of each MOSFET in the SCMS are smaller than those of an inverter MOSFET. The smaller voltages in turn mitigate and relax the severe carrier velocity saturation in miniaturized MOSFETs. The results of the analysis for submicrometer VLSI designs show that if the maximum number of series-connected MOSFETs is considered to be five in 2- mu m designs, then the number can be increased to six or seven in the submicrometer circuit design. In typical cases in VLSI designs, the delay ratio for N-SCMS is much less than N/sup 2/. The delay dependence on input terminal position for SCMS structures is also described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.68126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.68126","endPage":"131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2417/00068126.pdf","startPage":"122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay analysis of series-connected MOSFET circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68126/","displayDocTitle":"Delay analysis of series-connected MOSFET circuits","volume":"26","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3891125","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay analysis of series-connected MOSFET circuits","sourcePdf":"00068126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038688S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"189","articleId":"68126","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":68127,"authors":[{"name":"L.M.

This instrument, which uses monoenergetic collimated ions from a 3-MV tandem accelerator, can produce an ion beam with a diameter as small as 1 mu m. The precise alignment capability of the system allows positioning of the beam to any location in the circuit with an accuracy of better than 1 mu m. The monoenergetic beam with the device under vacuum simplifies the analysis of the experimental results. The results show that alpha-particle hits on sensitive nodes within the sense amplifiers dominate the SEU rate. This domination is due to the presence in the sense amplifiers of n-channel devices which can collect charge from the entire ion track. In contrast, the memory cells and bit lines contain only p/sup +/ nodes in an n-well, which shields them from charge generated in the substrate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.68127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.68127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2417/00068127.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ion microbeam probing of sense amplifiers to analyze single event upsets in a CMOS DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Ion microbeam probing of sense amplifiers to analyze single event upsets in a CMOS DRAM","volume":"26","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3891126","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ion microbeam probing of sense amplifiers to analyze single event upsets in a CMOS DRAM","sourcePdf":"00068127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048879S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"17","articleId":"68127","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":68130,"authors":[{"name":"T.-H.

The comparison shows that the conventional BiCMOS and the complementary BiCMOS buffers are efficient for power supply voltages greater than 3V and that if the power supply voltage is scaled down (<3 V) and the load capacitance is large (>1 pF), the complementary BiCMOS buffers would be the most suitable choice.

While the autoambiguity properties are found to be very similar to those of Costa codes, i.e. nearly ideal, the cross-ambiguity properties of quadratic congruential codes are much better. These results are valid across the whole class of code sets considered, but they are obtained at some expense in the pulse compression characteristics of the codes. A uniform upper bound is placed on the entire cross-ambiguity function surface, and bounds are placed on the amplitude of spurious peaks in the autoambiguity function. These bounds depend on the time-bandwidth product and code length exclusively and lead naturally to a discussion of the design tradeoffs for these two parameters. Examples of typical autoambiguity and cross-ambiguity functions are given to illustrate the performance of quadratic congruential coding with respect to Costas coding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ambiguity properties of quadratic congruential coding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/7.68144","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/2418/00068144.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.68144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2418","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=68144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68144/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","displayDocTitle":"Ambiguity properties of quadratic congruential coding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3891346","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ambiguity properties of quadratic congruential coding","sourcePdf":"68144.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027118S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"28","articleId":"68144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":68145,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

The collection of all possible hits, together with their locations, is recorded in time-frequency space, which produces the high array associated with the two patterns considered. If the code length is sufficiently small with respect to the time-bandwidth product chosen, the hit array can be viewed as a digital representation of the corresponding ambiguity function. Salient properties of the hit array formalism are derived, including simple relationships between hit arrays resulting from basic symmetry-preserving transformations.

A MUSIC (multiple signal classification) algorithm preprocessed by spatial smoothing is used. The spatial smoothing preprocessing is performed to destroy signal coherence, and the decorrelation performance is examined in detail. The expression which gives an individual response is given. Using this expression, it is possible to eliminate unwanted signals that appear as ripples in the frequency domain. Experimental results show that the frequency bandwidth required by the MUSIC algorithm to resolve distinct time-domain responses and eliminate unwanted signals is much narrower than that required by the FFT (fast Fourier transform). Thus, the MUSIC algorithm is applicable to the time-domain measurements with the network analyzer and has much higher resolution capability than the conventional FFT techniques.

The vector potential is a convolution of the free-space Green's function and some surface current density over the domain of interest. A weak form of this integral equation is obtained by testing it with subdomain basis functions defined over the plate domain only. As a next step, the vector potential is expanded in a sequence of subdomain basis functions and the grad-div operator is integrated analytically over the plate domain only. For the problem of electromagnetic scattering by a plate, the method shows excellent numerical performance.

The relevant sensory physiology of the skin, including the mechanisms of normal touch and the mechanisms and sensations associated with electrical stimulation of the skin using surface electrodes (electrotactile, or electrocutaneous, stimulation), is reviewed. The information-processing ability of the tactile sense and its relevance to sensory substitution is briefly summarized.

Uniformity is shown to depend on the metric properties of the two subconstellations resulting from the first step in set partitioning, as well as on the assignment of binary labels to channel symbols. The uniform distance property and uniform error property, which are both derived from uniformity but are not equivalent, are discussed. The derived concepts are extended to encompass transmission over a (not necessarily Gaussian) memoryless channel in which the metric used for detection may not be maximum likelihood. An appropriate distance measure is defined that generalizes the Euclidean distance. It is proved that uniformity of a TCM scheme can also be defined under this new distance.

The base station blankets the service region with a raster of very narrow pencil beams that can be rapidly scanned to any position in synchronism with the switching sequences of a time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) assignment. By deploying multiple scanning spot beams, the allocated spectrum can be reused many times. A centralized network controller, executing an efficient TDMA assignment algorithm, dynamically allocates the resources of a small transceiver pool among the far larger number of beam positions in response to real-time requests for service. By varying the dwell time at each beam position in response to the traffic intensity of the position, highly efficient resource utilization is provided. The high antenna gain of the base station antenna provides adequate arain fade margin to permit operation in the uncongested portion of the ratio spectrum above 20 GHz. The system is particularly well suited to emerging, direct-to-end-user wideband digital service offerings.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.68285","startPage":"141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2423/00068285.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.68285","endPage":"151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A metropolitan area radio system using scanning pencil beams","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68285/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","displayDocTitle":"A metropolitan area radio system using scanning pencil beams","volume":"39","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3891671","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A metropolitan area radio system using scanning pencil beams","sourcePdf":"00068285.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039179S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","articleId":"68285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":68286,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.M.

TDMA is provided for service flexibility and slow frequency hopping and coding for immunity against multipath fading and interference. Measurements show that, with a hallway-mounted distributed antenna system installed on one floor of the building and with the mobile unit transmitting only 1 mW of peak RF power from anywhere on that floor, only a single 384-b frame out of a total of 200000 transmitted frames suffered an unrecoverable error. This kind of performance is comparable to that of wired data modems. Similar performance was obtained from a central antenna covering the same floor. However, the required transmitted power in this case was 100 mW. Implementation issues, such as spectrum allocation, cellular subdivisions, and spectrum efficiency, are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2423/00068286.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"162","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.68286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.68286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=68286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An experimental TDMA indoor radio communications system using slow frequency hopping and coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time division multiple access","Indoor radio communication","Floors","Spread spectrum communication","Radio communication","Fading","Interference","Antenna measurements","Power measurement","Mobile antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","error correction codes","frequency agility","interference suppression","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF","burst-error correcting block code","Reed-Solomon code","interference immunity","multipath fading immunity","TDMA indoor radio communications system","slow frequency hopping","implementation","performance","coding","flexibility","hallway-mounted distributed antenna system","spectrum allocation","cellular subdivisions","spectrum efficiency","1.5 GHz","1 Mbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68286/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","displayDocTitle":"An experimental TDMA indoor radio communications system using slow frequency hopping and coding","volume":"39","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3891672","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental TDMA indoor radio communications system using slow frequency hopping and coding","sourcePdf":"00068286.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058614S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"26","articleId":"68286","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":68293,"authors":[{"name":"D.B.

A third-order, sigma-delta ( Sigma - Delta ) oversampled analog-to-digital (A/D) modulator network is presented. It shows improved performance in most respects over previous modulators. Although its theoretical performance in the absence of circuit nonidealities is below that of the triple first-order cascade network, when practical impairments such as finite amplifier gains and component mismatch are considered, it displays superior performance. Gain and offset errors are potentially lower for this network due to its ability to use a single capacitor for input signal and D/A feedback. A markedly reduced sensitivity to nonidealities for this network implies that monolithic circuits could be manufactured with better processing yields and hence lower unit costs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/2424/00068293.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.68293","doi":"10.1109/31.68293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of modulator networks for high-order oversampled Sigma Delta analog-to-digital converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of modulator networks for high-order oversampled Sigma Delta analog-to-digital converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68293/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3891699","volume":"38","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of modulator networks for high-order oversampled Sigma Delta analog-to-digital converters","sourcePdf":"00068293.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042292S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"91","articleId":"68293","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":68294,"authors":[{"name":"U.B.

A method based on a particular class of nonsymmetrical neural networks is proposed for eliminating the problem of stopping in spurious states. The dynamical behavior of these structures is studied to prove that they are characterized by a unique equilibrium point which is globally attractive-that is, the system will converge toward this point for every choice of initial conditions and for every choice of (continuous) nonlinearities. The explicit expression obtained for the unique equilibrium point permits one to design the connection strengths between neurons so that the equilibrium coincides with the desired output for a given input signal. The proposed design procedure is applied to the classical example of A/D conversion, showing that this A/D converter structure has no spurious states. The A/D was simulated using SPICE, and experimental results obtained with a discrete component prototype of the converter are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.68298","startPage":"202","endPage":"209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.68298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2424","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/2424/00068298.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On a class of nonsymmetrical neural networks with application to ADC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68298/","displayDocTitle":"On a class of nonsymmetrical neural networks with application to ADC","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3901991","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On a class of nonsymmetrical neural networks with application to ADC","sourcePdf":"00068298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050517S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"73","articleId":"68298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":68299,"authors":[{"name":"U.

By exploiting the event-driven nature of SPECS, the computation, storage, and interpolation of the Jacobians that specify the appropriate linearized circuit during the forward simulation is not required to obtain sensitivities. Both direct and adjoint methods require only a marginal computational overhead and provide equivalent results. The choice of the method to use depends on the ratio of the number of outputs to the number of parameters. More parameters favor the adjoint method and more outputs favor the direct. The overall efficiency of both SPECS and its time-domain sensitivity extension allows it to be applied to realistic circuits that, due to their large size, had previously made such analysis impractical. Simulation results on industrial circuits of up to 1500 MOS transistors show that transient sensitivities can be efficiently computed for large circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=68404","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit simulation","Computational modeling","Time domain analysis","Analytical models","Jacobian matrices","Circuit optimization","Circuit analysis computing","Interpolation","Computer industry","MOSFETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit analysis computing","sensitivity analysis","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct method","piecewise approximate circuit simulation","adjoint methods","time-domain transient sensitivities","SPECS","interpolation","Jacobians"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/2430/00068404.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.68404","doi":"10.1109/43.68404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity computation in piecewise approximate circuit simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68404/","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity computation in piecewise approximate circuit simulation","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3889424","volume":"10","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity computation in piecewise approximate circuit simulation","sourcePdf":"00068404.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082566S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"41","articleId":"68404","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":68448,"authors":[{"name":"R.

These indexes, which are functions of the variance of intervals and counts, are relatively straightforward and can estimate and convey much more information than simpler indexes (such as the coefficient of variation) that are often used to describe burstiness quantitatively. The author defines and evaluates the indexes of dispersion for some of the simple analytical models that are frequently used to represent highly variable processes. The indexes for a number of measured point processes that were generated by workstations communicating to file servers over a local area network are also estimated. It is shown that nonstationary components in the measured packet-arrival data distort the shape of the indexes, and ways to handle nonstationary data are proposed. To show how to incorporate measures of variability into analytical models and to offer an example of how to model the measured packet-arrival processes, the author describes a fitting procedure based on the index of dispersion for counts for the Markov-modulated Poisson process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.68448","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/2432/00068448.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.68448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2432","startPage":"203","endPage":"211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterizing the variability of arrival processes with indexes of dispersion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=68448","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterizing the variability of arrival processes with indexes of dispersion","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68448/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3890115","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterizing the variability of arrival processes with indexes of dispersion","sourcePdf":"00068448.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067877S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"144","articleId":"68448","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":68452,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Second and third-order autoregressive (AR) models are used to evaluate the spectral shift in grain signals by utilizing features such as resonating frequency, maximum energy frequency, or AR coefficients. Then, Euclidean distance, based on these features, is applied to classify grain scattering characteristics. Using both computer simulated data and experimental results, the probability of correct classification is found to be about 75% for the second-order AR model and 88% for the third-order AR model, when the conditions are such that the expected shift between the center frequency of echoes is less than 4%. This implies that, by increasing the order of the AR model, the frequency information extracted from the random signal is increased, which can result in obtaining a better classification.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68468/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3893578","pubMedId":"18267565","volume":"38","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of low-order autoregressive models for ultrasonic grain signal characterization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of low-order autoregressive models for ultrasonic grain signal characterization","sourcePdf":"00068468.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031014S","chronDate":"March  1991","isNumber":"2433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"43","articleId":"68468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":68469,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It is shown that an optimal rank can be obtained with a prior knowledge of flaw-to-clutter ratio and the underlying distributions. The order statistic filter performs well where the flaw and clutter echoes have good statistical separation in a given quantile region representing a particular rank (e.g. minimum, median, maximum). Order statistic filters are analyzed for the situation in which the observations do not contain equivalent statistical information. Experimental and simulated results are presented to show how effectively the order statistic filter can utilize information contained in different frequency bands to improve flaw detection.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/2433/00068470.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.68470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.68470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=68470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of order statistic filters applied to ultrasonic flaw detection using split-spectrum processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistical analysis","Radar scattering","Rayleigh scattering","Frequency diversity","Filtering","Ultrasonic imaging","Band pass filters","Radar detection","Signal processing","Statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic filters","acoustic signal processing","filtering and prediction theory","flaw detection","spectral analysis","statistical analysis","ultrasonic materials testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NDT","ultrasonic flaw detection","split-spectrum processing","broadband ultrasonic signals","order statistic filtering","flaw-to-clutter ratio","backscattered signals","optimal rank"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1991","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of order statistic filters applied to ultrasonic flaw detection using split-spectrum processing","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3893580","pubMedId":"18267567","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of order statistic filters applied to ultrasonic flaw detection using split-spectrum processing","sourcePdf":"00068470.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03247S","chronDate":"March  1991","isNumber":"2433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"49","articleId":"68470","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":68471,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

This microscope is capable of measuring both the amplitude and phase of the reflected and transmitted signals, in contrast with most earlier implementations that only measure the amplitude. By measuring phase, the authors can carry out quantitative nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and image processing that cannot be done with amplitude or phase alone. The effective 2-D point spread function of the microscope is modified by spatial filtering of the digitized complex images. In various images, the transverse resolution is improved by about 20%, aberration of images of subsurface features is corrected, and surface features are numerically defocused. The last process is used to remove the obscuring effect of surface roughness from images of subsurface features.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.68471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/2433/00068471.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"147","doi":"10.1109/58.68471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image processing for a scanning acoustic microscope that measures amplitude and phase","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1991","displayDocTitle":"Image processing for a scanning acoustic microscope that measures amplitude and phase","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3893581","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18267568","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68471/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image processing for a scanning acoustic microscope that measures amplitude and phase","sourcePdf":"00068471.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041909S","chronDate":"March  1991","isNumber":"2433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"16","articleId":"68471","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":68548,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The first aspect concerns the introduction of a statistical quantity termed extended Hadamard variance to be applied in frequency stability analysis by making use of digital frequency counter measurements. The properties, the potential interest and the usefulness of this parameter are briefly demonstrated and applied to the study of a signal from a synthesizer that is frequency-modulated by white noise followed by the frequency counter and signal processing. It is shown that not only the Hadamard variance but also the Allan variance and the extended two-sample variance are sets of this variance. The second aspect refers to modern requirements for numerical simulation of random noise, emulating phase or frequency fluctuations. The authors describe the autoregressive integrated moving average technique used to generate various types of random noise, including radio propagation FM noise, and the Monte Carlo approach to transform from one distribution to another.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FREQ.1989.68886","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Symposium on Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/813/2439/00068886.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FREQ.1989.68886","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Symposium on Frequency Control","startPage":"331","endPage":"335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended variances and autoregressive/moving average algorithm for the measurement and synthesis of oscillator phase noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=68886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 May-2 Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"Extended variances and autoregressive/moving average algorithm for the measurement and synthesis of oscillator phase noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/68886/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3677241","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"31 May-2 June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended variances and autoregressive/moving average algorithm for the measurement and synthesis of oscillator phase noise","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00068886.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035135S","chronDate":"31 May-2 Jun 1989","isNumber":"2439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"813","citationCount":"3","articleId":"68886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":68887,"authors":[{"name":"F.L.

Compared to similar 0.5- mu m-gate GaAs MESFET wideband amplifiers, the HBT's third-order intercept point (IP3)/DC power ratio is two times greater and the chip size seven times smaller. Compared to similar advanced silicon bipolar and previously reported HBT direct-coupled amplifier designs, the GaAs HBT amplifier reported has twice the bandwidth.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GAAS.1989.69300","publicationTitle":"11th Annual Gallium Arsenide Integrated Circuit (GaAs IC) Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"11th Annual Gallium Arsenide Integrated Circuit (GaAs IC) Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/827/2443/00069300.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"90","doi":"10.1109/GAAS.1989.69300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor MMIC DC to 10 GHz direct-coupled feedback amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 1989","displayDocTitle":"GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor MMIC DC to 10 GHz direct-coupled feedback amplifier","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 1989","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3676449","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/69300/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor MMIC DC to 10 GHz direct-coupled feedback amplifier","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00069300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02901S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 1989","isNumber":"2443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"827","citationCount":"19","articleId":"69300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":69301,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The apparent mechanism for this degradation is the conversion of gaseous hydrogen into atomic hydrogen in Pt metallization, with subsequent doping compensation due to the atomic hydrogen.

The primary example presented is an associative memory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of fault tolerance in neural networks","publicationTitle":"15th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1989.69723","displayPublicationTitle":"15th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel2/859/2447/00069723.pdf","startPage":"753","endPage":"758 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1989.69723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=69723","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/69723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of fault tolerance in neural networks","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3648821","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of fault tolerance in neural networks","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00069723.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072936S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov 1989","isNumber":"2447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"859","citationCount":"10","articleId":"69723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":69726,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The main feature of the control scheme is direct integration of visual data into the serving process without any geometric process of the position and orientation, and without inverse kinematic calculation. Another feature is the use of an artificial neural network for the determination of the change in the joint angles required to achieve the desired position and orientation. This approach is effective because it essentially decomposes complex geometric calculations into a simple mapping of the network.

The current handling capability of power HBTs is found to improve with ballasting resistance. An equation for the optimal ballasting resistance is presented, where the effects of thermal conductivity of the substrate material and the temperature coefficient of the ballasting resistor are taken into account. Current levels of 400 to 800 mA/mm of emitter periphery at case temperatures of 25 to -80 degrees C for power AlGaAs/GaAs HBTs have been obtained using an on-chip lightly doped GaAs emitter ballasting resistor. Device temperature has been measured using both an infrared microradiometer and temperature-sensitive electrical parameters. Steady-state and transient thermal modeling are also performed. Although the measured temperature is spatially nonuniform, the modeling results show that such nonuniformities would occur for a uniform current distribution, as would be expected for an HBT with emitter ballasting resistors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic ballasts","Resistors","Temperature measurement","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Thermal resistance","Thermal conductivity","Gallium arsenide","Equations","Conducting materials","Electric variables measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","gallium arsenide","heterojunction bipolar transistors","III-V semiconductors","power transistors","semiconductor device models","solid-state microwave devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steady state modelling","MBE growth","microwave transistors","MM-wave applications","emitter ballasting resistor","power heterojunction bipolar transistors","current handling capability","optimal ballasting resistance","thermal conductivity","substrate material","temperature coefficient","infrared microradiometer","temperature-sensitive electrical parameters","transient thermal modeling","uniform current distribution","HBT","-80 to 25 degC","AlGaAs-GaAs transistors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/16.69894","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00069894.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/2451/00069894.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.69894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emitter ballasting resistor design for, and current handling capability of AlGaAs/GaAs power heterojunction bipolar transistors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=69894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Emitter ballasting resistor design for, and current handling capability of AlGaAs/GaAs power heterojunction bipolar transistors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/69894/","volume":"38","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3891174","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emitter ballasting resistor design for, and current handling capability of AlGaAs/GaAs power heterojunction bipolar transistors","sourcePdf":"00069894.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051858S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"100","articleId":"69894","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":69903,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Narrower n/sup +/ diffusions require higher anneal temperatures, or longer anneal times, than wider diffusions for complete transitions from the high-resistivity C49 phase to the low-resistivity C54 phase. A model is presented which explains this in terms of the probability of forming C54 nuclei on narrow diffusions and the influence of diffusion width on C54 grain size. The results are that more C49 and C54 nucleation events are required to completely transform narrow lines. For thin TiSi/sub 2/ (40 nm), there is a narrow process window for achieving complete transformation without causing agglomeration of the TiSi/sub 2/. The process window decreases with decreasing silicide thickness. A significantly larger process window is achieved with short-time rapid annealing. Similar studies are performed for CoSi/sub 2/ on n/sup +/ and p/sup +/ diffusions. No linewidth dependence is observed for the transformation from CoSi/sub x/ to CoSi/sub 2/.

When a surface is switched from an inverted to a depleted state, the generation current recovers with a time constant which is strongly temperature dependent and varies from a few milliseconds at room temperature to nearly 3 h at -80 degrees C. This property can be applied to three- and four-phase CCDs by exchanging charge packets between adjacent phases within a cell at a rate that ensures that each phase remains out of inversion for time that is short in comparison to the recovery time. Measurements of this effect have been made on a CCD imager over the temperature range from -40 degrees C to +22 degrees C, and the results agree well with theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/2451/00069907.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"290","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.69907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.69907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=69907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic suppression of interface-state dark current in buried-channel CCDs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dark current","Charge coupled devices","Interface states","Implants","Steady-state","Charge carrier processes","Electron emission","Temperature distribution","Helium","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensors","charge-coupled devices","interface electron states"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interface state dark current dynamic suppression","inverted state","buried channel CCD","time dependence","carrier generation rate","buried-channel charge-coupled devices","depleted state","time constant","charge packets","recovery time","CCD imager","-40 to 22 degC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/69907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic suppression of interface-state dark current in buried-channel CCDs","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3891187","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic suppression of interface-state dark current in buried-channel CCDs","sourcePdf":"00069907.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025744S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"38","articleId":"69907","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":69909,"authors":[{"name":"E.G.

This mechanism is the premature turn-on of the antiblooming structure, and can be characterized by its nonideality factor. It is shown that a lower nonideality factor results in a more linear response. Electrostatic modeling results and measurements show that devices with low-overflow drain (LOD) antiblooming structures can achieve nonideality factors very close to unity and, therefore, offer superior photoresponse linearity. This is especially true for devices with large pixels having low charge capacity, since the maximum voltage swing across the detector is small. Conversely, devices with vertical-overflow drain (VOD) structures are seen to have nonideality factors at best around two and in some other cases even higher, resulting in severe response nonlinearity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/2451/00069909.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"302","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.69909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.69909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=69909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photoresponse nonlinearity of solid-state image sensors with antiblooming protection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid state circuits","Image sensors","Protection","Voltage","Detectors","Linearity","Capacitance","Image analysis","Temperature sensors","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrostatic modelling","MOSFET","bipolar transistor","low-overflow drain antiblooming structures","vertical overflow drain structures","physical mechanism","photoresponse nonlinearity","solid-state image sensors","antiblooming protection","nonideality factors","voltage swing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/69909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Photoresponse nonlinearity of solid-state image sensors with antiblooming protection","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3891189","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photoresponse nonlinearity of solid-state image sensors with antiblooming protection","sourcePdf":"00069909.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035858S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"12","articleId":"69909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":69919,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The measurement system consists of transmit and receive antennas in the bistatic configuration, mode transitions, precision coaxial cables, and the network analyzer. Diffraction effects of the edges of the sample are minimized by using spot-focusing horn lens antennas, which focus most of the energy on a one-wavelength-diameter circular section of the sample. A new free-space bistatic calibration technique is developed to eliminate errors due to multiple reflections between transmit and receive antennas via the surface of the sample. The effect of defocusing due to the obliquely incident plane wave with focused antennas is minimized by introducing correction factors which modify measured reflection coefficients.

Dispersed terminals transmit packets of speech information to a central base station. When its speech activity detector indicates the beginning of a talkspurt, a terminal contends with other terminals for access to an available time slot. After the base station detects the first packet in the talkspurt, the terminal reserves future time slots for transmission of subsequent speech packets. The influence of several variables on PRMA efficiency, defined as the number of conversations per channel, is examined. The number of channels is the ratio of transmission rate to speech coding rate. It is found that with 32-kb/s speech coding and 720-kb/s transmission (22.5 channels), PRMA supports up to 37 simultaneous conversations, or 1.64 conservations per channel. The number of conversations per channel is at least 1.5 over a wide range of packet sizes (8 ms of speech per packet to 34 ms) and for all systems with 16 or more channels (transmission rate >or=512 kb/s, with 32-kb/s speech coding). Other factors studied are the sensitivity of the speech activity detector, the retransmission probability of the contention scheme, and the maximum time delay for the transmission of speech packets.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/2453/00069985.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"176","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.69985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.69985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2453","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=69985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency of packet reservation multiple access","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Time division multiple access","Speech coding","Corporate acquisitions","Detectors","Telephony","Communication system control","Packet switching","Access protocols","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-access systems","packet switching","protocols","voice communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersed terminals","protocol","packet reservation multiple access","PRMA","slotted ALOHA","time-division multiple access","TDMA","speech information","central base station","speech activity detector","talkspurt","time slot","speech packets","transmission rate","speech coding rate","simultaneous conversations","conservations per channel","packet sizes","retransmission probability","contention scheme","maximum time delay","32 kbit/s","720 kbit/s","512 kbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/69985/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency of packet reservation multiple access","volume":"40","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3891572","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency of packet reservation multiple access","sourcePdf":"00069985.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042823S","chronDate":"Feb.  1991","isNumber":"2453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"329","articleId":"69985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":69987,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This algorithm is inherently parallel and does not rely on a particular structure of the interference graph. The results obtained so far indicate that the algorithm can be used to obtain an optimum solution. It was applied successfully for inhomogeneous interference conditions and channel demand. Cochannel and cosite constraints were taken into account, and the extension to any other technical restrictions will be possible in an obvious way. The examples studied to date are of a relatively small size; the question remains of how the algorithm behaves when applied to larger and more complex examples. The disadvantages of the algorithm are its long calculation time compared to graph coloring algorithms and the difficulty of finding appropriate parameters. However, the algorithm was not optimized for speed, and the parameter search may be a question of experience.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/69987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"40","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3901833","displayDocTitle":"Channel assignment for cellular radio using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel assignment for cellular radio using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00069987.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04535S","chronDate":"Feb.  1991","isNumber":"2453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"201","articleId":"69987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":69988,"authors":[{"name":"I.

This implementation of a five-microphone adaptive Griffiths-Jim array can handle FIR filters with up to 128 taps behind each microphone at a sampling rate of 8 kHz. The filter structure makes it possible to combine an adaptive array with a noise canceler. The near-field problem has been solved by using focusing, a speech-controlled adaptive algorithm, and a short hourglass. Preliminary measurements indicate a considerable potential for this technique in hands-free mobile telephony. The array gives a 20-30 dB suppression of a broadband jammer covering 300-1100 Hz, even with three reflecting walls surrounding the microphone.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/69988/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1991","volume":"40","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3901834","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A multi-DSP implementation of a broad-band adaptive beamformer for use in a hands-free mobile radio telephone","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-DSP implementation of a broad-band adaptive beamformer for use in a hands-free mobile radio telephone","sourcePdf":"00069988.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045322S","chronDate":"Feb.  1991","isNumber":"2453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","articleId":"69988","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":69989,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

It is found that propagation in rural areas is dominated by interference between the direct, line-of-sight ray and a specular roadway-reflected ray. In urban areas, the addition of four specular wall-reflected rays adequately represents microcell propagation. The dependence of mean power falloff, measured mean power and calculated power on distance was determined. The lambda /2 scale microvariations of the received power are reduced compared to the variations in present cellular radio systems. For urban sites using omnidirectional base and mobile antennas, the RMS delay spread due to road- and wall-reflected rays was obtained from a six-ray model. Using a 20-dB horn for the mobile antenna can reduce this delay spread.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.69989","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/2453/00069989.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.69989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"203","endPage":"210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Radio propagation at microwave frequencies for line-of-sight microcellular mobile and personal communications","volume":"40","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3891574","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/69989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio propagation at microwave frequencies for line-of-sight microcellular mobile and personal communications","sourcePdf":"00069989.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039078S","chronDate":"Feb.  1991","isNumber":"2453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"217","articleId":"69989","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":69991,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

Directional sensitivity is obtained by using an antenna array at the base station, possibly both in receiving and transmitting mode. A scheme for separating several signals at the same frequency is proposed. The method is based on high-resolution direction-finding followed by optimal combination of the antenna outputs. Comparison with a method based on reference signals is made.
