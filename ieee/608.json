This requires however that the precise locations of the glottal closure instants (GCIs) are available. The focus of this paper is the evaluation of automatic methods for the detection of GCIs directly from the speech waveform. Five state-of-the-art GCI detection algorithms are compared using six different databases with contemporaneous electroglottographic recordings as ground truth, and containing many hours of speech by multiple speakers. The five techniques compared are the Hilbert Envelope-based detection (HE), the Zero Frequency Resonator-based method (ZFR), the Dynamic Programming Phase Slope Algorithm (DYPSA), the Speech Event Detection using the Residual Excitation And a Mean-based Signal (SEDREAMS) and the Yet Another GCI Algorithm (YAGA). The efficacy of these methods is first evaluated on clean speech, both in terms of reliabililty and accuracy. Their robustness to additive noise and to reverberation is also assessed. A further contribution of the paper is the evaluation of their performance on a concrete application of speech processing: the causal-anticausal decomposition of speech. It is shown that for clean speech, SEDREAMS and YAGA are the best performing techniques, both in terms of identification rate and accuracy. ZFR and SEDREAMS also show a superior robustness to additive noise and reverberation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6080715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12485328","htmlLink":"/document/6080715/","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Glottal Closure Instants From Speech Signals: A Quantitative Review","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Glottal Closure Instants From Speech Signals: A Quantitative Review","sourcePdf":"tasl-drugman-2170835-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085477S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6125258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"6125258","articleId":"6080715","onlineDate":"14 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6080717,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The advantages of quantizing the first-stage residue in time domain versus traditional voltage domain are presented. The dc gain requirement of the first-stage residue amplifier is relaxed by reference-scaling and reference-recycling schemes. This enables the use of a very simple telescopic cascode amplifier in the gain stage. The second-stage VCO linearity is improved by a differential measurement of VCO frequency. Power consumption in the second stage is reduced by time-to-digital conversion for fine quantization of the VCO phase. Simulation results are presented for the design of a 13-bit 20-Msps ADC in 65-nm CMOS process.

Signal alignment (SA) signaling is possible to recover this gain but may suffer from a signal power loss. To improve the spectral efficiency of multicarrier code-division multiple-access (MC-CDMA) TWR systems, we develop an equivalent SA (ESA) signaling procedure. Simply by aligning the received symbols after despreading instead of aligning the received signals as in SA signaling, ESA signaling has more feasible solutions than SA signaling, and its performance and complexity depend on the spreading sequences. This allows us to improve the system performance by optimizing ESA signaling and to reduce its complexity by designing the spreading sequences. Specifically, we develop optimal ESA signaling to maximize the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) under the interference-free constraint. Then, we design the spreading sequence to obtain a low-complexity ESA-based frequency-domain equalizer (FDE), i.e., ESA-based one-tap FDE, and to provide the maximal diversity gain for the one-tap FDE. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that ESA signaling is more spectral efficient than SA signaling for MC-CDMA TWR systems.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2175952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6129945/06080738.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2175952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129945","startPage":"237","endPage":"248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equivalent Signal-Alignment-Based Frequency-Domain Equalization for MC-CDMA Two-Way Relay Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6080738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Equivalent Signal-Alignment-Based Frequency-Domain Equalization for MC-CDMA Two-Way Relay Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6080738/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471795","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6080738/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equivalent Signal-Alignment-Based Frequency-Domain Equalization for MC-CDMA Two-Way Relay Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-liu-2175952-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095453S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6129945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6129945","articleId":"6080738","onlineDate":"14 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6080743,"authors":[{"name":"Yuzhe Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yuzhe Jin (S'07) received the B.E. degree in computer science and technology from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2005 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, in 2011.","His research interests are in statistical signal processing, sparse signal recovery, compressed sensing, information theory, natural language processing, and machine learning."]},"firstName":"Yuzhe","lastName":"Jin","id":"37534839200"},{"name":"Young-Han Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Young-Han Kim (S'99\u2013M'06) received the B.S. degree with honors in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1996 and the M.S. degrees in electrical engineering and statistics and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2001, 2006, and 2006, respectively.","In July 2006, he joined the University of California San Diego, La Jolla, where he is currently an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

The main focus is finding the sufficient and necessary condition on the number of measurements for support recovery to be reliable. By drawing an analogy between the problem of support recovery and the problem of channel coding over the Gaussian multiple-access channel (MAC), and exploiting mathematical tools developed for the latter problem, we obtain an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the performance limits of support recovery. Specifically, when the number of nonzero entries of the sparse signal is held fixed, the exact asymptotics on the number of measurements sufficient and necessary for support recovery is characterized. In addition, we show that the proposed methodology can deal with a variety of models of sparse signal recovery, hence demonstrating its potential as an effective analytical tool.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2170116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6094243/06080743.pdf","startPage":"7877","endPage":"7892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2170116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6094243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limits on Support Recovery of Sparse Signals via Multiple-Access Communication Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6080743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6080743/","displayDocTitle":"Limits on Support Recovery of Sparse Signals via Multiple-Access Communication Techniques","volume":"57","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12391360","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6080743/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limits on Support Recovery of Sparse Signals via Multiple-Access Communication Techniques","sourcePdf":"tit-jin-2170116-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112041S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6094243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6094243","articleId":"6080743","onlineDate":"14 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6080744,"authors":[{"name":"Sherif Sayed Ahmed","affiliation":["Rohde and Schwarz GmbH and Company KG, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6097087/6080744/6080744-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sherif Sayed Ahmed (M'09) received the B.Sc. degree (with honors) in electronics and communication engineering from Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt, in 2004, and the M.Sc. degree in microwave engineering from the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany, in 2007.","From 2007 to 2010, he was a Researcher with the Chair for Microwave Engineering and High-Frequency Technology, University of Erlangen\u2013Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany, where he conducted his doctoral study in the field of microwave and millimeter-wave imaging technologies in a close collaboration with Rohde & Schwarz GmbH & Co.

Imaging systems using monostatic arrays suffer from the high number of antenna positions, making a fully electronic solution very costly and impractical. Multistatic arrays, however, offer the chance for high reduction factors in the number of antennas, and then allow for fully electronic solutions. Here, a new array architecture is presented, which is suitable for real-time operation and is capable of delivering high image quality in means of resolution and dynamic range. Various technological solutions were developed for the imaging purpose, which are introduced in detail. An example array for operation from 72 to 80 GHz is demonstrated. The imaging system hardware is introduced, along with several imaging results of humans with concealed objects.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6097087/06080744.pdf","startPage":"3567","endPage":"3576","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2172812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2172812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6097087","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6080744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Fully Electronic Active Real-Time Imager Based on a Planar Multistatic Sparse Array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Apertures","Planar arrays","Radio frequency","Microwave imaging","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","microwave imaging","millimetre wave imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully electronic active real-time imager","planar multistatic sparse array","active millimeter-wave","microwave imaging system","monostatic array","multistatic array","array architecture","imaging system hardware","digital beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital beamforming","microwave imaging","millimeter-wave imaging","planar arrays","sparse array"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6080744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Fully Electronic Active Real-Time Imager Based on a Planar Multistatic Sparse Array","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6080744/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408804","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Fully Electronic Active Real-Time Imager Based on a Planar Multistatic Sparse Array","sourcePdf":"tmtt-ahmed-2172812-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073687S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6097087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"6097087","articleId":"6080744","onlineDate":"14 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6080746,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Constant delays exist in the conventional dedicated communication channels, while the future usage of open communication networks will introduce time-varying delays. Those delays would degrade the dynamic performance of LFC and in the worst case, cause instability. The maximal delay time which allows an LFC scheme embedded with controllers to retain stable is defined as the delay margin. This paper investigates the delay-dependent stability of the LFC scheme by using Lyaponuv-theory based delay-dependent criterion and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) techniques. Case studies are carried out based on one-area and multi-area LFC schemes installed with proportional-integral (PI) controllers, respectively. Relationship between the gains of PI controller and the delay margin of the LFC scheme are investigated and results obtained can be used to tune the PI controllers to achieve a compromise between the dynamic performance and the delay margin. Both constant and time-varying delays are considered. The effectiveness of the criterion used is verified by simulation studies.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2172821","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6186889/06080746.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2172821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6186889","startPage":"932","endPage":"941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-Dependent Stability for Load Frequency Control With Constant and Time-Varying Delays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6080746","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Delay-Dependent Stability for Load Frequency Control With Constant and Time-Varying Delays","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6080746/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12692022","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6080746/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-Dependent Stability for Load Frequency Control With Constant and Time-Varying Delays","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-jiang-2172821-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096808S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6186889","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"346","xplore-issue":"6186889","articleId":"6080746","onlineDate":"14 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":6080753,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey A.

The architecture uses a dual-wavelength photonic signal source based on stimulated Brillouin scattering to generate the millimeter-wave carrier signal through photomixing. Data is encoded onto the optical signals and is upconverted directly to the millimeter-wave carrier through a photonic upconversion process, which does not require electronic upconversion. The data is encoded onto one optical wavelength in a single-sideband fashion, which affords significant dispersion tolerance over long remoting distances compared with standard double-sideband modulation. The prototype architecture was tested at ranges of 2-30 m indoors and 78 m outdoors, demonstrating a building-to-building link. Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) and quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation formats were tested, with BPSK data rates up to 3 Gb/s and QPSK data rates up to 2.64 Gb/s. Good bit-error ratios are demonstrated as a function of received power and range for a fixed transmit power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6080753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6080753/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408806","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Wireless Communication Using Dual-Wavelength Photonic Signal Generation and Photonic Upconversion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-Wave Wireless Communication Using Dual-Wavelength Photonic Signal Generation and Photonic Upconversion","sourcePdf":"tmtt-nanzer-2171710-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085618S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6097087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6097087","articleId":"6080753","onlineDate":"14 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6080867,"authors":[{"name":"Giorgio Licciardi","affiliation":["Gipsa-Laboratory, Grenoble Institute of Technology, France"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Licciardi","id":"38511793100"},{"name":"Prashanth Reddy Marpu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland"],"firstName":"Prashanth Reddy","lastName":"Marpu","id":"37594773800"},{"name":"Jon Atli Benediktsson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland"],"firstName":"Jon Atli","lastName":"Benediktsson","id":"38231866900"},{"name":"Jocelyn Chanussot","affiliation":["Gipsa-Laboratory, Grenoble Institute of Technology, France"],"firstName":"Jocelyn","lastName":"Chanussot","id":"37265876800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2201-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2202-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2200-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-6276"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-6268"},{"format":"CD","value":"2158-6268"}],"articleNumber":"6080867","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Hyperspectral imaging","Accuracy","Soil","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["morphological profiles","autoassociative neural networks","hyperspectral data classification","spectral information","spatial information","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Morphological profiles","auto-associative neural networks","feature reduction","classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6080867","abstract":"Recently, morphological profiles have be observed as good tools to fuse spectral and spatial information to produce better classification results.

An example of this for anomaly detection is the well known RX algorithm, a statistical measure of the anomalousness of individual pixels when compared to the mean and covariance of the image. While these models perform well for several applications, as sensor resolution improves, and thus, complex clutter in the image has a stronger impact, the simple assumptions behind these algorithms are not necessarily well-met. Here, we propose a novel approach to spectral image processing that instead models the data using the concept of a high dimensional graph. The pixels are considered in the spectral space as the nodes (vertices) of the graph and edges are created connecting them if two nodes satisfy some similarity criterion. Given this spectral graph, there are several metrics that can be computed related to the overall graph connectivity, as well as the connectivity of individual pixels to the graph. This latter metric is used here as the anomaly detection metric. A hyperspectral image is tiled (thus providing a computational advantage in addition to a spatially adaptive background model) and the graph computed per tile. Each pixel in the tile is then assigned an anomalousness score based on its weighted vertex volume, or connectivity, to the graph. Results are presented for a reflective hyperspectral image with known targets and are shown to be comparable to the RX algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/WHISPERS.2011.6080899","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6071746/6080842/06080899.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WHISPERS.2011.6080899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6080842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A graph theoretic approach to anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6080899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6080899/","displayDocTitle":"A graph theoretic approach to anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagery","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12386200","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6080899/","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A graph theoretic approach to anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagery","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"whispers2011submission25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055888S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6071746","isNumber":"6080842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6071746","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6080842","articleId":"6080899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6080906,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Within this framework, since no prior knowledge about the target is assumed, pixels that have different spectral content from typical background pixels are identified as spectral anomalies. The work presented here investigates this issue and develops a spectral-based algorithm for automatic global AD consisting in a two stage process. First, the background Probability Density Function (PDF) is approximated through a data-adaptive kernel density estimator. Then, anomalies are detected as those pixels that deviate from such a background model on the basis of the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) decision rule. Real hyperspectral data are employed to show the potential of data-adaptive background PDF estimation for detection of anomalies in a scene with respect to conventional non-adaptive PDF estimators.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6071746/6080842/06080919.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)","doi":"10.1109/WHISPERS.2011.6080919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WHISPERS.2011.6080919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6080842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6080919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An anomaly detection architecture based on a data-adaptive density estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Kernel","Hyperspectral imaging","Bandwidth","Probability density function","Data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","geophysical image processing","object detection","probability","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data adaptive density estimation","hyperspectral anomaly detection","hyperspectral sensors","spectral based algorithm","probability density function","likelihood ratio test","PDF estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hyperspectral data","anomaly detection","multivariate density estimation","variable-bandwidth kernel density estimation","bandwidth selection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6080919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"An anomaly detection architecture based on a data-adaptive density estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6080919/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12386220","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An anomaly detection architecture based on a data-adaptive density estimation","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"whispers2011submission46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052656S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6071746","isNumber":"6080842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6071746","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6080842","articleId":"6080919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6080920,"authors":[{"name":"Stefania Matteoli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefania","lastName":"Matteoli","id":"37546337200"},{"name":"Marco Diani","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Diani","id":"37269423000"},{"name":"Giovanni Corsini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Corsini","id":"37269421300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2201-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2202-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2200-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-6276"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-6268"},{"format":"CD","value":"2158-6268"}],"articleNumber":"6080920","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"abstract":"This paper focuses on the detection of targets placed in close proximity by means of local covariance-based anomaly detectors. Specifically, RX algorithm is considered as a case-study in order to show how covariance corruption due to target signal contamination within local background pixels can be mitigated by means of robust sample covariance matrix estimators. Contrary to previous works, where the heavy computational complexity of robust covariance estimator has prevented its local application or required a too high computational demand, here robust covariance estimation is selectively applied only on those image pixels most susceptible to covariance corruption. This is achieved by performing a quick local test at each pixel based on the sample kurtosis. Real data are employed to give experimental evidence of the performance provided by the proposed AD strategy in terms of both detection and computational efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011

An underlying main question is actually the trade-off between describing the background clutter with many parameters (case of RX), harder to locally estimate, and considering a model with fewer parameters (case of GMRF), thus easier to estimate from the local clutter only. The study includes the issue of reducing the spectral dimension with linear second order and higher order statistics based methods.

Anomaly detection detects pixels in the hyperspectral data cube whose spectra differ significantly from the background spectra. Most existing methods estimate the spectra of the (local or global) background and then detect anomalies as pixels with a large spectral distance w.r.t. the determined background spectra. Many types of anomaly detectors have been proposed in literature. The most well-known anomaly detector is the RX detector that calculates the Mahalanobis distance between the pixel under test and the background. This paper investigates the sub-pixel detection performance of two classes of anomaly detectors: the family of RX-based detectors and the segmentation-based anomaly detectors. Representative examples of each class are selected and results obtained on three different datacubes are analyzed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6071746/6080842/06080971.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)","doi":"10.1109/WHISPERS.2011.6080971","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WHISPERS.2011.6080971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6080842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6080971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of the sub-pixel performance of anomaly detectors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Hyperspectral imaging","Covariance matrix","Computer aided manufacturing","Image segmentation","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subpixel performance","hyperspectral data cube","RX detector","Mahalanobis distance","subpixel detection performance","segmentation based anomaly detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","sub-pixel detection","hyperspectral data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6080971/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of the sub-pixel performance of anomaly detectors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6080971/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12386270","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of the sub-pixel performance of anomaly detectors","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"whispers2011submission95.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041504S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6071746","isNumber":"6080842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6071746","xplore-issue":"6080842","articleId":"6080971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6081085,"authors":[{"name":"Raivio Yrjo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, School of Science, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Raivio","lastName":"Yrjo","id":"38230038700"},{"name":"Dave Rushil","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, School of Science, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Dave","lastName":"Rushil","id":"38230037300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-319-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-320-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6081085","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":930},"abstract":"Cloud computing is one of the most widely used terms in IT today. Some experts regard cloud computing as hype, but others believe that clouds will have a longer future. Although web 2.0 companies have warmly welcomed clouds, mobile operators have taken a more cautious approach to this new phenomenon. However, new opportunities are opening up to operators, and a number of steps can be followed to take advantage of this development. First of all, the Open Telco concept underlines the power of open APIs that are important prerequisites for the clouds. Secondly, operators can start to utilize clouds in their own infrastructure. However, the operators that have most to gain from cloud computing are the Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO), and this paper focuses on them in particular. The research methodology is based on an action research and data analysis. MVNO experts were interviewed twice according to the Delphi method. The main findings were verified with a proof of concept. Finally, the results are critically evaluated, the next research topics are proposed and conclusions are drawn.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 15th International Conference on Intelligence in Next Generation Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6066598/6081051/06081085.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"258","publicationTitle":"2011 15th International Conference on Intelligence in Next Generation Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICIN.2011.6081085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIN.2011.6081085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081051","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081085","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud computing in mobile networks \u2014 Case MVNO","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computer architecture","Telecommunications","Mobile communication","Business","Interviews","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","cloud computing","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","MVNO","Web 2.0 companies","mobile operators","API","mobile virtual network operators","Delphi method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MVNO","BSS/OSS","CRM","Telecom Cloud","Hybrid Cloud"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081085/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cloud computing in mobile networks \u2014 Case MVNO","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081085/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386705","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud computing in mobile networks \u2014 Case MVNO","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p253raivio.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068307S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6066598","isNumber":"6081051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6066598","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6081051","articleId":"6081085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6081158,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Hu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Anyang Normal University, Anyang, Henan, China"],"lastName":"Meng Hu","id":"37087420095"},{"name":"Lili Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Anyang Normal University, Anyang, Henan, China"],"lastName":"Lili Wang","id":"37087338794"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0246-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0247-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6081158","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delays","neural nets","nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["almost periodic solution","general neural networks","impulsive nonlinear neural networks","variable time delays","existence exponential stability","global exponential stability","impulsive system","nonimpulsive system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Impulsive neural networks","Exponential dichotomy","Almost periodic solution","Global exponential stability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081158","abstract":"In this paper, we consider an impulsive nonlinear neural networks with variable time delays.

Experiments show that the performance of our method is better than the existing methods in most situations.","doi":"10.1109/ICSSEM.2011.6081285","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on System science, Engineering design and Manufacturing informatization","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on System science, Engineering design and Manufacturing informatization","pdfPath":"/iel5/6067546/6081244/06081285.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSSEM.2011.6081285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient resource management for cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081285/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient resource management for cloud computing","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386808","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081285/","conferenceDate":"22-23 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient resource management for cloud computing","confLoc":"Guiyang, China","sourcePdf":"P233236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078773S","chronDate":"22-23 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6067546","isNumber":"6081244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6067546","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6081244","articleId":"6081285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6081305,"authors":[{"name":"Shangqing Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Shangqing Zhang","id":"38238814900"},{"name":"Hongjin Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Control Engineering, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hongjin Liu","id":"38239766300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0246-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0247-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6081305","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tunneling magnetoresistance","Flip-flops","Random access memory","Application specific integrated circuits","Decoding","Field programmable gate arrays","Epitaxial growth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","error detection codes","field programmable gate arrays","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetical analysis","space radiation tolerance techniques","ASIC","triple modular redundancy","TMR","hardened memory cells","error detection","correction code","EDAC","fault detection","SRAM-FPGAs","self-developed space-level processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EDAC","FPGA","on-board computer","Radiation tolerance","SEU","TMR"]}],"abstract":"The space radiation environment introduces multiple kinds of faults on devices used for space application.

Continuous attractor neural network (CANN) can be interpreted as an efficient framework for implementing population coding and decoding. In this work, we show that CANN can account for many empirical principles in multisensory integration. Viewed from single neuron behaviors, CANN model can account for the principle of inverse effectiveness and the spatial principle. From the perspective of the activities of population of neurons, CANN can account for the mathematical rule by which multisensory neurons combine their inputs with respect to different cue reliabilities.","doi":"10.1109/ICSSEM.2011.6081317","pdfPath":"/iel5/6067546/6081244/06081317.pdf","startPage":"352","endPage":"355","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on System science, Engineering design and Manufacturing informatization","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on System science, Engineering design and Manufacturing informatization","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSSEM.2011.6081317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous attractor neural network model of multisensory integration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Continuous attractor neural network model of multisensory integration","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12386825","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6081317/","conferenceDate":"22-23 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous attractor neural network model of multisensory integration","confLoc":"Guiyang, China","sourcePdf":"P352355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045535S","chronDate":"22-23 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6067546","isNumber":"6081244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6067546","xplore-issue":"6081244","articleId":"6081317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6081348,"authors":[{"name":"Mauricio A.

The primary transmission on each channel is modeled by a continuous time Markov on-off process. Cognitive access of the primary channels is realized via channel sensing. Each cognitive user adopts a slotted transmission structure, senses one channel in each slot and makes the transmission decision based on the sensing outcome. The cognitive transmissions in each channel are subject to collision constraints that limit their interference to the primary users. The maximum throughput region of this multiuser cognitive network is characterized by establishing inner and outer bounds. Under tight collision constraints, the inner bound is obtained by a simple orthogonalized periodic sensing with memoryless access policy and its generalizations. The outer bound, on the other hand, is obtained by relating the sum throughput with the interference limits. It is shown that when collision constraints are tight, the outer and inner bounds match. This maximum throughput region result is further extended by a generalized periodic sensing scheme with a mechanism of timing sharing. Under general collision constraints, another outer bound is obtained via Whittle's relaxation and another inner bound obtained via Whittle's index sensing policy with memoryless access. Packet level simulations are used to validate the analytical performance prediction.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.111206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081341","startPage":"1959","endPage":"1969","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6081341/06081349.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Throughput Region of Multiuser Cognitive Access of Continuous Time Markovian Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6081349/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Maximum Throughput Region of Multiuser Cognitive Access of Continuous Time Markovian Channels","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12360045","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Throughput Region of Multiuser Cognitive Access of Continuous Time Markovian Channels","sourcePdf":"1959jsac1011chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069574S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6081341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6081341","articleId":"6081349","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6081353,"authors":[{"name":"Yiyang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6081341/6081353/6081353-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiyang Li received her B.

Despite significant research effort on the UV physical layer, work on protocol design at the upper layers is quite limited. We consider a mobile ad hoc UV network, with each node equipped with a transceiver capable of transmitting in multiple directions and performing omni-directional receptions. Full-duplexing is enabled. We develop efficient neighbor discovery protocols by accounting for the unique UV physical (PHY) layer characteristics, namely varying channel qualities along different scattering directions. In addition to a list of neighbor nodes' identities, our protocols also construct and maintain a table which contains a ranked list of node pointing directions between each pair of nodes in terms of channel qualities. Our approach does not need support from the global positioning system (GPS) or temporal synchronization across nodes like many radio frequency (RF) protocols. Specifically, two algorithms are proposed with and without the need for direction synchronization. We further improve the latter by more efficiently utilizing neighbor feedback. We perform extensive simulations to evaluate our algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.111210","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6081341/06081353.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.111210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081341","startPage":"2002","endPage":"2011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neighbor Discovery for Ultraviolet Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Neighbor Discovery for Ultraviolet Ad Hoc Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081353/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"10","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12360048","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6081353/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neighbor Discovery for Ultraviolet Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"2002jsac1011li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054452S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6081341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6081341","articleId":"6081353","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6081354,"authors":[{"name":"Andrej Stefanov","affiliation":["Information Technology Department, IBU, Skopje, Macedonia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6081341/6081354/6081354-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrej Stefanov (M'01) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Cyril and Methodius University, Skopje, Macedonia, in 1996.

We assume a uniform distribution of nodes over a finite area, and focus for simplicity on a two-dimensional network. The node-to-node channel is modeled using frequency dependent path loss and Ricean fading. We adopt a communication theoretic approach and study the sustainable number of hops through the network as an indicator of the network connectivity, as well as power and bandwidth requirements. The network operation is highly dependent on the node density with two distinct regions of limited performance: the coverage-limited region, where the number of nodes in the network is small, and the interference-limited region, where the number of nodes is large. We show that a desired level of connectivity can be achieved through a judicious selection of the operating frequency, power and bandwidth. Numerical examples illustrate the results of the analysis. These results motivate us to propose a hierarchical underwater acoustic sensor network architecture in which the sensors and the collector stations operate in distinct layers. The hierarchical architecture is supported by the property of the acoustic underwater transmission medium that for each transmission distance there exists an operating frequency for which the narrow-band signal-to-noise ratio is maximized. The sensors and the collector stations are consequently allocated different operating frequencies. We assume a uniform distribution of both sensors and collector stations over the finite area of the sensing field, and model the channel accordingly. The analysis is performed under the assumption that there is interference from other nodes within the same layer of the hierarchy. Numerical examples illustrate the network performance and demonstrate that the preferred operating frequencies ensure network operation without any cross-interference between the collector network and the sensor network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","volume":"29","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"12360049","publicationDate":"December 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081354/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and Performance Analysis of Underwater Acoustic Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Performance Analysis of Underwater Acoustic Networks","sourcePdf":"2012jsac1011stefanov.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063274S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6081341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6081341","articleId":"6081354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6081358,"authors":[{"name":"Shannon D.

In contrast, this paper addresses the use of ambient interference from other man-made emissions as a means to mask the presence of covert communication. Specifically, the high power, wide bandwidth, and repeating structure of pulsed radar systems provide an advantageous framework within which to embed a communication signal. The operating paradigm considered here is that of an RF tag/transponder that is illuminated by the radar and intends to covertly communicate with the radar or some other desired receiver while being masked by the ambient radar backscatter to avoid detection by an intercept receiver. Communication takes place on an intra-pulse (or individual pulse) basis to maximize the data rate. The impact of multipath, and its exploitation using time reversal to achieve spatio-temporal focusing, is considered. The processing gain for the destination receiver and intercept receiver are derived analytically and subsequently used to optimize the parameterization of communication symbol design.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.111215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.111215","startPage":"2057","endPage":"2066","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6081341/06081358.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Characteristics and Metrics for Intra-Pulse Radar-Embedded Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081358/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance Characteristics and Metrics for Intra-Pulse Radar-Embedded Communication","volume":"29","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12360053","publicationDate":"December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6081358/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Characteristics and Metrics for Intra-Pulse Radar-Embedded Communication","sourcePdf":"2057jsac1011blunt.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110915S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6081341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6081341","articleId":"6081358","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6081359,"authors":[{"name":"Dennis Goeckel","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6081341/6081359/6081359-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dennis Goeckel split time between Purdue University and Sundstrand Corporation from 1987-1992, receiving his BSEE from Purdue in 1992.

Two key mechanisms are employed: artificial noise generation from system nodes other than the transmitter and receiver, and a form of multi-user diversity that allows message reception in the presence of the artificial noise. We determine the maximum number of independently-operating and uniformly distributed eavesdroppers that can be present while the desired secrecy is achieved with high probability in the limit of a large number of system nodes. While our main motivation is considering eavesdroppers of unknown location, we first consider the case where the path-loss is identical between all pairs of nodes. In this case, a number of eavesdroppers that is exponential in the number of systems nodes can be tolerated. In the case of uniformly distributed eavesdroppers of unknown location, any number of eavesdroppers whose growth is sub-linear in the number of system nodes can be tolerated. The proposed approach significantly outperforms a power control approach based on standard multi-user diversity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081359/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","volume":"29","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12360054","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","publicationDate":"December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6081359/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Noise Generation from Cooperative Relays for Everlasting Secrecy in Two-Hop Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Noise Generation from Cooperative Relays for Everlasting Secrecy in Two-Hop Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"2067jsac1011goeckel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113893S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6081341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"6081341","articleId":"6081359","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6081368,"authors":[{"name":"David Kaeli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Kaeli","id":"37271686900"},{"name":"David Akodes","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Akodes","id":"38229920200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1954-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1953-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1952-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6081368","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":564},"abstract":"Recently we have seen two exciting trends that have been flooding the market: 1) the movement of graphics processing units into mainstream general-purpose platforms, and 2) the movement of multi-core embedded systems into tablet computing and smartphone spaces. These trends are forcing application developers to rethink how they are going to best utilize these many-core and multi-core heterogeneous platforms to provide new levels of cost/performance/power in a range of emerging application domains. A key driver in this movement is the recognition that traditional graphics devices can play a larger role in computation than was ever considered before. The high performance computing community has fueled this development, and has demonstrated that Graphics Processing Units can be utilized in a range of general purpose and embedded systems applications. By making this class of devices programmable, a new era in heterogeneous computing has begun. We will discuss some of the catalysts behind these changes, and consider what lies ahead in the future for heterogeneous computing. We will touch on current trends in computing core architectures and programming frameworks, as well as discuss what new classes of applications will be possible as we arrive at the intersection of these two vastly different computing domains.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 29th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6066261/6081363/06081368.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 29th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2011.6081368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2011.6081368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081363","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The convergence of HPC and embedded systems in our heterogeneous computing future","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Embedded systems","Performance evaluation","Convergence","Media","Computer architecture","Programming environments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","embedded systems","multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high performance computing","heterogeneous computing","graphics processing units","mainstream general-purpose platform","multicore embedded system","tablet computing","smartphone","many-core heterogeneous platform","multicore heterogeneous platform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"The convergence of HPC and embedded systems in our heterogeneous computing future","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081368/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386580","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The convergence of HPC and embedded systems in our heterogeneous computing future","confLoc":"Amherst, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"009kaaeli.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073185S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6066261","isNumber":"6081363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6066261","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6081363","articleId":"6081368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6081370,"authors":[{"name":"Ankit More","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Ankit","lastName":"More","id":"37403964400"},{"name":"Baris Taskin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Baris","lastName":"Taskin","id":"37265611900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1954-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1953-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1952-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6081370","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":356},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Frequency domain analysis","Metals","Integrated circuit interconnections","Dipole antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","CMOS integrated circuits","finite element analysis","frequency-domain analysis","integrated circuit interconnections","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EM cosimulation","reconfigurable hybrid wireless NoC","2D IC","reconfigurable hybrid wireless network-on-chip","on-chip antenna","wireless network layer","wired network layer metal interconnection","circuit cosimulation technique","3D finite element method","3D FEM","full-wave electro-magnetic analysis","complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology","CMOS technology","frequency domain analysis","signal source","signal sink dynamic switching"]}],"abstract":"The feasibility of the dynamic reconfigurability of the network layer of a hybrid wireless network-on-chip (NoC) that uses on-chip antennas for the wireless network layer and metal interconnects for the wired network layer is studied.

The die and the circuits are modeled according to a typical complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. It is shown that, it is possible to have 1) at least two different frequency domains for the signal sources and 2) the dynamic switching of the signal sinks between the two frequency domains, with minimal design and area overhead.

Stochastic computing, which performs computing with random bits (stochastic bits streams), can be used to enable reliable computation using those unreliable devices. However, one of the major issues of stochastic computing is that applications implemented with this technique are limited by the available computational elements. In this paper, first we will introduce and prove a stochastic absolute value function. Second, we will demonstrate a mathematical analysis of a stochastic tanh function, which is a key component used in a stochastic comparator. Third, we will present a quantitative analysis of a one-parameter linear gain function, and propose a new two-parameter version. The validity of the present stochastic computational elements is demonstrated through four basic digital image processing algorithms: edge detection, frame difference based image segmentation, median filter based noise reduction, and image contrast stretching. Our experimental results show that stochastic implementations tolerate more noise and consume less hardware than their conventional counterparts.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2011.6081391","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 29th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 29th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6066261/6081363/06081391.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2011.6081391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using stochastic computing to implement digital image processing algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Using stochastic computing to implement digital image processing algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081391/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12386598","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081391/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using stochastic computing to implement digital image processing algorithms","confLoc":"Amherst, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"154li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067804S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6066261","isNumber":"6081363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6066261","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"6081363","articleId":"6081391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6081394,"authors":[{"name":"Jue Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jue","lastName":"Wang","id":"38240422400"},{"name":"Xiangyu Dong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiangyu","lastName":"Dong","id":"37407343000"},{"name":"Guangyu Sun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Guangyu","lastName":"Sun","id":"37404006100"},{"name":"Dimin Niu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Dimin","lastName":"Niu","id":"37409787700"},{"name":"Yuan Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Xie","id":"37275778900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1954-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1953-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1952-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6081394","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":986},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient multi-level cell phase-change memory system with data encoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081394","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change materials","Encoding","Computer architecture","Programming","Microprocessors","Writing","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal verification","phase change memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient multilevel cell phase-change memory system","nonvolatile memories","high capacity memory system","program-and-verify scheme","single-level cell","MLC energy overhead","energy-efficient PCM architecture","data comparison write","data encoding architecture"]}],"abstract":"Phase-change memory (PCM) is one of the most promising technologies among emerging non-volatile memories. Recently, the technology of multi-level cell (MLC) for PCM has been developed and a high capacity memory system can be implemented by storing multiple bits in a cell. However, programming MLC PCM involves the program-and-verify scheme. Thus, the energy of programming intermediate states in MLC PCM is considerably larger than that of single-level cell (SLC) PCM. To mitigate the MLC energy overhead, we propose an energy-efficient PCM architecture using data encoding write based on the observation that there are significant value-dependent energy variations in programming MLC PCM. In addition, data comparison write (DCW) is adopted to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed data encoding architecture for MLC PCM. Simulation results show that this encoding architecture achieves 9.6% average energy saving (up to 19.8%) on the plain MLC PCM system, and 12.9% average energy saving (up to 26.7%) on the DCW-adopted MLC PCM system.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2011.6081394","startPage":"175","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 29th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 29th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6066261/6081363/06081394.pdf","endPage":"182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2011.6081394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081394/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient multi-level cell phase-change memory system with data encoding","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6081394/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12386601","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient multi-level cell phase-change memory system with data encoding","confLoc":"Amherst, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"175wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068668S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6066261","isNumber":"6081363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6066261","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6081363","articleId":"6081394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6081395,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Kuan Wu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yen-Kuan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37900623500"},{"name":"Shervin Sharifi","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shervin","lastName":"Sharifi","id":"37391963600"},{"name":"Tajana Simunic Rosing","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tajana Simunic","lastName":"Rosing","id":"37295875800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1954-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1953-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1952-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6081395","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":186},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thermal management","Temperature control","Mathematical model","Hardware","Switches","Equations","Operating systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","system-on-chip","thermal management (packaging)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable distributed thermal management","cooperative distributed thermal management","embedded heterogeneous MPSoC","dedicated hardware accelerator","DHA","low overhead message passing","temperature constraint"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses thermal management in heterogeneous MPSoCs where the power states of the general purpose cores can be controlled by the operating system (OS) while OS is not able to control power states of the dedicated hardware accelerators (DHAs).

The combination of the above two parts lead to a hybrid power estimation that gives a better trade-off between accuracy and speed. The proposed methodology has several benefits: it considers the power consumption of the embedded system in its entirety and leads to accurate estimates without a costly and complex material. The proposed methodology is also scalable for exploring complex embedded architectures. The usefulness and effectiveness of our HSL methodology is validated through a typical mono-processor and multiprocessor embedded system designed around the Xilinx Virtex II Pro FPGA board.

The proposed circuit applies a shaped wordline voltage pulse during read mode and a boosted wordline pulse during write mode. During read, the applied shaped pulse is tuned at nominal voltage for short period of time, whereas for the remaining access time, the wordline voltage is reduced to a lower level. This pulse results in improved read noise margin without any degradation in access time which is explained by examining the dynamic and nonlinear behavior of the SRAM cell. Furthermore, during hold mode, the wordline voltage starts from a negative value and reaches zero voltage, resulting in a lower leakage current compared to conventional SRAM. Our simulations using TSMC 65nm process show that the proposed wordline driver results in 2X improvement in static read noise margin while the write margin is improved by 3X. In addition, the total leakage of the proposed SRAM is reduced by 10% while the total power is improved by 12% in the worst case scenario of a single SRAM cell. The total area penalty is 10% for a 128Kb standard SRAM array.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 29th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 29th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6066261/6081363/06081419.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-level wordline driver for low power SRAMs in nano-scale CMOS technology","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2011.6081419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2011.6081419","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081419","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multi-level wordline driver for low power SRAMs in nano-scale CMOS technology","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386622","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6081419/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-level wordline driver for low power SRAMs in nano-scale CMOS technology","confLoc":"Amherst, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"326moradi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076847S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6066261","isNumber":"6081363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6066261","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6081363","articleId":"6081419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6081426,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Arjomand","affiliation":["HPCAN Laboratory, Computer Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Arjomand","id":"37400275000"},{"name":"Amin Jadidi","affiliation":["HPCAN Laboratory, Computer Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Jadidi","id":"38277816100"},{"name":"Ali Shafiee","affiliation":["HPCAN Laboratory, Computer Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Shafiee","id":"37587734900"},{"name":"Hamid Sarbazi-Azad","affiliation":["HPCAN Laboratory, Computer Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Sarbazi-Azad","id":"38270047600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1954-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1953-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1952-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6081426","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":475},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Phase change materials","Pipelines","Random access memory","Conductivity","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","integrated circuit reliability","phase change memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["morphable phase change memory architecture","frequent zero values","cell size","device scalability","multilevel cell devices","single-level cell","main memory architecture","PARSEC-2 programs","ZM-PCM codes redundant zero","microarchitecture design","coding algorithms","decoding algorithms","quad-core CMP","area-efficient caching mechanism","word length 8 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PCM main memory","Zero-extended value","Low power","Memory lifetime"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081426","abstract":"Phase Change Memory (PCM) is emerging as a high-dense and power-efficient choice for future main memory systems. While PCM cell size is marching towards minimum achievable feature size, recent prototypes effectively improve device scalability by storing multiple bits per each cell. Unfortunately, Multi-Level Cell (MLC) PCM devices offer higher access time and energy when compared to Single-Level Cell (SLC) counterparts making it difficult to incorporate MLC in main memory. To address this challenge, we proposes Zero-value-based Morphable PCM, ZM-PCM for short, a novel MLC-PCM main memory architecture which tries incorporating benefits of both MLC and SLC devices within the same structure. ZM-PCM relies on the observation that zero value at various granularities is frequently occurred within main memory transactions when running PARSEC-2 programs. Motivated by this observation, ZM-PCM codes redundant zero MLC cells into limited bits that is storable in the SLC (or alternatively in devices with fewer bits) form with improved latency, energy, and lifetime with no reduction in available main memory capacity. We evaluate microarchitecture design of morphable PCM cell, coding and decoding algorithms and details of related circuits. We also introduce a simple area-efficient caching mechanism for fast cost-efficient access to coding metadata. Our evaluation on a quad-core CMP with 4GB 8-bit MLC PCM main memory shows that ZM-PCM morphs up to 93% (and 50% on average) of all memory cells with lower densities which directly turns in performance, power and lifetime enhancement.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081363","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 29th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 29th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6066261/6081363/06081426.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2011.6081426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2011.6081426","startPage":"373","endPage":"380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A morphable phase change memory architecture considering frequent zero values","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081426/","displayDocTitle":"A morphable phase change memory architecture considering frequent zero values","htmlLink":"/document/6081426/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12386629","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A morphable phase change memory architecture considering frequent zero values","confLoc":"Amherst, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"373arjomand.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069267S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6066261","isNumber":"6081363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6066261","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6081363","articleId":"6081426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6081427,"authors":[{"name":"Hyung Gyu Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Hyung Gyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37899399600"},{"name":"Seungcheol Baek","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Seungcheol","lastName":"Baek","id":"38237070000"},{"name":"Chrysostomos Nicopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Chrysostomos","lastName":"Nicopoulos","id":"37300402600"},{"name":"Jongman Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Jongman","lastName":"Kim","id":"38185706000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1954-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1953-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1952-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6081427","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Phase change materials","Energy consumption","Memory management","Microprocessors","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","DRAM chips","low-power electronics","memory architecture","phase change memories","power aware computing","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-aware architecture","DRAM cache architecture","performance-aware architecture","hybrid DRAM-PCM main memory system","phase-change memory","memory subsystem","microprocessor architecture","low power consumption","PCM write performance","DRAM technology","energy consumption","power efficiency"]}],"abstract":"The last few years have witnessed the emergence of a promising new memory technology. Phase-Change Memory (PCM) is increasingly viewed as an attractive alternative for the memory sub-system of future microprocessor architectures, mainly because of its inherent ability to scale deeply into the nanoscale regime, and its low power consumption. However, PCM's write performance is its Achilles' heel, especially when compared to the prevalent DRAM technology. This weakness necessitates the deployment of hybridized solutions that fuse DRAM and PCM, in order to attain high overall system performance. In this paper, we set out to explore how various DRAM/PCM hybrid configurations affect system performance and energy consumption, and then proceed with the presentation of a novel architecture that maximizes performance without adversely affecting power efficiency.

Thus, characterization of FinFET devices/gates needs immediate attention for them to become the industry driver in this decade. Ideally, 3D device simulation should be done to enable accurate circuit synthesis. However, this is impractical due to the huge CPU times required. Simulating a 2D cross-section of the device yields 100-1000\u00d7 reduction in CPU time.

This research is based on an observation that completely correct operation of user programs can be guaranteed while using chips with one or more unrepairable memory modules if software-level techniques satisfy two condistions: (1) defects only affect a few memory cells rather than cause malfunction for the entire memory module, and (2) either we do not use any part of the memory affected by the un-repaired defect, or we do use the affected part, but only in a manner that does not excite the un repaired defect to cause errors. This paper proposes a software based defect-tolerance (SBDT) approach in combination with HR to utilize defective memory chips for application-specific systems. The proposed approach requires known and fixed program and information about defective locations for each memory module, hence this paper focuses on SoCs and other application-specific systems built around processors, such as DSP and graphics processors.

In this paper, we focus on the issue of task allocation for multi-processor based systems with hybrid processing resources that can be reconfigured. With the objective of minimizing energy, we propose a fast, energy aware static task mapping heuristic to minimize the average overall energy consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed heuristic is capable of achieving results that are within 20% of the optimal solution while providing orders of magnitude speedup in processing time.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 29th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6066261/6081363/06081444.pdf","startPage":"449","endPage":"450","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 29th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2011.6081444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2011.6081444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081363","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy aware task mapping algorithm for heterogeneous MPSoC based architectures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Computer architecture","Resource management","Quadratic programming","Real time systems","Educational institutions","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","multiprocessing systems","power aware computing","software radio","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy aware task mapping algorithm","heterogeneous MPSoC based architectures","energy management","multimode software defined radio system","task allocation","multiprocessor based system","hybrid processing resources","energy minimization","energy aware static task mapping","energy consumption","processing time speedup"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Energy aware task mapping algorithm for heterogeneous MPSoC based architectures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081444/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386647","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy aware task mapping algorithm for heterogeneous MPSoC based architectures","confLoc":"Amherst, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"449hussien.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038413S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6066261","isNumber":"6081363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6066261","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6081363","articleId":"6081444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6081446,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Du","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Du","id":"38231512700"},{"name":"Peter Varman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Varman","id":"37295624900"},{"name":"Kartik Mohanram","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Kartik","lastName":"Mohanram","id":"37272330500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1954-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1953-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1952-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6081446","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Delay","Analytical models","Error analysis","Logic functions","Design automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static window addition","variable latency adder","sublogarithmic delay","error correction","error rate","SWA-based speculative adder","design exploration","convergence"]}],"abstract":"Speculative adders have attracted strong interest for achieving sublogarithmic delays by exploiting the tradeoffs between correctness and performance. Speculative adders also find use in the design of error-free variable latency adders, which combine speculation with error correction to achieve high performance for low area overhead over traditional adders. This paper describes static window addition (SWA), a novel function speculation technique for the design of low overhead, high performance variable latency adders. Analytical models for the error rate of SWA-based speculative adders are developed to facilitate both design exploration and convergence. We show that on average, variable latency addition using SWA-based speculative adders is 10% faster than the fastest DesignWare adder with area requirements of -5 to 40% for different adder widths.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 29th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 29th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6066261/6081363/06081446.pdf","startPage":"455","endPage":"456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static window addition: A new paradigm for the design of variable latency adders","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2011.6081446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2011.6081446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Static window addition: A new paradigm for the design of variable latency adders","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386648","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6081446/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static window addition: A new paradigm for the design of variable latency adders","confLoc":"Amherst, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"455du.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070024S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6066261","isNumber":"6081363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6066261","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6081363","articleId":"6081446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6081450,"authors":[{"name":"Moustapha El Aoun","affiliation":["Institut T\u00e9l\u00e9com, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne, UMR CNRS 3192 Laboratoriesticc, PRACom, Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Moustapha","lastName":"El Aoun","id":"37936916900"},{"name":"Xavier Lagrange","affiliation":["Institut T\u00e9l\u00e9com, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne, UMR CNRS 3192 Laboratoriesticc, PRACom, Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Lagrange","id":"37269318500"},{"name":"Rapha\u00ebl Le Bidan","affiliation":["Institut T\u00e9l\u00e9com, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne, UMR CNRS 3192 Laboratoriesticc, PRACom, Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Rapha\u00ebl","lastName":"Le Bidan","id":"37661791800"},{"name":"Ramesh Pyndiah","affiliation":["Institut T\u00e9l\u00e9com, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne, UMR CNRS 3192 Laboratoriesticc, PRACom, Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Pyndiah","id":"37269802500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-908849-25-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1786-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-2-908849-26-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1882-5621"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1347-6890"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1347-6890"}],"articleNumber":"6081450","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and optimization of hybrid single packet and multiple-packets incremental redundancy in the presence of channel state information","abstract":"In many wireless transmission systems, an estimate of the Channel State Information (CSI) is available.

We consider an LDPC product code resulting from the concatenation of Multiple Serially Concatenated Multiple Parity-Check (M-SC-MPC) codes. Every source encodes its data using the same M-SC-MPC code and broadcasts the codeword to relay and destination. The relay decodes and stores all codewords from sources in the rows of a matrix and encodes the columns using another M-SC-MPC code. Only the redundancy part generated by the relay is forwarded to the destination. At the destination, the codewords from the sources and the redundancy part from the relay form an observation of a product codeword whose parity check matrix is sparse. This LDPC product code can be iteratively decoded at destination using the low complexity sum-product algorithm. Since there are errors at the input of the relay-destination channel, an appropriate log-likelihood ratio is used in the LDPC decoding at destination in order to reduce the error propagation effect. The system error performance is given on the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and the Rayleigh flat fading channel.","publicationTitle":"2011 The 14th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 The 14th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6068193/6081449/06081463.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-source cooperative communications using low-density parity-check product codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-source cooperative communications using low-density parity-check product codes","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386856","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081463/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-source cooperative communications using low-density parity-check product codes","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1569443079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052298S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6068193","isNumber":"6081449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6068193","xplore-issue":"6081449","articleId":"6081463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"National Institute of Inform","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6081466,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Holakouei","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Holakouei","id":"37706364700"},{"name":"Ad\u00e3o Silva","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ad\u00e3o","lastName":"Silva","id":"37401627600"},{"name":"At\u00edlio Gameiro","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"At\u00edlio","lastName":"Gameiro","id":"37270506000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-908849-25-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1786-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-2-908849-26-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1882-5621"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1347-6890"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1347-6890"}],"articleNumber":"6081466","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Vectors","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Bit error rate","Minimization","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","error statistics","linear codes","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation","precoding","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed precoding","centralized power allocation","multicell OFDM systems","distributed linear precoding","precoder vectors","per-BS power constraint","bit error rate","signal-to-interference noise ratio","LTE specifications","DVSINR precoders","DZF precoders"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose and compare several distributed linear precoding schemes for the downlink of multicell OFDM based systems. The precoders are designed in two phases: first the precoder vectors are computed in a distributed manner at each BS considering several criteria; then the system is further optimized through power allocation. Two centralized power allocation algorithms with per-BS power constraint and different complexity tradeoffs are proposed: minimization of the instantaneous average BER and minimization of the sum of inverse of signal-to-interference noise ratio. The performance of the proposed schemes is compared considering typical pedestrian scenarios based on LTE specifications. The numerical results show that the performance of the DVSINR and DZF precoders with the proposed power allocation schemes is close.","publicationTitle":"2011 The 14th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 The 14th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6068193/6081449/06081466.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed precoding with centralized power allocation techniques for multicell OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081466/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed precoding with centralized power allocation techniques for multicell OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386859","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081466/","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed precoding with centralized power allocation techniques for multicell OFDM systems","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1569443283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068497S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6068193","isNumber":"6081449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6068193","xplore-issue":"6081449","articleId":"6081466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"National Institute of Inform","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6081472,"authors":[{"name":"Emiliano Dall'Anese","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Emiliano","lastName":"Dall'Anese","id":"37392305700"},{"name":"Silvano Pupolin","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Silvano","lastName":"Pupolin","id":"37295864200"},{"name":"Antonio Assalini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Assalini","id":"37540453000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-908849-25-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1786-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-2-908849-26-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1882-5621"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1347-6890"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1347-6890"}],"articleNumber":"6081472","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Mutual information","Training","Correlation","Covariance matrix","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","information theory","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sum mutual information","block-faded MIMO MAC","LMMSE channel estimation","packet transmission","linear minimum mean squared error","multiple-input multiple-output multiple access channel","information-theoretic bounds","block fading channel model"]}],"abstract":"The effect of a training-based linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) channel estimator on the sum mutual information of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access channel (MAC) is investigated.

We first derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of PCC-OFDM and SCC-OFDM. Then, for the same bit rate, we compare the performance of the two schemes with the normal OFDM. We show the effect of clipping on the two schemes under additive white Gaussian noise channel and frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel. Also, we study the improvement of out-of-band power (OOBP) by SCC-OFDM. Our results show that the SCC-OFDM has less PAPR than the normal OFDM and far less than PCC-OFDM. Also, we show that, clipping destroys the performance of PCC-OFDM compared to the normal OFDM and SCC-OFDM.

The RMPPM system can transmit the bit data using the repeated-permutation of the slot positions and several orthogonal codes. The RMPPM system can improve the throughput performance of the conventional PPM systems in the single user case. However, with increasing the number of code per frame, Multiple Access Interference (MAI) also increases in the multi-user case. To avoid MAI, we consider a Reduction Rule (RR) of orthogonal codes at a transmitter. On the other hand, we apply an Interference Cancellation (IC) using modified prime codes at a receiver. As results, BER can be greatly improved by RR and IC. The RR and IC is the effective way for the RMPPM system in the multi-user case of optical wireless communication.","publicationTitle":"2011 The 14th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 The 14th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6068193/6081449/06081497.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081449","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Repeated-permutation MPPM/CDMA with interference avoidance and cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Repeated-permutation MPPM/CDMA with interference avoidance and cancellation","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081497/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386890","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6081497/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repeated-permutation MPPM/CDMA with interference avoidance and cancellation","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1569452297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048867S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6068193","isNumber":"6081449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6068193","xplore-issue":"6081449","articleId":"6081497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"National Institute of Inform","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6081499,"authors":[{"name":"Min Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Min Wang","id":"37087207043"},{"name":"Chunyan Feng","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Chunyan Feng","id":"37087272049"},{"name":"Tiankui Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Tiankui Zhang","id":"37087160017"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-908849-25-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1786-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-2-908849-26-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1882-5621"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1347-6890"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1347-6890"}],"articleNumber":"6081499","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081499","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unicast","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Simulated annealing","Quality of service","Load management","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","multicast communication","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing","transmission mode selection","multicast services","LTE networks","single frequency network","SFN mode","point-to-multipoint mode","PTM mode","point-to-point mode","PTP mode"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["single frequency network","point-to-multipoint","point-to-point","simulated annealing"]}],"pdfPath":"/iel5/6068193/6081449/06081499.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 The 14th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 The 14th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simulated annealing algorithm for the transmission mode selection of multicast services in LTE networks","abstract":"A simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is proposed for the transmission mode selection of multicast services in LTE networks. The multicast services can be transmitted by single frequency network (SFN) mode and point-to-multipoint (PTM) mode, and the unicast services are delivered with point-to-point (PTP) mode. To avoid the network congestion in LTE networks with the multicast and unicast mixed services, the demanded resources of the maximum load cell is minimized by selecting the optimal mode between SFN and PTM for multicast services.

The classic decoders based on belief propagation offer very high performance but have high implementation complexity. Therefore over the last decade simpler architectures such as the bit flipping class of algorithms have been researched. Recently, a number of adaptive threshold algorithms have been proposed in which at each iteration a bit is either flipped if it is below an inversion threshold, or the threshold is lowered. By choosing certain values of the scaling factor, the scaling can be efficiently implemented using a small number of shift and add operations. This work looks at how the scaling factor affects the convergence and error performance, and investigates an algorithm that switches between two scaling values based on the syndrome sum. The dual scaling method maintained the error performance compared to that with a single scaling but the iteration count was significantly reduced.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081517/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386910","htmlLink":"/document/6081517/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Investigation of simple threshold shifting for bit-flip decoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of simple threshold shifting for bit-flip decoding","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1569459661.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066724S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6068193","isNumber":"6081449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6068193","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6081449","articleId":"6081517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"National Institute of Inform","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6081519,"authors":[{"name":"Liliana Bolea","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications (TSC), Universitat Polit\u00e9cnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Liliana","lastName":"Bolea","id":"38270598100"},{"name":"Jordi P\u00e9rez-Romero","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications (TSC), Universitat Polit\u00e9cnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Jordi","lastName":"P\u00e9rez-Romero","id":"38276873900"},{"name":"Ramon Agust\u00ed","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications (TSC), Universitat Polit\u00e9cnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Ramon","lastName":"Agust\u00ed","id":"37268326200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-908849-25-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1786-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-2-908849-26-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1882-5621"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1347-6890"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1347-6890"}],"articleNumber":"6081519","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Shadow mapping","Context","Antenna radiation patterns","Estimation","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","cognitive radio","feature extraction","power measurement","radio transmitters","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["received signal interpolation","context discovery","cognitive radio","context acquisition","primary network","power measurement","sensor network","natural neighbor","linear interpolation","nearest neighbor interpolation","feature extraction","transmitter position","antenna pattern","propagation model","correlated shadowing","noncorrelated shadowing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dynamic spectrum access","radio environment map","interpolation","nearest neighbor","natural neighbor"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the context acquisition to characterize different features of a primary network based on the power measurements obtained by a sensor network.

The estimates are based on the field trial results of 16 QAM and 1.28 MHz bandwidth. The estimation results show that wider signal bandwidth yields narrower coverage area. When the signal bandwidths are 10 MHz and 20 MHz, the coverage areas of 64 QAM are significantly shrunk to only 8% and 4% of the field trial area, respectively. One solution to the above coverage issue is a heterogeneous wireless network such as a combination of MBWA and wireless local area network (WLAN).","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 The 14th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6068193/6081449/06081530.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 The 14th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081449","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coverage estimation of uplink 64 QAM signal up to 20 MHz bandwidth based on field trial results: coverage issue of broadband uplink signal","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Bandwidth","Power generation","Throughput","Wireless communication","Broadband communication","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coverage estimation","uplink 64 QAM signal","broadband uplink signal","mobile broadband wireless access","low latency access","seamless handoff orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wireless local area network","frequency 20 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MBWA","Field trial","Heterogeneous wireless network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Coverage estimation of uplink 64 QAM signal up to 20 MHz bandwidth based on field trial results: coverage issue of broadband uplink signal","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081530/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386923","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coverage estimation of uplink 64 QAM signal up to 20 MHz bandwidth based on field trial results: coverage issue of broadband uplink signal","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1569460195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064539S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6068193","isNumber":"6081449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6068193","xplore-issue":"6081449","articleId":"6081530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"National Institute of Inform","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6081531,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Shehada","affiliation":["Ubiquitous Networking Research Group, DOCOMO Euro Laboratories, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Shehada","id":"38230153000"},{"name":"Srisakul Thakolsri","affiliation":["Ubiquitous Networking Research Group, DOCOMO Euro Laboratories, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Srisakul","lastName":"Thakolsri","id":"37545476300"},{"name":"Zoran Despotovic","affiliation":["Ubiquitous Networking Research Group, DOCOMO Euro Laboratories, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Zoran","lastName":"Despotovic","id":"37391162800"},{"name":"Wolfgang Kellerer","affiliation":["Ubiquitous Networking Research Group, DOCOMO Euro Laboratories, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Kellerer","id":"37284725800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-908849-25-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1786-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-2-908849-26-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1882-5621"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1347-6890"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1347-6890"}],"articleNumber":"6081531","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":836},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Resource management","Wireless communication","Bandwidth","Adaptation models","Optimized production technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","video communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoE","cross layer optimization","video delivery","long term evolution mobile networks","quality of experience","LTE mobile network","objective function","network operator","average video quality","mean opinion score","application layer rate adaptation","nonoptimized LTE system","OPNET LTE simulator"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we apply a Quality of Experience (QoE) based Cross-Layer Optimization (CLO) framework for efficiently allocating the network resources for video delivery in LTE mobile networks.

We extend the conventional objective function by a new constraint that allows the network operator to set its policy to provide the video service with a target average video quality. The Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is used to indicate the user satisfaction of the video service. A comparison between our approach, an Application-Layer Rate Adaptation (ALRA) and a non-optimized LTE system is done by performing simulations using an OPNET LTE simulator.

This in turn improves data hiding capacity according to Shannon's channel capacity theorem. On the other hand, with the increase of embedding power/strength for multiple bits hiding on a set of host samples, both the watermark and interference power increase. Consequently, watermark-to-(interference plus noise) power ratio (WINR) and therefore the data hiding rates saturate at a constant value. As a matter of fact, adaptive watermark power allocation in distortion constrained scenario becomes important to improve overall data hiding capacity. This paper proposes an adaptive power allocation algorithm for multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) watermarking system that simultaneously supports variable embedding rate. Implementation is done by allocating all host samples to high priority watermark bits and alternate odd and even host samples are assigned to the low priority hidden bits. The use of alternate host samples suggests to split spreading codes in odd and even parts that lead to an increase in watermark payload. An optimal watermark power allocation algorithm then maximizes the sum capacity that not only improves overall data hiding rate but also assures that each host sample can achieve a required data hiding rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 The 14th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications

In this context, several measurement campaigns have been conducted mostly in USA and Europe. This paper reports the spectrum occupancy measurements conducted in the frequency band from 700 MHz to 2700 MHz in an outdoor environment in the suburban of Mumbai, India. The measurement results of two weekdays campaign shows considerably low occupation with great potential for dynamic usage of spectrum.

Trellis shaping (TS) is an effective method to reduce PAPR without signal distortion. Several metrics are developed for TS to achieve efficient PAPR reduction in the literature. In many practical OFDM systems, however, slight peak clipping at PA is acceptable. This causes nonlinear distortion that may degrade bit error rate (BER) performance as well as yield out-of-band radiation of transmitted signal power. In this paper, we make a performance comparison of trellis-shaped OFDM systems with different metrics in terms of BER and resulting power spectrum in a practical scenario where the signal is clipped by PA.","publicationTitle":"2011 The 14th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 The 14th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6068193/6081449/06081561.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081449","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of trellis-shaped OFDM systems over nonlinear channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of trellis-shaped OFDM systems over nonlinear channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081561/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386954","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6081561/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of trellis-shaped OFDM systems over nonlinear channels","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1569461335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05253S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6068193","isNumber":"6081449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6068193","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6081449","articleId":"6081561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"National Institute of Inform","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6081562,"authors":[{"name":"Soumaya Dahi","affiliation":["Mediatron, Parc Technologique des Communications de Ghazala, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Soumaya","lastName":"Dahi","id":"38230154900"},{"name":"Sami Tabbane","affiliation":["Mediatron, Parc Technologique des Communications de Ghazala, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Tabbane","id":"37282329300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-908849-25-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1786-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-2-908849-26-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1882-5621"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1347-6890"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1347-6890"}],"articleNumber":"6081562","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cognitive radio","Channel estimation","Algorithm design and analysis","Resource management","Radio access networks","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decision making","mobile radio","radio networks","radio spectrum management","telecommunication network management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio resource management","spectrum hole temporal characterization","cognitive radio network","channel selection algorithm","decision making process","mobile terminal side","spectrum efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Holding time","Handoff","Spectrum efficiency"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate a channel selection algorithm based on temporal characterization of spectrum holes.

The proposed scheme consists of the long period allocation (LPA) strategy and the short period allocation (SPA) strategy. The quasi orthogonal bandwidth is assigned to femtocell in the LPA strategy to suppress the strong interference. Aiming to balance the traffic load, the SPA strategy is adopted to flexibly coordinate the frequency resource allocation among adjacent femtocells. The optimization problem is to minimize the power consumption while users' qualities of service (QoS) requirements are satisfied. Simulation results prove that the T-ARA scheme can well react to the traffic load level of the femtocell networks, effectively reduce the outage ratio and the power consumption.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 The 14th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6068193/6081449/06081565.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 The 14th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081449","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two phases traffic aware adaptive resource allocation scheme for dense femtocell systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Bandwidth","Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Femtocell networks","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","femtocellular radio","interference (signal)","quality of service","resource allocation","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two phases traffic aware adaptive resource allocation scheme","dense femtocell systems","interfemtocell interference","dense deployed femtocell environments","long period allocation strategy","short period allocation strategy","quasi orthogonal bandwidth","LPA strategy","strong interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive Frequency Resource Allocation","Traffic-aware","QoS","LTE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081565/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A two phases traffic aware adaptive resource allocation scheme for dense femtocell systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081565/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386958","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two phases traffic aware adaptive resource allocation scheme for dense femtocell systems","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1569464643.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060598S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6068193","isNumber":"6081449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6068193","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6081449","articleId":"6081565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"National Institute of Inform","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6081603,"authors":[{"name":"Hirokazu Nakazawa","affiliation":["Integrated Circuit and Sensor System Group, Toyohashi University of Technology, Toyohashi, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirokazu","lastName":"Nakazawa","id":"37950282100"},{"name":"Makoto Ishida","affiliation":["Integrated Circuit and Sensor System Group, Toyohashi University of Technology, Toyohashi, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Ishida","id":"37277543400"},{"name":"Kazuaki Sawada","affiliation":["Integrated Circuit and Sensor System Group, Toyohashi University of Technology, Toyohashi, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuaki","lastName":"Sawada","id":"37277567600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0170-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0171-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0169-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-8432"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8440"}],"articleNumber":"6081603","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":113},"abstract":"We developed a multimodal sensor for proton (pH, power of Hydrogen) and filter-less fluorescence imaging by using CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) silicon integrated circuit technology.

These strategies can increase parallelism and reduce the cycles efficiently. Besides, this design can support full modes, which guarantees the encoding performance.

As technology scales down, the leakage power of present SRAM based cache gradually dominates the on-chip power consumption, which can severely jeopardize system performance. The emerging nonvolatile Spin Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM) is a promising candidate for large on-chip cache because of the ultra low leakage power. However, the write operations on STT-RAM suffer from considerably higher energy as well as longer latency compared with SRAM which will make STT-RAM in trouble for write-intensive workloads. In this paper, we propose to integrate SRAM with STT-RAM to construct a novel hybrid cache architecture for CMPs. We also propose dedicated microarchitectural mechanisms to make the hybrid cache robust to workloads with different write patterns. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid scheme is adaptive to variations of workloads. Overall power consumption is reduced by 37.1% and performance is improved by 23.6% on average compared with SRAM based static NUCA under the same area configuration.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081592","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/IFIP 19th International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/IFIP 19th International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069623/6081592/06081626.pdf","doi":"10.1109/VLSISoC.2011.6081626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISoC.2011.6081626","startPage":"31","endPage":"36","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"STT-RAM based energy-efficiency hybrid cache for CMPs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081626/","displayDocTitle":"STT-RAM based energy-efficiency hybrid cache for CMPs","htmlLink":"/document/6081626/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12377333","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"STT-RAM based energy-efficiency hybrid cache for CMPs","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.793351S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069623","isNumber":"6081592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069623","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6081592","articleId":"6081626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6081627,"authors":[{"name":"W.

A number of non-volatile storage technologies such as FeRAM, MRAM, PCRAM and RRAM and so on, are under investigation to bring the non-volatility into the logic circuits and then eliminate completely the standby power issue. Thanks to its infinite endurance, high switching/sensing speed and easy 3D integration after CMOS process, MRAM is considered as the most promising one. Numerous logic circuits based on MRAM technology have been proposed and prototyped in the last years. In this paper, we present an overview and current status of these logic circuits and discuss their potential applications in the future from both the physics and architecture points of view.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/IFIP 19th International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/IFIP 19th International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069623/6081592/06081627.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISoC.2011.6081627","doi":"10.1109/VLSISoC.2011.6081627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded MRAM for high-speed computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Embedded MRAM for high-speed computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081627/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6081627/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377334","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded MRAM for high-speed computing","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.142092S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069623","isNumber":"6081592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069623","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6081592","articleId":"6081627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6081630,"authors":[{"name":"Jamshaid Sarwar Malik","affiliation":["School of ICT, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Sweden"],"firstName":"Jamshaid Sarwar","lastName":"Malik","id":"37410860700"},{"name":"Jameel Nawaz Malik","affiliation":["SEECS, National University of Sciences &Technology, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Jameel Nawaz","lastName":"Malik","id":"38242400500"},{"name":"Ahmed Hemani","affiliation":["School of ICT, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Sweden"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Hemani","id":"37265609900"},{"name":"N.D.

CLT, although very simple to implement, is never used to generate high quality Gaussian numbers. This is due to the fact that direct implementation of CLT provides very poor accuracy in tail regions of the probability density function. In this work, we have shown that it is possible to achieve high tail accuracy by empirically computing the error in CLT, which can be compensated with a simple correction algorithm. The error has been modeled as first degree piece-wise polynomial approximation, using a novel non-uniform segmentation algorithm to compute the coefficients of polynomial segments. A novel hardware architecture of GRN generator is presented which requires only 420 slices and 1 DSP block of Xilinx Virtex-4 XC4VLX15 operating at 220 MHz. This resource utilization is better than any of the previously reported designs. Demonstrated for the tail accuracy of 6\u03c3, the GRN generator design is scalable to achieve even higher accuracy with minimal increase in hardware resources. The accuracy of GRN generator is validated using statistical goodness of fit tests.","doi":"10.1109/VLSISoC.2011.6081630","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/IFIP 19th International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/IFIP 19th International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069623/6081592/06081630.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISoC.2011.6081630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081592","startPage":"60","endPage":"65","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generating high tail accuracy Gaussian Random Numbers in hardware using central limit theorem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081630","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generating high tail accuracy Gaussian Random Numbers in hardware using central limit theorem","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081630/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377337","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6081630/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generating high tail accuracy Gaussian Random Numbers in hardware using central limit theorem","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094239S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069623","isNumber":"6081592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069623","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6081592","articleId":"6081630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6081631,"authors":[{"name":"Aung Myat Thu Linn","affiliation":["VIRTUS IC Design Centre of Excellence, School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Aung Myat Thu Linn","id":"38229947200"},{"name":"Do Anh Tuan","affiliation":["VIRTUS IC Design Centre of Excellence, School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Do Anh Tuan","id":"38242161400"},{"name":"Chen Shoushun","affiliation":["VIRTUS IC Design Centre of Excellence, School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Chen Shoushun","id":"37294458700"},{"name":"Yeo Kiat Seng","affiliation":["VIRTUS IC Design Centre of Excellence, School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yeo Kiat Seng","id":"37297185800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0170-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0171-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0169-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-8432"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8440"}],"articleNumber":"6081631","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":435},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Simulation","Logic gates","Arrays","Image sensors","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","jitter","readout electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive priority toggle asynchronous tree arbiter","AER-based image sensor","address event representation","event latency","event-triggered pixels","timing error","jitter","bus resource","CMOS process","silicon area","AER temporal contrast sensor","size 0.35 mum"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we reported an adaptive priority toggle asynchronous tree arbiter for Address Event Representation (AER)-based image sensors. Simultaneous requests from event-triggered pixels, event latency, timing error and jitter are the inherent issues in AER-based read-out circuits. Fixed priority arbiter often results in unfair allocation of bus resource to only \u201cprivileged\u201d pixels thus resulting in timing error. The proposed arbiter is able to reduce the timing error by toggling the requests priority during simultaneous requests. This also achieves the fair allocation of bus resource to all pixels. The featured eager propagation scheme allows the requests to propagate towards higher hierarchy in the tree during the arbitration process. As a result, latency and jitter problems can be reduced. Simulation result reveals that single event delay for 128-way tree arbiter is 4.2 ns and therefore, for 128 \u00d7 128 array, such arbiter can process up to 238.09M event/s which is more than 15 times faster than the speed of the reported AER sensor.

In this paper, we propose and evaluate a possible layout for an optical Network-on-Chip used to interconnect processing elements located on different electrical layers.","doi":"10.1109/VLSISoC.2011.6081645","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/IFIP 19th International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/IFIP 19th International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069623/6081592/06081645.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISoC.2011.6081645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081592","startPage":"242","endPage":"247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layout guidelines for 3D architectures including Optical Ring Network-on-Chip (ORNoC)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Layout guidelines for 3D architectures including Optical Ring Network-on-Chip (ORNoC)","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081645/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377352","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6081645/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layout guidelines for 3D architectures including Optical Ring Network-on-Chip (ORNoC)","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"83.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060715S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069623","isNumber":"6081592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069623","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6081592","articleId":"6081645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6081647,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Ming","affiliation":["Microelectronics Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Zhu Ming","id":"38000872800"},{"name":"Xiao Li Yi","affiliation":["Microelectronics Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Xiao Li Yi","id":"38005966700"},{"name":"Luo Hong Wei","affiliation":["Reliability Physics and Application Technology of Electrical Component, National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Luo Hong Wei","id":"38236742400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0170-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0171-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0169-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-8432"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8440"}],"articleNumber":"6081647","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":566},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Mathematical model","Equations","Reliability","Decoding","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","storage management chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SEC-DED-DAEC codes","multiple bit upsets mitigation","MBU","single error correction codes","double error detection codes","double-adjacent-error-correction codes","noise source","memory system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["memory","memory reliability","SEC-DED-DAEC codes","MBUs"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays, multiple bit upsets (MBUs) have been widely investigated in memories. Conventional single error correction and double error detection (SEC-DED) codes are capable of correcting one error and detecting all possible double errors. However, they may not provide adequate protection against MBUs. This paper proposes new single-error-correction, double-error-detection double-adjacent-error-correction (SEC-DED-DAEC) codes to mitigate radiation or noise source induced MBUs in memories. The proposed SEC-DED-DAEC codes are obtained from conventional SEC-DED codes according to the mathematics model established in this paper. They can detect and correct all adjacent double bit errors and assure a lower miscorrection probability for non-adjacent double bit errors compared with other SEC-DED-DAEC codes. Furthermore, the redundancy bits of the proposed scheme are the same as those of conventional SEC-DED codes. This means that the increase of correct-capability do not cause additional hardware overhead for the memory system. Finally, the experiment results reveal that the proposed scheme reduces the miscorrection probability of non-adjacent double bit errors by 12% compared to the best known SEC-DED-DAEC codes. Moreover, compared to the well known BCH codes, the proposed scheme reduces 40% hardware redundancy and keeps an acceptable reliability.","doi":"10.1109/VLSISoC.2011.6081647","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/IFIP 19th International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/IFIP 19th International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069623/6081592/06081647.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISoC.2011.6081647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New SEC-DED-DAEC codes for multiple bit upsets mitigation in memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081647/","displayDocTitle":"New SEC-DED-DAEC codes for multiple bit upsets mitigation in memory","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377354","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081647/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New SEC-DED-DAEC codes for multiple bit upsets mitigation in memory","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06888S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069623","isNumber":"6081592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069623","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6081592","articleId":"6081647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6081648,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China","Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38067939100"},{"name":"Le Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China","Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Le Yu","id":"38237630800"},{"name":"Haigang Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Haigang Yang","id":"37291236200"},{"name":"Y.

Further a recovery mechanism for such a TSV array is introduced to enhance the TSV reliability. Test results will be configured to the TSV chain circuits by the central control logic and be used to determine the connection jumping between signal and redundant TSVs. This way, the failure TSVs could be replaced by the redundant ones. Simulation results demonstrate that the self-test circuit and central control logic could detect and recover the broken TSVs correctly. Moreover, the efficiency and area cost of the recovery mechanism is discussed, and it turns out that in a typical case of 96 signal TSVs, the chip yield could reach 90% with TSV failure rate equal to 5%, in exchange for less than 4% area cost of self-test circuit in the whole TSV area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6081648/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12377355","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Self-test method and recovery mechanism for high frequency TSV array","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-test method and recovery mechanism for high frequency TSV array","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"92.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043624S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069623","isNumber":"6081592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069623","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6081592","articleId":"6081648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6081652,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Yuan Jheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, R.O.C, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hong-Yuan Jheng","id":"38196243000"},{"name":"Yen-Hsiang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, R.O.C, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Hsiang Chen","id":"37579128100"},{"name":"Shanq-Jang Ruan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, R.O.C, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shanq-Jang Ruan","id":"37394866900"},{"name":"Ziming Qi","affiliation":["Auckland Institute of Smart Technology, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Ziming","lastName":"Qi","id":"38184490800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0170-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0171-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0169-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-8432"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8440"}],"articleNumber":"6081652","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Matrix decomposition","Real time systems","Pipelines","Field programmable gate arrays","Art","Navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","field programmable gate arrays","signal denoising","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","high sampling rate in-car non-stationary noise cancellation","real-time adaptive Wiener filter","Xilinx Virtex-5 chip","time 918 mus","frequency 88.6 kHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081652","abstract":"This paper presents the architecture and implementation of a real-time adaptive Wiener filter for non-stationary noise cancellation in a car environment.

As a result, quest for novel physical media for storage and computing is currently an important research pursuit. Recently a new kind of passive electrical device called memristor is proposed, which can retain its state via the resistance in a non-volatile fashion. It is also experimentally demonstrated to perform material implication, a fundamental logical operation. The capability of a memristive device to do logical operations as well as to retain its state makes it a promising candidate for future technologies.

A fine-grained fault model is first introduced. Different from the traditional link or node NoC fault models which assume the faulty resource to be totally unfunctional, we distinguish the faulty components and handle them according to their fault classes. By doing so, we can avoid unnecessary partitioning of the network and hence achieve a higher connectivity under high fault rate. Two new dynamic reconfiguration schemes at the router level, namely Dynamic Buffer Swapping (DBS) and Dynamic MUX Swapping(DMS), are proposed to deal with the buffer and cross-bar faults accordingly, which are the main sources of failure in the router. In these schemes, the healthy resources in the router are maximally utilized to mitigate the faults. Experimental results show that we can achieve higher packet acceptance rate and lower latency compared with state-of-the-art fault-tolerant routing schemes.","doi":"10.1109/VLSISoC.2011.6081674","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/IFIP 19th International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/IFIP 19th International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069623/6081592/06081674.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISoC.2011.6081674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fault-tolerant network-on-chip design using dynamic reconfiguration of partial-faulty routing resources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081674/","displayDocTitle":"A fault-tolerant network-on-chip design using dynamic reconfiguration of partial-faulty routing resources","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377381","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081674/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fault-tolerant network-on-chip design using dynamic reconfiguration of partial-faulty routing resources","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"P29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053399S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069623","isNumber":"6081592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069623","xplore-issue":"6081592","articleId":"6081674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6081676,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Long Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Long","lastName":"Fan","id":"37392424800"},{"name":"Vita Pi-Ho Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Vita Pi-Ho","lastName":"Hu","id":"37391915700"},{"name":"Yin-Nien Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yin-Nien","lastName":"Chen","id":"38026283000"},{"name":"Pin Su","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pin","lastName":"Su","id":"37286925700"},{"name":"Ching-Te Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Te","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37268438500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-760-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-761-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-759-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1078-621X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1078-621X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1078-621X"}],"articleNumber":"6081676","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":543},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","FinFETs","Random access memory","Electron traps","Stability analysis","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit stability","integrated circuit noise","MOSFET","random noise","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single trap induced random telegraph noise","FinFET devices","FinFETSRAM cell stability","tied-gate mode","sidewall channel","independent-gate mode","current conduction path","fin line edge roughness","work function variation","single charged trap","cell transistor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081676","abstract":"In this work, we investigate, for the first time, the impacts of single trap induced Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) on the drain current of FinFET devices and the stability of FinFET 6T SRAM cell.

While a wide variety of sequence representations exist, lack of a generic implementation of efficient sequence storage has led to a plethora of poorly reusable or programming language- specific implementations. We present a novel, space-efficient data structure (GtEncseq) for storing multiple biological sequences of variable alphabet size, with customizable character transformations, wildcard support, and an assortment of internal representations optimized for different distributions of wildcards and sequence lengths. For the human genome (3.1 gigabases, including 237 million wildcard characters) our representation requires only 2 + 8 \u00b7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n bits per character. Implemented in C, our portable software implementation provides a variety of methods for random and sequential access to characters and substrings (including different reading directions) using an object-oriented interface. In addition, it includes access to metadata like sequence descriptions or character distributions. The library is extensible to be used from various scripting languages. GtEncseq is much more versatile than previous solutions, adding features that were previously unavailable. Benchmarks show that it is competitive with respect to space and time requirements.","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2011.146","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8857/6138579/06081847.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2011.146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6138579","startPage":"345","endPage":"357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Efficient Data Structure for Storage and Retrieval of Multiple Biosequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081847","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Efficient Data Structure for Storage and Retrieval of Multiple Biosequences","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081847/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 2012","accessionNumber":"12489699","pubMedId":"22084150","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6081847/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Efficient Data Structure for Storage and Retrieval of Multiple Biosequences","sourcePdf":"ttb2012020345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093333S","chronDate":"March-April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"6138579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6138579","articleId":"6081847","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6081853,"authors":[{"name":"Michel A.

As they are not aware of flow demands that are specific to the application, network resources can be poorly utilized and cause serious local congestion. Also, flows, or packets, may share virtual channels in an undetermined way; the effects of head-of-line blocking may result in throughput degradation. In this paper, we present a framework for application-aware routing that assures deadlock freedom under one or more virtual channels by forcing routes to conform to an acyclic channel dependence graph. In addition, we present methods to statically and efficiently allocate virtual channels to flows or packets, under oblivious routing, when there are two or more virtual channels per link. Using the application-aware routing framework, we develop and evaluate a bandwidth-sensitive oblivious routing scheme that statically determines routes considering an application's communication characteristics. Given bandwidth estimates for flows, we present a mixed integer-linear programming (MILP) approach and a heuristic approach for producing deadlock-free routes that minimize maximum channel load. Our framework can be used to produce application-aware routes that target the minimization of latency, number of flows through a link, bandwidth, or any combination thereof. Our results show that it is possible to achieve better performance than traditional deterministic and oblivious routing schemes on popular synthetic benchmarks using our bandwidth-sensitive approach. We also show that, when oblivious routing is used and there are more flows than virtual channels per link, the static assignment of virtual channels to flows can help mitigate the effects of head-of-line blocking, which may impede packets that are dynamically competing for virtual channels. We experimentally explore the performance tradeoffs of static and dynamic virtual channel allocation on bandwidth-sensitive and traditional oblivious routing methods.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2011.219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6363446/06081853.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2011.219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6363446","startPage":"59","endPage":"73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal and Heuristic Application-Aware Oblivious Routing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal and Heuristic Application-Aware Oblivious Routing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081853/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13146736","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal and Heuristic Application-Aware Oblivious Routing","sourcePdf":"ttc2013010059.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040824S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","isNumber":"6363446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"12","articleId":"6081853","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6081859,"authors":[{"name":"Carsten Benthin","affiliation":["Intel Visual Computing Institute, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/6238449/6081859/6081859-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Carsten Benthin received the Diploma degree in computer science and the PhD degree from Saarland University in Germany.

The two most commonly used schemes are either packet tracing, or relying on a separate traversal stack for each SIMD lane. Both work great for coherent rays, but suffer when rays are incoherent: The former experiences a dramatic loss of SIMD utilization once rays diverge; the latter requires a large local storage, and generates multiple incoherent streams of memory accesses that present challenges for the memory system. In this paper, we introduce a single-ray tracing scheme for incoherent rays that uses just one traversal stack on 16-wide SIMD hardware. It uses a bounding-volume hierarchy with a branching factor of four as the acceleration structure, exploits four-wide SIMD in each box and primitive intersection test, and uses 16-wide SIMD by always performing four such node or primitive tests in parallel. We then extend this scheme to a hybrid tracing scheme that automatically adapts to varying ray coherence by starting out with a 16-wide packet scheme and switching to the new single-ray scheme as soon as rays diverge. We show that on the Intel Many Integrated Core architecture this hybrid scheme consistently, and over a wide range of scenes and ray distributions, outperforms both packet and single-ray tracing.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6238449/06081859.pdf","startPage":"1438","endPage":"1448","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6238449","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining Single and Packet-Ray Tracing for Arbitrary Ray Distributions on the Intel MIC Architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Vectors","Ray tracing","Registers","Memory management","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet-ray tracing","arbitrary ray distributions","Intel MIC architecture","traversal stack","SIMD lane","SIMD utilization","multiple incoherent streams","memory accesses","single-ray tracing scheme","16-wide SIMD hardware","bounding-volume hierarchy","branching factor","primitive intersection test","hybrid tracing scheme","Intel many integrated core architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ray tracing","SIMD processors."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081859/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Combining Single and Packet-Ray Tracing for Arbitrary Ray Distributions on the Intel MIC Architecture","volume":"18","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6081859/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12853237","pubMedId":"22084142","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining Single and Packet-Ray Tracing for Arbitrary Ray Distributions on the Intel MIC Architecture","sourcePdf":"ttg2012091438.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080724S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6238449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6238449","articleId":"6081859","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6081863,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Jin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, 2132 Siebel Center, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Xin Jin received the diploma in physics at Beijing Normal University, China, in 2005 and the diploma and MS degrees in computer science at Beijing Normal University, China, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

Popular Internet commerce websites such as Amazon.com are also furnished with tremendous amounts of product-related images. In addition, images in such social networks are also accompanied by annotations, comments, and other information, thus forming heterogeneous image-rich information networks. In this paper, we introduce the concept of (heterogeneous) image-rich information network and the problem of how to perform information retrieval and recommendation in such networks. We propose a fast algorithm heterogeneous minimum order k-SimRank (HMok-SimRank) to compute link-based similarity in weighted heterogeneous information networks. Then, we propose an algorithm Integrated Weighted Similarity Learning (IWSL) to account for both link-based and content-based similarities by considering the network structure and mutually reinforcing link similarity and feature weight learning. Both local and global feature learning methods are designed. Experimental results on Flickr and Amazon data sets show that our approach is significantly better than traditional methods in terms of both relevance and speed. A new product search and recommendation system for e-commerce has been implemented based on our algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2011.228","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/6389669/06081863.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2011.228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6389669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforced Similarity Integration in Image-Rich Information Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081863/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Reinforced Similarity Integration in Image-Rich Information Networks","volume":"25","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13188791","htmlLink":"/document/6081863/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforced Similarity Integration in Image-Rich Information Networks","sourcePdf":"ttk2013020448.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115235S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6389669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6389669","articleId":"6081863","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6081868,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Cagliero","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/6419729/6081868/6081868-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luca Cagliero received the master\u2019s degree in computer and communication networks from Politecnico di Torino.

The steadfast evolution of markets and business environments prompts the need of data mining algorithms to discover significant correlation changes in order to reactively suit product and service provision to customer needs. Change mining, in the context of frequent itemsets, focuses on detecting and reporting significant changes in the set of mined itemsets from one time period to another. The discovery of frequent generalized itemsets, i.e., itemsets that 1) frequently occur in the source data, and 2) provide a high-level abstraction of the mined knowledge, issues new challenges in the analysis of itemsets that become rare, and thus are no longer extracted, from a certain point. This paper proposes a novel kind of dynamic pattern, namely the History GENeralized Pattern (HIGEN), that represents the evolution of an itemset in consecutive time periods, by reporting the information about its frequent generalizations characterized by minimal redundancy (i.e., minimum level of abstraction) in case it becomes infrequent in a certain time period. To address HIGEN mining, it proposes HIGEN MINER, an algorithm that focuses on avoiding itemset mining followed by postprocessing by exploiting a support-driven itemset generalization approach. To focus the attention on the minimally redundant frequent generalizations and thus reduce the amount of the generated patterns, the discovery of a smart subset of HIGENs, namely the NONREDUNDANT HIGENs, is addressed as well. Experiments performed on both real and synthetic datasets show the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed approach as well as its usefulness in a real application context.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081868/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13251872","volume":"25","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6081868/","publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Discovering Temporal Change Patterns in the Presence of Taxonomies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discovering Temporal Change Patterns in the Presence of Taxonomies","sourcePdf":"ttk2013030541.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085157S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6419729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6419729","articleId":"6081868","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6081872,"authors":[{"name":"Rohan Murty","affiliation":["CSAIL, The Stata Center, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6111374/6081872/6081872-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rohan Murty received the BS degree in computer science in 2005 from Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, and the PhD degree in computer science in 2011 from Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

While the ruling provides broad guidelines for the database, the specifics of its design, features, implementation, and use are yet to be determined. Furthermore, architecting a network where all WSDs rely on the database raises several systems and networking challenges that have remained unexplored. Also, the ruling treats the database only as a storehouse for incumbents. We believe that the mandated use of the database has an additional opportunity: a means to dynamically manage the RF spectrum. Motivated by this opportunity, in this paper, we present SenseLess, a database-driven white spaces network. As suggested by its very name, in SenseLess, WSDs rely on a database service to determine white spaces availability as opposed to spectrum sensing. The service, using a combination of an up-to-date database of incumbents, sophisticated signal propagation modeling, and an efficient content dissemination mechanism to ensure efficient, scalable, and safe white space network operation. We build, deploy, and evaluate SenseLess and compare our results to ground truth spectrum measurements. We present the unique system design considerations that arise due to operating over the white spaces. We also evaluate its efficiency and scalability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that identifies and examines the systems and networking challenges that arise from operating a white space network, which is solely dependent on a channel occupancy database.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6111374/06081872.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"203","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6111374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SenseLess: A Database-Driven White Spaces Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["White spaces","FCC","Computational modeling","Database systems","Mobile computing","Transmitters","TV","Government policies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database management systems","radio networks","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SenseLess database-driven white spaces network","white space device","RF spectrum management","database service","spectrum sensing","signal propagation modeling","content dissemination mechanism","channel occupancy database","FCC ruling","ground truth spectrum measurements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networking","wireless","white spaces","mobile computing."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"SenseLess: A Database-Driven White Spaces Network","volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6081872/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425823","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SenseLess: A Database-Driven White Spaces Network","sourcePdf":"ttm2012020189.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130078S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6111374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"155","xplore-issue":"6111374","articleId":"6081872","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6081874,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.M.

However, the popular location fingerprint, Received Signal Strength (RSS), is observed to differ significantly across different devices' hardware even under the same wireless conditions. We derive analytically a robust location fingerprint definition, the Signal Strength Difference (SSD), and verify its performance experimentally using a number of different mobile devices with heterogeneous hardware. Our experiments have also considered both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices, as well as both Access-Point(AP)-based localization and Mobile-Node (MN)-assisted localization. We present the results of two well-known localization algorithms (K Nearest Neighbor and Bayesian Inference) when our proposed fingerprint is used, and demonstrate its robustness when the testing device differs from the training device. We also compare these SSD-based localization algorithms' performance against that of two other approaches in the literature that are designed to mitigate the effects of mobile node hardware variations, and show that SSD-based algorithms have better accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SSD: A Robust RF Location Fingerprint Addressing Mobile Devices' Heterogeneity","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.243","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6355922/06081874.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6355922","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081874","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081874/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"SSD: A Robust RF Location Fingerprint Addressing Mobile Devices' Heterogeneity","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6081874/","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13146510","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SSD: A Robust RF Location Fingerprint Addressing Mobile Devices' Heterogeneity","sourcePdf":"ttm2013010065.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103498S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6355922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"6355922","articleId":"6081874","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6081875,"authors":[{"name":"Udo Schilcher","affiliation":["Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems, University of Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt am Worthersee, Austria"],"firstName":"Udo","lastName":"Schilcher","id":"37392192300"},{"name":"Christian Bettstetter","affiliation":["Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems, University of Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt am Worthersee, Austria"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Bettstetter","id":"37265503000"},{"name":"G\u00fcnther Brandner","affiliation":["Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems, University of Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt am Worthersee, Austria"],"firstName":"G\u00fcnther","lastName":"Brandner","id":"37392191800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0660"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9875"}],"articleNumber":"6081875","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1122},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081875","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading channels","Interference","Rayleigh channels","Wireless networks","Random variables","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","diversity reception","radio networks","radiofrequency interference","Rayleigh channels","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference temporal correlation","wireless networks","Rayleigh block fading","protocols","wireless communications","diversity schemes","correlation-node locations","assumptions-random homogeneous node positions","ALOHA traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless networks","interference","correlation","Rayleigh fading","spatial stochastics","time diversity"]}],"abstract":"The temporal correlation of interference is a key performance factor of several technologies and protocols for wireless communications.

In any PKI system, the authentication of a received message is performed by checking if the certificate of the sender is included in the current CRL, and verifying the authenticity of the certificate and signature of the sender. In this paper, we propose an Expedite Message Authentication Protocol (EMAP) for VANETs, which replaces the time-consuming CRL checking process by an efficient revocation checking process. The revocation check process in EMAP uses a keyed Hash Message Authentication Code ({HMAC}), where the key used in calculating the {HMAC} is shared only between nonrevoked On-Board Units (OBUs). In addition, EMAP uses a novel probabilistic key distribution, which enables nonrevoked OBUs to securely share and update a secret key. EMAP can significantly decrease the message loss ratio due to the message verification delay compared with the conventional authentication methods employing CRL. By conducting security analysis and performance evaluation, EMAP is demonstrated to be secure and efficient.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.246","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6355922/06081877.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6355922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.246","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","startPage":"78","endPage":"89","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EMAP: Expedite Message Authentication Protocol for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"EMAP: Expedite Message Authentication Protocol for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081877/","volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6081877/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13136686","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EMAP: Expedite Message Authentication Protocol for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2013010078.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100835S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6355922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"6355922","articleId":"6081877","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6081878,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Calonder","affiliation":["I&C Faculty, Computer Vision Laboratory, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6200921/6081878/6081878-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Calonder received the PhD degree in computer vision from the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, in 2010.

The typical approach to creating them is to first compute floating-point ones, using an algorithm such as SIFT, and then to binarize them. In this paper, we show that we can directly compute a binary descriptor, which we call BRIEF, on the basis of simple intensity difference tests. As a result, BRIEF is very fast both to build and to match. We compare it against SURF and SIFT on standard benchmarks and show that it yields comparable recognition accuracy, while running in an almost vanishing fraction of the time required by either.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6200921/06081878.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6200921","startPage":"1281","endPage":"1298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BRIEF: Computing a Local Binary Descriptor Very Fast","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"BRIEF: Computing a Local Binary Descriptor Very Fast","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081878/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"34","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12728254","pubMedId":"22084141","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6081878/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BRIEF: Computing a Local Binary Descriptor Very Fast","sourcePdf":"ttp2012071281.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078697S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6200921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"473","xplore-issue":"6200921","articleId":"6081878","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6081880,"authors":[{"name":"Guoxing Zhan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/6134781/6081880/6081880-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guoxing Zhan received the MS degree in mathematics from Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2007 and another MS degree in computer science from Wayne State University in 2009.

An adversary can exploit this defect to launch various harmful or even devastating attacks against the routing protocols, including sinkhole attacks, wormhole attacks, and Sybil attacks. The situation is further aggravated by mobile and harsh network conditions. Traditional cryptographic techniques or efforts at developing trust-aware routing protocols do not effectively address this severe problem. To secure the WSNs against adversaries misdirecting the multihop routing, we have designed and implemented TARF, a robust trust-aware routing framework for dynamic WSNs. Without tight time synchronization or known geographic information, TARF provides trustworthy and energy-efficient route. Most importantly, TARF proves effective against those harmful attacks developed out of identity deception; the resilience of TARF is verified through extensive evaluation with both simulation and empirical experiments on large-scale WSNs under various scenarios including mobile and RF-shielding network conditions. Further, we have implemented a low-overhead TARF module in TinyOS; as demonstrated, this implementation can be incorporated into existing routing protocols with the least effort. Based on TARF, we also demonstrated a proof-of-concept mobile target detection application that functions well against an antidetection mechanism.","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2011.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6134781","startPage":"184","endPage":"197","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/6134781/06081880.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE

The focus is package internal thermal management. A carbon fiber-reinforced carbon composite- (C/C composite) based heat sink is proposed as a means of enhancement over the more conventional CuMo material. The C/C composite has anisotropic thermal properties. Thermal performance of the material with anisotropic thermal properties depends strongly on taking advantage of superior properties in the desired directions. Finite-element analysis is performed to determine the correct orientation of the C/C composite material with anisotropic thermal conductivities to minimize thermal resistance. A 32% reduction in thermal resistance of the HPA has been predicted in the initial simulation. A package incorporating the C/C composite material is built with the optimal orientation of thermal anisotropy obtained by numerical simulations. A 20% reduction in thermal resistance has been successfully obtained by surface temperature measurements for the HPA with the C/C composite material. The difference between numerical (32%) and experimental results (20%) is well explained by the difference in boundary conditions at the package base. Also, nonlinearity in thermal resistance is explained by taking account of temperature dependence of semiconductor materials, such as SiC and GaN.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6130614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2011.2169673","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503870/6130614/06081915.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"101","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2011.2169673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of Thermal Resistance of High-Power Amplifiers by Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Carbon Composite-Based Package","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Thermal Resistance of High-Power Amplifiers by Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Carbon Composite-Based Package","volume":"2","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6081915/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471867","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081915/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Thermal Resistance of High-Power Amplifiers by Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Carbon Composite-Based Package","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-wakejima-2169673-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064534S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"6130614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6130614","articleId":"6081915","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6081922,"authors":[{"name":"Igor S.

The algorithm gives the initial parameters by the clustering algorithm and then updates them with a combination of backpropagation and recursive least-squares methods. The parameters are updated in the direction of steepest descent but with a local adaptive learning rate that is different for each epoch and only depends on the sign of the gradient error function. This adaptive learning rate is chosen, such as to accelerate convergence. The learning algorithm is inspired from the halving method to find polynomials roots. Even though the results are quite satisfactory, the algorithm is much simpler than others that have been reported. In addition, it does includes no excessive terms in adapting formulation, unlike much of the research in this area. Furthermore, this algorithm somewhat increases accuracy, while using far fewer parameters.

A sliding-mode observer is designed to estimate the rotor position of the PMG by using the measured stator currents and the commanded stator voltages obtained from the control scheme of the machine-side converter of the PMG wind turbine. The rotor speed of the PMG (i.e., the turbine shaft speed) is estimated from its back electromotive force using a model adaptive reference system observer. Based on the measured output electrical power and estimated rotor speed of the PMG, the mechanical power of the turbine is estimated by taking into account the power losses of the wind turbine generator system. A back-propagation artificial neural network is then designed to estimate the wind speed in real time by using the estimated turbine shaft speed and mechanical power. The estimated wind speed is used to determine the optimal shaft speed reference for the PMG control system. Finally, a sensorless control is developed for the PMG wind turbines to continuously generate the maximum electrical power without using any wind speed or rotor position sensors. The validity of the proposed estimation and control algorithms are shown by simulation studies on a 3-kW PMG wind turbine and are further demonstrated by experimental results on a 300-W practical PMG wind turbine.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2011.2175877","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/6132606/06081927.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2011.2175877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6132606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wind Speed and Rotor Position Sensorless Control for Direct-Drive PMG Wind Turbines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081927/","displayDocTitle":"Wind Speed and Rotor Position Sensorless Control for Direct-Drive PMG Wind Turbines","volume":"48","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12477621","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081927/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wind Speed and Rotor Position Sensorless Control for Direct-Drive PMG Wind Turbines","sourcePdf":"tia-qiao-2175877-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053643S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6132606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"6132606","articleId":"6081927","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6081929,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Kodovsky","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6166811/6081929/6081929-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jan Kodovsk\u00fd received the M.S. degree in mathematical modeling from the Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic, in 2006.

The tool of choice for the machine learning seems to be the support vector machine (SVM). In this paper, we propose an alternative and well-known machine learning tool-ensemble classifiers implemented as random forests-and argue that they are ideally suited for steganalysis. Ensemble classifiers scale much more favorably w.r.t. the number of training examples and the feature dimensionality with performance comparable to the much more complex SVMs. The significantly lower training complexity opens up the possibility for the steganalyst to work with rich (high-dimensional) cover models and train on larger training sets-two key elements that appear necessary to reliably detect modern steganographic algorithms. Ensemble classification is portrayed here as a powerful developer tool that allows fast construction of steganography detectors with markedly improved detection accuracy across a wide range of embedding methods. The power of the proposed framework is demonstrated on three steganographic methods that hide messages in JPEG images.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2011.2175919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6166811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2175919","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6166811/06081929.pdf","startPage":"432","endPage":"444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensemble Classifiers for Steganalysis of Digital Media","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Ensemble Classifiers for Steganalysis of Digital Media","volume":"7","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081929/","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12578157","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081929/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensemble Classifiers for Steganalysis of Digital Media","sourcePdf":"tifs-kodovsky-2175919-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107534S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6166811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"559","xplore-issue":"6166811","articleId":"6081929","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6081934,"authors":[{"name":"Xinpeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Communication, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xinpeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279340100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-6013"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6021"}],"articleNumber":"6081934","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":376,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":7968},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Data mining","Receivers","Image coding","Educational institutions","Fingerprint recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data encapsulation","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["separable reversible data hiding","encrypted image","uncompressed image","encryption key","data hiding key","encryption key","natural image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image encryption","image recovery","reversible data hiding"]}],"abstract":"This work proposes a novel scheme for separable reversible data hiding in encrypted images.

Gradients convey important visual information and are crucial to scene understanding. Using such information, structural and contrast changes can be effectively captured. Therefore, we use the gradient similarity to measure the change in contrast and structure in images. Apart from the structural/contrast changes, image quality is also affected by luminance changes, which must be also accounted for complete and more robust IQA. Hence, the proposed scheme considers both luminance and contrast-structural changes to effectively assess image quality. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is designed to follow the masking effect and visibility threshold more closely, i.e., the case when both masked and masking signals are small is more effectively tackled by the proposed scheme. Finally, the effects of the changes in luminance and contrast-structure are integrated via an adaptive method to obtain the overall image quality score. Extensive experiments conducted with six publicly available subject-rated databases (comprising of diverse images and distortion types) have confirmed the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of the proposed scheme in comparison with the relevant state-of-the-art schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2175935","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6170603/06081939.pdf","startPage":"1500","endPage":"1512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2175935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Quality Assessment Based on Gradient Similarity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081939/","displayDocTitle":"Image Quality Assessment Based on Gradient Similarity","volume":"21","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12615452","pubMedId":"22106145","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081939/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Quality Assessment Based on Gradient Similarity","sourcePdf":"tip-lin-2175935-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124817S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6170603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"416","xplore-issue":"6170603","articleId":"6081939","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6081940,"authors":[{"name":"David Varodayan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6183042/6081940/6081940-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David Varodayan (M'11) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.","Dr. Varodayan was a recipient of the European Association for Signal Processing (EURASIP) Signal Processing Journal's Most Cited Paper Award in 2009 and the Best Student Paper Award on two occasions: IEEE Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing in 2006 and European Signal Processing Conference in 2007."]},"firstName":"David","lastName":"Varodayan","id":"37297703600"},{"name":"Yao-Chung Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6183042/6081940/6081940-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Yao-Chung Lin (M'09) received the B.S. degree in computer science and information engineering and M.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, and the Ph.D. degree from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2010.","His research interests include distributed source coding applications, multimedia systems, and video processing and compression."]},"firstName":"Yao-Chung","lastName":"Lin","id":"37578091700"},{"name":"Bernd Girod","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6183042/6081940/6081940-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Bernd Girod (F'98) received the Engineering Doctorate from the University of Hannover, Hannover, Germany, and the M.S. degree from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta.","He has been a Professor of electrical engineering and (by courtesy) computer science in the Information Systems Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, since 1999.

The decoder uses the sum-product algorithm to simultaneously recover the source symbols and the hidden statistical dependence variables. We also develop novel techniques based on density evolution (DE) to analyze the coding algorithms. We experimentally confirm that our DE analysis closely approximates practical performance. This result allows us to efficiently optimize parameters of the algorithms. In particular, we show that the system performs close to the Slepian-Wolf bound when an appropriate doping rate is selected.

By embedding the system in a dielectric cladding medium, we show strong sensitivities of the resonant behavior to the refractive index and thickness of the dielectric load.

In physiological studies of the brain, SP signal has been the focus. Various circuits have been reported to acquire SP signals in brain\u2013machine interface (BMI) systems over the years. Recent study shows that the LFP signal plays important roles in modulating many profound neuronal mechanisms in the brain. It is important for new BMI design to record the dual-band signal accurately, which demands acquisition circuits to have low noise and good linearity in both bands. In this paper, we report the design of a dual-band acquisition integrated circuit (IC) for microelectrode recording. The novel design uses a continuous- time (CT) front-end with chopping to suppress the noise, and a discrete-time (DT) back-end to achieve good linearity. A prototype monolithic acquisition IC is fabricated in a 0.35 \n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu{\\rm m}$</tex></formula>\n CMOS process. It has 16 acquisition channels and an 11 bit successive-approximation (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Silicon measurements show that every channel has \n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$29.2\\,{\\rm nV}/{\\rm Hz}^{0.5}$</tex></formula>\n noise and \n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">${&lt;}0.1\\%$</tex></formula>\n nonlinearity. The good linearity effectively prevents the aliasing and mixing between the two bands. For LFP signals, the recording noise is \n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$0.9\\,{\\mu}{\\rm V}_{\\rm rms}$</tex></formula>\n. For SP signals, the recording noise is \n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$2.9\\,{\\mu}{\\rm V}_{\\rm rms}$</tex></formula>\n.

An asymmetric 2T gain cell utilizes the gate and junction leakages of a PMOS write device to maintain a high data `1' voltage level which enables fast read access using an NMOS read device. A current-mode sense amplifier (C-S/A) featuring a cross-coupled PMOS latch and pseudo-PMOS diode pairs is proposed to overcome the innate problem of small read bit-line (RBL) voltage swing in 2T eDRAMs with improved voltage headroom and better impedance matching under process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations. A half-swing write bit-line (WBL) scheme is adopted to improve the WBL speed by 33% and reduce its power dissipation by 25% during write-back operation with no effect on retention time. A stepped write word-line (WWL) driver reduces the current drawn from the boosted high and low supplies by 67%.

This study exploits to what degree the spectral anisotropy contained in the data can contribute to a more robust retrieval of chlorophyll and leaf area index of cotton compared to retrievals based on single angle observations. To do so, a simplified automated radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion scheme was applied both to the single observation angles and to various combinations of multiple view angles. It is shown that significant increase in accuracy is obtained when directional information is included. However, the improvement obtained by assimilating a certain observation angle appears to be strongly related to the ability of the RTM in reconstructing canopy reflectance for this constellation. Hence, due to the deficiency of the 1-D RTM to reconstruct observed reflectance for the row crop in the extreme forward looking direction, the result strongly deteriorated when this view angle was included.

Due to the high dimensionality of the hyperspectral data, spectral unmixing is a very time-consuming task. With recent advances in reconfigurable computing, especially using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), hyperspectral image processing algorithms can now be accelerated for on-board exploitation using compact hardware components with small size and cost. Although in previous work several efforts have been directed towards FPGA implementation of endmember extraction algorithms, the abundance estimation step has received comparatively much less attention. In this work, we develop a parallel FPGA-based design of the image space reconstruction algorithm (ISRA), a technique for solving linear inverse problems with positive constraints that has been used to estimate the abundance of each endmember in each pixel of a hyperspectral image. It is an iterative algorithm that guarantees convergence (after a certain number of iterations) and positive values in the results of the abundances (an important consideration in unmixing applications). Our system includes a direct memory access (DMA) module and implements a pre-fetching technique to hide the latency of the input/output communications. The method has been implemented on a Virtex-4 XC4VFX60 FPGA (a model that is similar to radiation-hardened FPGAs certified for space operation) and tested using real hyperspectral data sets collected by the Airborne Visible Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over the Cuprite mining district in Nevada and the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve in California. Experimental results demonstrate that our hardware version can significantly outperform an equivalent software version, thus being able to provide abundance estimation results in near real-time, which makes our reconfigurable system appealing for on-board hyperspectral data processing.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2011.2171673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2011.2171673","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/6157671/06081957.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6157671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Abundance Estimation for Spectral Unmixing of Hyperspectral Data Using the Image Space Reconstruction Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081957/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Abundance Estimation for Spectral Unmixing of Hyperspectral Data Using the Image Space Reconstruction Algorithm","volume":"5","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2012","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12557647","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081957/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of Abundance Estimation for Spectral Unmixing of Hyperspectral Data Using the Image Space Reconstruction Algorithm","sourcePdf":"jstars-plaza-2171673-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120252S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6157671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6157671","articleId":"6081957","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6081962,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongjing Ma","affiliation":["School of Automation and the Key Laboratory of Complex System Intelligent Control and Decision, Beijing Institute of Technology, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/6384889/6081962/6081962-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhongjing Ma received the B.Eng. degree from Nankai University, Tianjin, China, in 1997, the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees from McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2005 and 2009, respectively, all in the area of systems and control.","After a period as a postdoctoral research fellow with the Center of Sustainable Systems, the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, he joined Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2010, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

The foundation of the paper is a model that assumes PEVs are cost-minimizing and weakly coupled via a common electricity price. At a Nash equilibrium, each PEV reacts optimally with respect to a commonly observed charging trajectory that is the average of all PEV strategies. This average is given by the solution of a fixed point problem in the limit of infinite population size. The ideal solution minimizes electricity generation costs by scheduling PEV demand to fill the overnight non-PEV demand \u201cvalley\u201d. The paper's central theoretical result is a proof of the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium that almost satisfies that ideal. This result is accompanied by a decentralized computational algorithm and a proof that the algorithm converges to the Nash equilibrium in the infinite system limit. Several numerical examples are used to illustrate the performance of the solution strategy for finite populations. The examples demonstrate that convergence to the Nash equilibrium occurs very quickly over a broad range of parameters, and suggest this method could be useful in situations where frequent communication with PEVs is not possible. The method is useful in applications where fully centralized control is not possible, but where optimal or near-optimal charging patterns are essential to system operation.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2011.2174059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/6384889/06081962.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6384889","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2011.2174059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Charging Control of Large Populations of Plug-in Electric Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Charging Control of Large Populations of Plug-in Electric Vehicles","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081962/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13188277","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6081962/","volume":"21","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Charging Control of Large Populations of Plug-in Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tcst-callaway-2174059-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076032S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6384889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"549","xplore-issue":"6384889","articleId":"6081962","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6081970,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo G.

However, previously proposed ANNs either do not account for PM-AM and PM-PM distortions or do not satisfy a fundamental constraint imposed by the bandpass nature of wireless transmitters. The purpose of this work is twofold. First, it is shown that PM-AM and PM-PM distortions observed in wireless transmitters excited by wideband signals can have a significant impact on the performance of their behavioral models. Second, a novel ANN topology for wireless transmitter behavioral modeling is proposed. Contrary to previously published ANNs, this one only generates physically meaningful contributions as well as retaining the ability of accounting for PM-AM and PM-PM distortions. The accuracy of the proposed ANN is then compared with two commonly used ANNs of the same computational complexity and for fitting experimental data measured on a GaN-based class-AB amplifier chain. Improvements of up to 7 dB in NMSE and ACEPR results are achieved if the proposed ANN is used instead of a commonly used ANN that neglects the PM-AM and PM-PM distortions. Furthermore, improvements as high as 16 dB in NMSE and ACEPR are achieved by the proposed ANN in comparison with a traditional ANN that also accounts for the PM-AM and PM-PM distortions but does not satisfy the fundamental odd-parity constraint imposed by the bandpass nature of wireless transmitters.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6097087/06081970.pdf","startPage":"3512","endPage":"3521","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2171709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2171709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6097087","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Physically Meaningful Neural Network Behavioral Model for Wireless Transmitters Exhibiting PM\u2013AM/PM\u2013PM Distortions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Wireless communication","Distortion","Nonlinear filters","Artificial neural networks","Power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","computational complexity","neural nets","power amplifiers","radio transmitters","telecommunication computing","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physically meaningful neural network behavioral model","wireless transmitters","PM-AM distortions","PM-PM distortions","artificial neural networks","low-pass equivalent behavior","bandpass nature","wideband signals","ANN topology","wireless transmitter behavioral modeling","computational complexity","class-AB amplifier chain","NMSE","ACEPR","fundamental odd-parity constraint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural networks (ANNs)","modeling","nonlinear filters","power amplifiers (PAs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Physically Meaningful Neural Network Behavioral Model for Wireless Transmitters Exhibiting PM\u2013AM/PM\u2013PM Distortions","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6081970/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408809","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Physically Meaningful Neural Network Behavioral Model for Wireless Transmitters Exhibiting PM\u2013AM/PM\u2013PM Distortions","sourcePdf":"tmtt-lima-2171709-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115588S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6097087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6097087","articleId":"6081970","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6081971,"authors":[{"name":"Han-Chih Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6097087/6081971/6081971-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Han-Chih Yeh (S'11) was born in Taichung, Taiwan, on January 30, 1981.

Two low-power (LP), miniature, and wideband low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) were designed and fabricated for demonstration. One with a transformer triple-cascode configuration was designed at \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V</i>\n-band, and the other with a transformer quadruple-cascode configuration was designed at \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Q</i>\n-band. Both of the two LNAs were fabricated using 90-nm LP CMOS technology. To minimize the noise figure (NF) and maximize both the small-signal gain and 3-dB bandwidth, the noise-reduction transformers are designed and placed between transistors of the triple- and quadruple-cascode devices. Based on this approach, the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Q</i>\n-band LNA has a gain of 20.3 dB and an NF of 4.6 dB at 40 GHz, with a power consumption of 15 mW. Both of the LNA utilize a 3-V supply voltage, but the drain source voltage of each device in the multicascode configuration is below 1 V. The \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V</i>\n-band LNA presents a gain of 12.7 dB from 43 to 58 GHz and a minimum NF of 4.7 dB at 62.5 GHz with a power consumption of 18 mW.

Three fully-fabricated 2D circuit wafers are stacked using standard CMOS fabrication techniques including thin-film planarization, layer alignment and oxide bonding. Micron-scale dense 3D vias are fabricated to interconnect circuits between tiers. Ionizing dose and single event effects are discussed for proton irradiation with energies between 4.8 and 500 MeV. Results are compared with 14-MeV neutron irradiation. Single event upset cross section, tier-to-tier and angular effects are discussed. The interaction of 500-MeV protons with tungsten interconnects is investigated using Monte-Carlo simulations. Results show no tier-to-tier effects and comparable radiation effects on 2D and 3D SRAMs. 3DIC technology should be a good candidate for fabricating circuits for space applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation Effects in 3D Integrated SOI SRAM Circuits","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2011.2172463","startPage":"2845","endPage":"2854","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2011.2172463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6093861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/6093861/06081972.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6081972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6081972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Radiation Effects in 3D Integrated SOI SRAM Circuits","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6081972/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408895","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation Effects in 3D Integrated SOI SRAM Circuits","sourcePdf":"tns-gouker-2172463-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137575S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"6093861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6093861","articleId":"6081972","onlineDate":"15 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6081974,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Joon Song","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, South Korea","Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Hwasung, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Joon","lastName":"Song","id":"38546523600"},{"name":"Bo Kyoung Choi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Bo Kyoung","lastName":"Choi","id":"37291844300"},{"name":"En Xia Zhang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"En Xia","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37591455500"},{"name":"Ronald D.

In most of the developing countries, investing in stocks, albeit the risk factor is the most lucrative way of earning quick bucks. This has lead to the development of various models for financial markets and investment. Black-Scholes model opened a new domain for research in the field of stock markets. The model develops partial differential equations whose solution, the Black-Scholes formula, is widely used in the pricing of European-style options. The Aim of \"Neural Network Based Stock Price Forecasting Model\" is to develop a Model which will be used to Forecast Future Stock Prices using handheld Android Mobile phones. It will be developed by using one of the Concepts in Artificial Intelligence [8], \"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have rapidly grown in popularity. They are artificial intelligence adaptive software systems that have been inspired by how biological neural networks work. They are used because they can learn to detect complex patterns in data. In mathematical terms, they are universal function approximators, meaning that given the right data and configured correctly; they can capture and model any input-output relationships. This not only removes the need for human interpretation of charts or the series of rules for generating entry/exit signals, but also provides a bridge to fundamental analysis, as the variables used in fundamental analysis can be used as input. As ANNs are essentially non-linear statistical models, their accuracy and prediction capabilities can be both mathematically and empirically tested. In various studies, authors have claimed that neural networks used for generating trading signals given various technical and fundamental inputs have significantly outperformed buy-hold strategies as well as traditional linear technical analysis methods when combined with rule-based expert systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082001/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12386654","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082001/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Punctilious Training of Neural Networks for Efficacious Applications of Predictions in Android Phones","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Punctilious Training of Neural Networks for Efficacious Applications of Predictions in Android Phones","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"4496a094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04281S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081838","isNumber":"6081996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081838","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6081996","articleId":"6082001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6082016,"authors":[{"name":"Waleed Ejaz","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Waleed","lastName":"Ejaz","id":"37671665700"},{"name":"Najam ul Hasan","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Najam ul","lastName":"Hasan","id":"38231522900"},{"name":"Saleem Aslam","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Saleem","lastName":"Aslam","id":"37545282800"},{"name":"Hyung Seok Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung Seok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37696369900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1080-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4496-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2897"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-2889"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-2889"}],"articleNumber":"6082016","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1363},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082016","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Matched filters","Fuzzy logic","Cognitive radio","Signal to noise ratio","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","fuzzy logic","probability","radio networks","signal processing","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio network","fuzzy logic based spectrum sensing","dynamic spectrum sensing","cooperative spectrum sensing","local sensing decision","reliable spectrum sensing","cooperation overhead cost","signal processing technique","primary user detection","sensing efficiency enhancement","energy detection","matched filter detection","cyclostationary detection","probability detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radios","software defined radio","primary user","spectrum sensing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NGMAST.2011.41","publicationTitle":"2011 Fifth International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Fifth International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6081838/6081996/06082016.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGMAST.2011.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Logic Based Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"It is inevitable for cognitive radio to find unutilized portion of the spectrum more accurately for successful deployment of dynamic spectrum sensing. To achieve highly reliable spectrum sensing, usually cooperative spectrum sensing is employed but still there is a margin to improve local sensing decisions. Cooperative spectrum sensing improves reliability of sensing at the cost of cooperation overhead among cognitive radio users, which can be reduced by improving local spectrum sensing. Several signal processing techniques for primary user detection have been proposed in literature but still there is room for researchers in this field to explore more sophisticated approaches to enhance sensing efficiency. This paper proposes a two stage local spectrum sensing approach. In first step, each cognitive radio perform existing spectrum sensing techniques i.e. energy detection, matched filter detection and cyclostationary detection. While in second stage, the output from each technique employed in step 1 is combined using fuzzy logic to ultimately decide about the presence or absence of primary user. The proposed approach shows significant improvement in sensing accuracy by exhibiting higher probability of detection and low false alarms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082016/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12386666","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082016/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Logic Based Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Logic Based Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"4496a185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123001S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081838","isNumber":"6081996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081838","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6081996","articleId":"6082016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6082037,"authors":[{"name":"Nazar Radhi","affiliation":["Wireless Network & Communication Centre, School of Engineering & Design, Brunel University, London, UK"],"firstName":"Nazar","lastName":"Radhi","id":"38324804100"},{"name":"H.S.

The effect number of CR nodes, spacing of inter node, topology, noise, distance of source to node, node failure, location perturbation on the location estimation performance have been studied through MATLAB simulation. Simulation result illustrate that the error difference can be reduced by increasing the number of CR nodes or the spacing inter nodes and improve the location estimation accuracy.

The core of the photonic beamformer consists of an optical ring resonator (ORR) filter-based beamforming network (BFN). ORR filters are capable to provide continuously tunable true time delays (TTDs) with configurable bandwidth, and serve as delay elements in a BFN allowing squint-free and seamless beam steering for gigahertz bandwidth applications. Therefore, this approach is superior to the BFNs using phase shifters, discrete time delays or digital BFNs. This photonic beamformer also features optical single-sideband suppressed-carrier modulation and coherent optical detection techniques, resulting in reduced number of ORRs in the BFN. Other system components such as the optical sideband filter, optical signal combining and carrier reinsertion circuitry are integrated with the ORRs in one photonic BFN chip. In the past, a laboratory demonstrator of such an antenna system has been realized as a proof-of-concept, incorporating individually packaged components, such as LNBs and optical modulators. Currently, there is a large effort in the development of the key components, namely front-end, optical modulator, and photonic BFN, and the integration between them, aiming for the actual deployment of the antenna system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12385872","htmlLink":"/document/6082117/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Development of an integrated photonic beamformer for electronically-steered K<inf>u</inf>-band phased array antenna","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of an integrated photonic beamformer for electronically-steered K<inf>u</inf>-band phased array antenna","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"021WA2224156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047286S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069667","isNumber":"6082092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069667","xplore-issue":"6082092","articleId":"6082117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6082129,"authors":[{"name":"J.

At every time of the evolution a parallel graphics card speeds up the optimization process by calculating, in parallel, the fitness value of all particles. Two different approaches are investigated: a fine-grained parallelism and a coarse-grained one. The results demonstrate that GPUs can be applied with success to speed up computationally intensive problems in electric energy systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 16th International Conference on Intelligent System Applications to Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069629/6082157/06082162.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 16th International Conference on Intelligent System Applications to Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISAP.2011.6082162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAP.2011.6082162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082157","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GPU accelerated PSO with application to Economic Dispatch problem","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","load dispatching","parallel architectures","particle swarm optimisation","power engineering computing","power system economics","search problems","stochastic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU accelerated PSO","economic dispatch problem","graphics processing units","general purpose parallel architecture","stochastic search algorithm","comprehensive learning particle swarm optimizer","parallel graphics card","fine grained parallelism","coarse grained parallelism","electric energy system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","CLPSO","Graphics card","GPU","GPGPU","CUDA","OpenCL","Economic Dispatch"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A GPU accelerated PSO with application to Economic Dispatch problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082162/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12385652","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GPU accelerated PSO with application to Economic Dispatch problem","confLoc":"Hersonissos, Greece","sourcePdf":"105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075772S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069629","isNumber":"6082157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069629","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6082157","articleId":"6082162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6082187,"authors":[{"name":"Luis S.

This task impacts on voltage regulation as well as the loadability of lines, which are key elements for modern distribution companies. However, the capacitor placement problem usually leads to a combinatorial optimization problem classified as a NP-hard. Because of its complexity, different models based on heuristic strategies have been proposed to solve this problem. In this work, an evolutionary strategy -as a global search methodology- is proposed. The corresponding capacitor placement problem is formulated as a second stage of the solution for the distribution planning problem when the planner deals with large distribution systems. This stage defines the placement and dimension of the required capacitor banks to reduce both losses and voltage drop. Final results are presented for a 4083 nodes system.","doi":"10.1109/ISAP.2011.6082187","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069629/6082157/06082187.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 16th International Conference on Intelligent System Applications to Power Systems","publicationTitle":"2011 16th International Conference on Intelligent System Applications to Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAP.2011.6082187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms for the capacitor placement problem in distribution networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082187/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms for the capacitor placement problem in distribution networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12385676","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6082187/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms for the capacitor placement problem in distribution networks","confLoc":"Hersonissos, Greece","sourcePdf":"134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060136S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069629","isNumber":"6082157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069629","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6082157","articleId":"6082187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6082188,"authors":[{"name":"M.

One of the typical deployments of PV systems is without supervisory mechanisms to monitor the physical conditions of cells or modules. In the longer term operation, the cells or modules may undergo fault conditions since they are exposure to the environment. Manually module checking is not recommended in this case because of time-consuming, less accuracy and potentially danger to the operator. Therefore, provision of early automatic diagnosis technique with quick and efficient responses is highly necessary. Since high accuracy is the important issue in the diagnosis problems, the paper present fault diagnosis method using three-layered artificial neural network. A single artificial neural network (ANN) is not suitable to provide precise solution for this fault identification. Therefore, several ANNs are developed, then automatic control based module voltage terminal is established. The proposed method is simple and accurate to detect the exact location of short-circuit condition of PV modules in array.","doi":"10.1109/ISAP.2011.6082219","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 16th International Conference on Intelligent System Applications to Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAP.2011.6082219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082157","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 16th International Conference on Intelligent System Applications to Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069629/6082157/06082219.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controlling of artificial neural network for fault diagnosis of photovoltaic array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082219/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Controlling of artificial neural network for fault diagnosis of photovoltaic array","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082219/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12385708","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controlling of artificial neural network for fault diagnosis of photovoltaic array","confLoc":"Hersonissos, Greece","sourcePdf":"3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057393S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069629","isNumber":"6082157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069629","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6082157","articleId":"6082219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":6082271,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Franck","affiliation":["Fraunhofer IDMT, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Franck","id":"37541150300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0693-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0692-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0691-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-1168"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1931-1168"}],"articleNumber":"6082271","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":478},"abstract":"Arbitrary sample rate conversion (ASRC) is used in many applications of DSP. ASRC algorithms based on integer-ratio oversampling and continuous-time resampling filters enable good resampling quality for wideband signals. A previous publication introduced an overall optimization scheme for structures based on oversampling and Lagrange interpolation to design the oversampling component such that the design error of the overall frequency response is minimized with respect to a selectable error norm. However, the achievable quality strongly depends on the continuous-time resampling filters. Lagrange interpolators show severe deficiencies when used in this role. The present paper proposes a design objective for continuous time resampling filters that are specifically adapted for use with oversampling and the overall optimization scheme. ASRC systems utilizing these so-called optimized image band attenuation (OIB) resampling functions achieve significant quality improvements over existing approaches. Performance analyses show that this class of filters enables implementations with reduced complexity for a wide range of design specifications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

paper proposes new formulations and algorithms for a multichannel extension of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), intending convolutive sound source separation with multiple microphones. The proposed formulation employs Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices to represent a multichannel version of nonnegative elements. Such matrices are basically estimated for NMF bases, but a source separation task can be performed by introducing variables that relate NMF bases and sources. Efficient optimization algorithms in the form of multiplicative updates are derived by using properly designed auxiliary functions. Experimental results show that two instrumental sounds coming from different directions were successfully separated by the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12377459","htmlLink":"/document/6082275/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"New formulations and efficient algorithms for multichannel NMF","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New formulations and efficient algorithms for multichannel NMF","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"W111801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059554S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069888","isNumber":"6082260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069888","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6082260","articleId":"6082275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6082294,"authors":[{"name":"John McDonough","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"McDonough","id":"37284494500"},{"name":"Bhiksha Raj","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Bhiksha","lastName":"Raj","id":"37274448400"},{"name":"Kenichi Kumatani","affiliation":["Disney Research, Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Kumatani","id":"37318460300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0693-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0692-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0691-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-1168"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1931-1168"}],"articleNumber":"6082294","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Covariance matrix","Array signal processing","Speech recognition","Microphones","Speech","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","covariance matrices","error analysis","interference suppression","Kalman filters","matrix algebra","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum kurtosis beamforming technique","voice prompt suppression algorithm","Kalman filter","information space","information matrix","subband filter magnitude","square root","information filter VPS algorithm","Cholesky factor","error covariance matrix","speech recognition","word error rate reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["acoustic echo cancellation","speech recognition","beamforming","information filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082294","doi":"10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082294","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","abstract":"In earlier work, we proposed a voice prompt suppression (VPS) algorithm based on a Kalman filter, in which the temporal update or correction step is performed in information space.

In this work, we extend that earlier work by proposing a square root implementation of the information filter VPS algorithm, as well as a technique for diagonally loading the Cholesky factor of the error covariance matrix used in this implementation. We also investigate the effectiveness of cascading VPS after maximum kurtosis beamforming, which has been shown to provide performance superior to all conventional beamforming techniques. In a set of distant speech recognition experiments we demonstrate that VPS can reduce word error rate from 19.9% to 16.1% for an adult speaker, and from 44.4% to 40.0% for a child.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082260","startPage":"25","endPage":"28","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069888/6082260/06082294.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the combination of voice prompt suppression with maximum kurtosis beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6082294/","displayDocTitle":"On the combination of voice prompt suppression with maximum kurtosis beamforming","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377478","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the combination of voice prompt suppression with maximum kurtosis beamforming","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"W112160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046064S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069888","isNumber":"6082260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069888","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6082260","articleId":"6082294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6082298,"authors":[{"name":"R\u00e9mi Mignot","affiliation":["Institut Langevin, ESPCI ParisTech, CNRS UMR 7587, University Paris Diderot-UPMC Univ Paris 06, Paris, France"],"firstName":"R\u00e9mi","lastName":"Mignot","id":"37399504100"},{"name":"Laurent Daudet","affiliation":["Institut Langevin, ESPCI ParisTech, CNRS UMR 7587, University Paris Diderot-UPMC Univ Paris 06, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Daudet","id":"37332759400"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Ollivier","affiliation":["Institut Jean Le Rond d'Alembert, CNRS UMR 7190, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Ollivier","id":"37352372200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0693-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0692-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0691-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-1168"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1931-1168"}],"articleNumber":"6082298","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":473},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphones","Interpolation","Arrays","Matching pursuit algorithms","Acoustics","Vectors","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","interpolation","iterative methods","microphone arrays","signal reconstruction","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic response reconstruction","interpolation","room impulse response reconstruction","time domain","model-based compressed sensing","3D microphone array","matching pursuit algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed Sensing","Room Impulse Responses","Interpolation","Microphone Arrays","Source Localization"]}],"abstract":"The goal of this paper is to interpolate Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) within a whole volume, from a few measurements.

More specifically, we apply compressed sensing techniques to a set of Ambisonic sound signals to obtain a super-resolution plane-wave decomposition of the original sound field. That is to say, we investigate using the plane-wave decomposition to increase the spherical harmonic order of the Ambisonic sound scene. We refer to this as upscaling the Ambisonic sound scene. A focus of the paper is using sub-band analysis to make the plane-wave decomposition more robust. Results show that the sub-band analysis does indeed improve the robustness of the plane-wave decomposition when dominant overlapping sources are present or in noisy or diffuse sound conditions. Upscaling Ambisonic sound scenes allows more loudspeakers to be used for spatial sound field reconstruction, resulting in a larger sweet spot and improved sound quality.","doi":"10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082301","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069888/6082260/06082301.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082260","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Upscaling Ambisonic sound scenes using compressed sensing techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Upscaling Ambisonic sound scenes using compressed sensing techniques","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082301/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377485","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6082301/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Upscaling Ambisonic sound scenes using compressed sensing techniques","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"W112193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061503S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069888","isNumber":"6082260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069888","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6082260","articleId":"6082301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6082303,"authors":[{"name":"Nasser Mohammadiha","affiliation":["Sound and Image Processing Laboratory, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Nasser","lastName":"Mohammadiha","id":"37394550500"},{"name":"Timo Gerkmann","affiliation":["Sound and Image Processing Laboratory, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Gerkmann","id":"37646480900"},{"name":"Arne Leijon","affiliation":["Sound and Image Processing Laboratory, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Arne","lastName":"Leijon","id":"37394551100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0693-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0692-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0691-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-1168"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1931-1168"}],"articleNumber":"6082303","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":616},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Speech enhancement","Noise measurement","Signal processing algorithms","Signal to noise ratio","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain analysis","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","matrix decomposition","speech enhancement","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear MMSE filter","channel speech enhancement","nonnegative matrix factorization","minimum mean square error method","frequency domain analysis","power spectral density","NMF","PSD","Wiener filter","noise tracker","source to distortion ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech enhancement","nonnegative matrix factorization","Linear MMSE filter"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new linear MMSE filter for single channel speech enhancement based on Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082303","doi":"10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082303","startPage":"45","endPage":"48","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069888/6082260/06082303.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082260","abstract":"In this paper, a linear MMSE filter is derived for single-channel speech enhancement which is based on Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Assuming an additive model for the noisy observation, an estimator is obtained by minimizing the mean square error between the clean speech and the estimated speech components in the frequency domain. In addition, the noise power spectral density (PSD) is estimated using NMF and the obtained noise PSD is used in a Wiener filtering framework to enhance the noisy speech. The results of the both algorithms are compared to the result of the same Wiener filtering framework in which the noise PSD is estimated using a recently developed MMSE-based method. NMF based approaches outperform the Wiener filter with the MMSE-based noise PSD tracker for different measures. Compared to the NMF-based Wiener filtering approach, Source to Distortion Ratio (SDR) is improved for the evaluated noise types for different input SNRs using the proposed linear MMSE filter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082303/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082303/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377487","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"A new linear MMSE filter for single channel speech enhancement based on Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new linear MMSE filter for single channel speech enhancement based on Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"W112195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071637S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069888","isNumber":"6082260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069888","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6082260","articleId":"6082303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6082314,"authors":[{"name":"Augustin Lef\u00e8vre","affiliation":["LTCI Telecom ParisTech, CNRS, Paris, France","ENS Sierra team, INRIA, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Augustin","lastName":"Lef\u00e8vre","id":"38229432400"},{"name":"Francis Bach","affiliation":["ENS Sierra team, INRIA, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Francis","lastName":"Bach","id":"37281561400"},{"name":"C\u00e9dric F\u00e9votte","affiliation":["LTCI Telecom ParisTech, CNRS, Paris, France"],"firstName":"C\u00e9dric","lastName":"F\u00e9votte","id":"37284366200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0693-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0692-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0691-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-1168"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1931-1168"}],"articleNumber":"6082314","dbTime":"36 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":516},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Training","Dictionaries","Conferences","Signal processing","Acoustics","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","matrix decomposition","source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online algorithms","nonnegative matrix factorization","Itakura Saito divergence","audio source separation","power spectrograms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["nonnegative matrix factorization","online algorithms","Itakura-Saito divergence","blind source separation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082314","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082260","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069888/6082260/06082314.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online algorithms for nonnegative matrix factorization with the Itakura-Saito divergence","abstract":"Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is now a common tool for audio source separation.

In audio signal analysis, an important goal is to decompose music signals into individual notes, with applications such as music transcription, source separation or note-level manipulation. Recently, the use of latent variable decompositions, especially nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), has been a very active area of research. These methods are facing two, mutually dependent, problems: first, instrument sounds often exhibit time-varying spectra, and grasping this time-varying nature is an important factor to characterize the diversity of each instrument; moreover, in many cases we do not know in advance the number of sources and which instruments are played. Conventional decompositions generally fail to cope with these issues as they suffer from the difficulties of automatically determining the number of sources and automatically grouping spectra into single events. We address both these problems by developing a Bayesian nonparametric fusion of NMF and hidden Markov model (HMM). Our model decomposes music spectrograms in an automatically estimated number of components, each of which consisting in an HMM whose number of states is also automatically estimated from the data.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069888/6082260/06082324.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"328","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","doi":"10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082260","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian nonparametric spectrogram modeling based on infinite factorial infinite hidden Markov model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Instruments","Bayesian methods","Spectrogram","Multiple signal classification","Signal analysis","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","Bayes methods","hidden Markov models","matrix decomposition","source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian nonparametric spectrogram","infinite factorial infinite hidden Markov model","Bayesian nonparametric latent source discovery","music signal analysis","audio signal analysis","music transcription","source separation","note-level manipulation","nonnegative matrix factorization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)","Hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP)","Infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM)","Gamma process","Collapsed variational Bayes (CVB)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian nonparametric spectrogram modeling based on infinite factorial infinite hidden Markov model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082324/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377508","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian nonparametric spectrogram modeling based on infinite factorial infinite hidden Markov model","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"W112289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059631S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069888","isNumber":"6082260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069888","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6082260","articleId":"6082324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6082331,"authors":[{"name":"Courtenay V.

Typical approaches to the problem use short-term spectral features to describe the audio signal, with additional modeling on top to take temporal context into account. We propose an approach to detecting and modeling acoustic events that directly describes temporal context, using convolutive non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). NMF is useful for finding parts-based decompositions of data; here it is used to discover a set of spectro-temporal patch bases that best describe the data, with the patches corresponding to event-like structures. We derive features from the activations of these patch bases, and perform event detection on a database consisting of 16 classes of meeting-room acoustic events. We compare our approach with a baseline using standard short-term mel frequency cepstal coefficient (MFCC) features. We demonstrate that the event-based system is more robust in the presence of added noise than the MFCC-based system, and that a combination of the two systems performs even better than either individually.","doi":"10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082331","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069888/6082260/06082331.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral vs. spectro-temporal features for acoustic event detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082331","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082331/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral vs. spectro-temporal features for acoustic event detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377515","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082331/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral vs. spectro-temporal features for acoustic event detection","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"W112300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045621S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069888","isNumber":"6082260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069888","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6082260","articleId":"6082331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6082332,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua Atkins","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Atkins","id":"37722135000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0693-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0692-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0691-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-1168"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1931-1168"}],"articleNumber":"6082332","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":551},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Harmonic analysis","Microphone arrays","Acoustic beams","Loudspeakers","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","loudspeakers","microphone arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust beamforming","steering","arbitrary beam patterns","loudspeaker arrays","compact method","three-dimensional sound fields","sensor self-noise","placement errors","robustness constraints","beamformer design","robust beam pattern design","spherical microphone array recordings","headphones","head tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spherical microphone array","robustness","beamforming","spherical loudspeaker array","head-related transfer function (HRTF)","surround sound","binaural rendering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082332","doi":"10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082332","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","abstract":"Spherical microphone and loudspeaker arrays present a compact method for analysis and synthesis of arbitrary three-dimensional sound fields.

The technique is used for two applications: reproducing spherical microphone array recordings over loudspeaker arrays and binaurally over headphones with head tracking.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082260","startPage":"237","endPage":"240","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069888/6082260/06082332.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust beamforming and steering of arbitrary beam patterns using spherical arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6082332/","displayDocTitle":"Robust beamforming and steering of arbitrary beam patterns using spherical arrays","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377516","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust beamforming and steering of arbitrary beam patterns using spherical arrays","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"W112303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040866S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069888","isNumber":"6082260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069888","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6082260","articleId":"6082332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6082334,"authors":[{"name":"\u0141ukasz Litwic","affiliation":["Centre of Vision, Speech and Signal Processing, University of Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"\u0141ukasz","lastName":"Litwic","id":"37086471595"},{"name":"Philip JB Jackson","affiliation":["Centre of Vision, Speech and Signal Processing, University of Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Philip JB","lastName":"Jackson","id":"37281760600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0693-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0692-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0691-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-1168"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1931-1168"}],"articleNumber":"6082334","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time frequency analysis","Data models","Speech","Histograms","Signal processing algorithms","Delay effects","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source separation","speech processing","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source localization","source separation","phase cues","multiple speech sources","RANSAC approach","random sample consensus approach","interaural phase differences","IPD","phase ambiguity problems","reverberation noise","time-frequency binary masks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082334","abstract":"In this paper we present a system for localization and separation of multiple speech sources using phase cues. The novelty of this method is the use of Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) approach to find consistency of interaural phase differences (IPDs) across the whole frequency range. This approach is inherently free from phase ambiguity problems and enables all phase data to contribute to localization. Another property of RANSAC is its robustness against outliers which enables multiple source localization with phase data contaminated by reverberation noise. Results of RANSAC based localization are fed into a mixture model to generate time-frequency binary masks for separation. System performance is compared against other well known methods and shows similar or improved performance in reverberant conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082334","startPage":"337","endPage":"340","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069888/6082260/06082334.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Source localization and separation using Random Sample Consensus with phase cues","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Source localization and separation using Random Sample Consensus with phase cues","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082334/","accessionNumber":"12377518","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082334/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source localization and separation using Random Sample Consensus with phase cues","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"W112309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051956S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069888","isNumber":"6082260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069888","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6082260","articleId":"6082334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6082336,"authors":[{"name":"Kenichi Kumatani","affiliation":["Disney Research, Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Kumatani","id":"37318460300"},{"name":"John McDonough","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"McDonough","id":"37284494500"},{"name":"Bhiksha Raj","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Bhiksha","lastName":"Raj","id":"37274448400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0693-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0692-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0691-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-1168"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1931-1168"}],"articleNumber":"6082336","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Speech","Speech recognition","Vectors","Microphones","Estimation","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","interference suppression","reverberation","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block-wise incremental adaptation algorithm","maximum kurtosis beamforming","human speech","distortionless constraint","interference suppression","reverberation effects","signal cancellation","active weight vector","speech recognition","word error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Kurtosis","Beamforming","Microphone array","Distant speech recognition"]}],"abstract":"In prior work, the current authors investigated beamforming algorithms that exploit the non-Gaussianity of human speech. The beamformers proposed in [1, 2, 3] are designed to maximize the kurtosis or negentropy of the subband output subject to the distortionless constraint for the direction of interest. Such techniques are able to suppress interference signals as well as reverberation effects without signal cancellation. They require, however, multiple passes of processing for each utterance in order to estimate the active weight vector. Hence, they are unsuitable for online implementation. In this work, we propose an online implementation of the maximum kurtosis beamformer. In a set of distant speech recognition experiments on far-field data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. Compared to a single channel of the array, the proposed algorithm reduced word error rate from 15.4% to 6.5%.","doi":"10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082336","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069888/6082260/06082336.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082336","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","startPage":"229","endPage":"232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-wise incremental adaptation algorithm for maximum kurtosis beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Block-wise incremental adaptation algorithm for maximum kurtosis beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082336/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082336/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377520","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-wise incremental adaptation algorithm for maximum kurtosis beamforming","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"W112314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060666S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069888","isNumber":"6082260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069888","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6082260","articleId":"6082336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6082344,"authors":[{"name":"Paris Smaragdis","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Laboratories, Adobe Systems Inc., University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Paris","lastName":"Smaragdis","id":"37298269900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0693-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0692-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0691-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-1168"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1931-1168"}],"articleNumber":"6082344","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training data","Vectors","Training","Signal processing","Estimation","Search problems","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","music","search problems","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polyphonic pitch tracking","periodicity detection","learning","pitch tagged recordings","nearest subspace search problem","sparse coding","quintet recordings"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polyphonic pitch tracking"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082344","doi":"10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082260","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069888/6082260/06082344.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polyphonic pitch tracking by example","abstract":"We introduce a novel approach for pitch tracking of multiple sources in mixture signals.

After clarifying the reason for the throughput deterioration by taking insight into the users' experienced channel vectors distribution in the complex hypersphere, the way of constructing the optimized codebook is designed. Then the new DL transmission strategy utilizing the reciprocity between uplink (UL) and DL in the sense of large scale fading is proposed for throughput improvement but without the great modification on the existing system in the context of LTE-A.

It serves as a solution to the orphan-symbol (3-time-slot) transmit diversity issue raised in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Transmitting antennas","Dispersion","Complexity theory","Bit error rate","Slot antennas","Block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","antenna arrays","decoding","space-time block codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3-time-slot group-decodable STBC","space-time block codes","arbitrary code dimensions","odd time slot","code construction method","transmit antennas","symbol-wise decoding complexity","orphan-symbol transmit diversity issue","3rd Generation Partnership Project standard","3GPP standard","full-rate code","full-diversity code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Space-time block codes/coding (STBC)","Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A)","group-decodability (quasi-orthogonality)","orphan-symbol transmission"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2011.110711.111783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6132225/06082359.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6132225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2011.110711.111783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-Time-Slot Group-Decodable STBC with Full Rate and Full Diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082359","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3-Time-Slot Group-Decodable STBC with Full Rate and Full Diversity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082359/","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082359/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12477996","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-Time-Slot Group-Decodable STBC with Full Rate and Full Diversity","sourcePdf":"086-cl1201-ren.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032541S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6132225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6132225","articleId":"6082359","onlineDate":"16 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6082361,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Shen","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Shen","id":"37287404100"},{"name":"Haiquan Wang","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Haiquan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280092800"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278432600"},{"name":"Zhijin Zhao","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Zhijin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37279725500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6082361","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1046},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Antennas","Noise","Vectors","Covariance matrix","Testing","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cognitive radio","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple antenna assisted blind spectrum sensing method","cognitive radio channels","empirical characteristic function","characteristic function testing problem","noise uncertainty"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","multiple antennas","spectrum sensing","empirical characteristic function","noise uncertainty"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082361","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2011.110711.111901","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","abstract":"In this letter, a multiple antennas assisted blind spectrum sensing method is proposed that does not need any information of primary user and the noise power.

In this letter, a new algorithm for endmember extraction, named modified vertex component analysis (MVCA), is presented. This new technique outperforms the popular vertex component analysis (VCA) by applying a low-complexity orthogonalization method and by utilizing integer instead of floating-point arithmetic when dealing with hyperspectral data. The feasibility of this technique is demonstrated by comparing its performance with VCA on synthetic mixtures as well as on the well-known Cuprite hyperspectral image. MVCA shows promising results in terms of much lower computational complexity, still reproducing similar endmember accuracy than its original counterpart. Moreover, the features of this algorithm combined with state-of-the-art hardware implementations qualify MVCA as a good potential candidate for all those applications in which real time is a must.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Vectors","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational complexity","Signal processing algorithms","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","feature extraction","geophysical image processing","geophysical techniques","remote sensing","spectral analysis","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-computational-complexity algorithm","hyperspectral endmember extraction","modified vertex component analysis","hyperspectral image processing","low-complexity orthogonalization method","floating-point arithmetic","hyperspectral data","Cuprite hyperspectral image","endmember accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Endmember extraction","hardware implementation","hyperspectral imaging","low computational cost","vertex component analysis (VCA)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082371","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2011.2172771","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/6163264/06082371.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2011.2172771","startPage":"502","endPage":"506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6163264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Computational-Complexity Algorithm for Hyperspectral Endmember Extraction: Modified Vertex Component Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Computational-Complexity Algorithm for Hyperspectral Endmember Extraction: Modified Vertex Component Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082371/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2011","volume":"9","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6082371/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12575031","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Computational-Complexity Algorithm for Hyperspectral Endmember Extraction: Modified Vertex Component Analysis","sourcePdf":"lgrs-lopez-2172771-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042048S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6163264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6163264","articleId":"6082371","onlineDate":"16 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6082373,"authors":[{"name":"Manav R.

A stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) design approach is proposed to optimize closed-loop performance while enforcing constraints. Conditions for stochastic convergence and robust constraints fulfillment of the closed-loop system are enforced by solving linear matrix inequality problems off line. Performance is optimized on line using multistage stochastic optimization based on enumeration of scenarios, that amounts to solving a quadratic program subject to either quadratic or linear constraints. In the latter case, an explicit form is computable to ease the implementation of the proposed SMPC law. The approach can deal with a very general class of stochastic disturbance processes with discrete probability distribution. The effectiveness of the proposed SMPC formulation is shown on a numerical example and compared to traditional MPC schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2176429","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6204118/06082380.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6204118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2176429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","startPage":"1468","endPage":"1480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stabilizing Model Predictive Control of Stochastic Constrained Linear Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Stabilizing Model Predictive Control of Stochastic Constrained Linear Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082380/","volume":"57","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6082380/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12746969","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilizing Model Predictive Control of Stochastic Constrained Linear Systems","sourcePdf":"tac-bemporad-2176429-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089969S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6204118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"6204118","articleId":"6082380","onlineDate":"16 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6082384,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Richter","affiliation":["Automatic Control Laboratory, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/6204118/6082384/6082384-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefan Richter received the M.Sc. degree in telematics from the Technical University of Graz, Austria, in 2007.

We investigate cold- and warm-starting strategies and provide an easily computable lower iteration bound for cold-starting and an asymptotic characterization of the bounds for warm-starting. Moreover, we characterize the set of MPC problems for which small iteration bounds and thus short solution times are expected. The theoretical findings and the practical relevance of the obtained lower iteration bounds are underpinned by various numerical examples and compared to certification results for a primal-dual interior point method.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2176389","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6204118/06082384.pdf","startPage":"1391","endPage":"1403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2176389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6204118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computational Complexity Certification for Real-Time MPC With Input Constraints <newline/>Based on the Fast Gradient Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082384/","displayDocTitle":"Computational Complexity Certification for Real-Time MPC With Input Constraints <newline/>Based on the Fast Gradient Method","volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12746972","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082384/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational Complexity Certification for Real-Time MPC With Input Constraints <newline/>Based on the Fast Gradient Method","sourcePdf":"tac-richter-2176389-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12479S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6204118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"6204118","articleId":"6082384","onlineDate":"16 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6082407,"authors":[{"name":"Manel Ben-Romdhane","affiliation":["CIRTACOM Research Laboratory, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis (SupCom), University of Carthage, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Manel","lastName":"Ben-Romdhane","id":"38329270300"},{"name":"Chiheb Rebai","affiliation":["CIRTACOM Research Laboratory, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis (SupCom), University of Carthage, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Chiheb","lastName":"Rebai","id":"37274179100"},{"name":"Adel Ghazel","affiliation":["CIRTACOM Research Laboratory, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis (SupCom), University of Carthage, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Adel","lastName":"Ghazel","id":"37283433500"},{"name":"Patricia Desgreys","affiliation":["LTCI-CNRS UMR 5141, Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications de Paris, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Patricia","lastName":"Desgreys","id":"37297286700"},{"name":"Patrick Loumeau","affiliation":["LTCI-CNRS UMR 5141, Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications de Paris, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Loumeau","id":"37265088100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6082407","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":673},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Baseband","AC-DC power converters","Computer architecture","3G mobile communication","Dynamic range"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","analogue-digital conversion","cellular radio","radio receivers","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonuniformly controlled analog-to-digital converter","SDR multistandard radio receiver","statistical parameter","random sampling frequency","time-quantized random sampling scheme","nonuniform sampling-based software defined radio","E-GSM/UMTS/IEEE802.11a multistandard receiver","nonprogrammable antialiasing filter","ADC","mean sampling frequency","frequency 124 MHz","word length 16 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog-to-digital converter (ADC)","multistandard radio receiver","nonuniform sampling (NUS)","software defined radio (SDR)"]}],"abstract":"A new multistandard radio receiver architecture is presented to take advantage of nonuniformly controlled analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

The MRTP includes three RSMPs that operate in multiple instruction multiple data (MIMD) mode asynchronously to exploit instruction-level parallelism. Each RSMP is based on single instruction multiple thread (SIMT) architecture to exploit thread-level parallelism. An RSMP consists of twelve scalar processing elements (SPEs) that run multiple threads in parallel synchronously: twelve scalar threads or four vector threads depending on an operating mode. A low datapath utilization caused by a branch divergence in SIMT architecture is improved by 19.9% on average by reconfiguring twelve SPEs between scalar SIMT and vector SIMT with 0.1% area overheads. Special function instructions occupy only 2% ~ 8% of kernel instructions so that a partial special function unit (PSFU) is implemented instead of a large dedicated SFU. The access conflicts with a look-up table (LUT) caused by concurrent accesses of twelve SPEs are reduced by a table loader (TBLD). The TBLD monitors concurrent requests from twelve SPEs and reduces an access count to LUT by distributing a coefficient to multiple SPEs with only one read-access to LUT.

The metamaterial is realized by periodically printed subwavelength metallic resonant patterns with embedded microwave varactors. The effective refractive index can be controlled by low direct-current (dc) bias voltage applied to the varactors. In-phase electromagnetic waves transmitting in different zones of such metamaterial slab experience different phase delays, and, consequently, the output direction of the transmitted wave can be steered with progressive phase shift along the interface. This antenna has a simple structure, is very easy to configure the beam direction, and has a low cost. Compared with conventional phased-array antennas, the radome approach has more flexibility to operate with different feeding antennas for various applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6112732/06082420.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2171981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2171981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112732","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-DC Voltage-Controlled Steering-Antenna Radome Utilizing Tunable Active Metamaterial","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Metamaterials","Refractive index","Varactors","Voltage control","Capacitance","Magnetic materials","Antenna feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna phased arrays","delays","electromagnetic waves","metamaterial antennas","metamaterials","refractive index","varactors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-DC voltage-controlled steering-antenna radome","tunable active metamaterial","tunable refractive index","periodically printed subwavelength metallic resonant patterns","embedded microwave varactors","low direct-current bias voltage","in-phase electromagnetic waves","metamaterial slab","phase delays","phased-array antennas","feeding antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Metamaterial","steering antenna","varactor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Low-DC Voltage-Controlled Steering-Antenna Radome Utilizing Tunable Active Metamaterial","volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6082420/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12427050","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-DC Voltage-Controlled Steering-Antenna Radome Utilizing Tunable Active Metamaterial","sourcePdf":"tmtt-li-2171981-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119111S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6112732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6112732","articleId":"6082420","onlineDate":"16 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6082424,"authors":[{"name":"Fu-Kang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6097087/6082424/6082424-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fu-Kang Wang (S'10) was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on May 15, 1985.

The theory provides a basis for determining the signal-to-noise spectral density ratio (SNDR) with the effects of clutter. Experimental results agree closely with the theoretical predictions, showing that the clutter does not affect the optimal SNR performance in an SIL radar. A single-antenna SIL radar array is designed to detect vital signs with random body movement cancellation. To this end, a subject is placed between two single-antenna SIL radars to measure the rates of respiration and heartbeat using Doppler shift, and the effects of random movement of the subject are cancelled by wireless mutual injection locking (MIL) of the two radars. In an experiment, a prototype of such a two-radar array with a spacing of 2 m was implemented at 2.4 GHz, providing accurate and reliable cardiopulmonary monitoring of a subject who jogged on a treadmill with random body motion of many centimeters.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6097087/06082424.pdf","startPage":"3577","endPage":"3587","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2171712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2171712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6097087","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Antenna Doppler Radars Using Self and Mutual Injection Locking for Vital Sign Detection With Random Body Movement Cancellation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clutter","Radar antennas","Doppler radar","Injection-locked oscillators","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Biomedical measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","CW radar","Doppler radar","Doppler shift","radar clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-antenna Doppler radars","vital sign detection","random body movement cancellation","self-injection-locked radar","hardware complexity","continuous-wave Doppler systems","CW","signal-to-noise spectral density","SNDR","radar clutter","single-antenna SIL radar array","wireless mutual injection locking","MIL","cardiopulmonary monitoring","respiration rate","heartbeat rate","Doppler shift","frequency 2.4 GHz","size 2 m"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clutter effects","continuous-wave (CW) radar","Doppler radar","injection locking","random body movement cancellation","vital sign detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Single-Antenna Doppler Radars Using Self and Mutual Injection Locking for Vital Sign Detection With Random Body Movement Cancellation","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6082424/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408815","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Antenna Doppler Radars Using Self and Mutual Injection Locking for Vital Sign Detection With Random Body Movement Cancellation","sourcePdf":"tmtt-wang-2171712-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076606S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6097087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"6097087","articleId":"6082424","onlineDate":"16 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6082427,"authors":[{"name":"E.

This reduction reveals intrinsic distortion, which is a key performance limiter in modern pulsewidth-modulation (PWM)-based class-D amps. In this brief, a dual-feedforward carrier modulation topology is proposed to reduce the intrinsic harmonic distortion of a second-order loop filter class-D amp. The proposed design achieves a total harmonic distortion of less than 0.01% for input frequency up to 6 kHz, and it has an idle carrier frequency of 310 kHz. Such low carrier frequency is particularly important in high-power devices as it guarantees low switching loss. Moreover, the carrier frequency varies in a narrow range in the presence of an input signal and helps to suppress the audible intermodulation distortion in multichannel applications. The prototype circuit is implemented and tested on a printed circuit board using discrete components.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6082429/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12472348","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Dual-Feedforward Carrier-Modulated Second-Order Class-D Amplifier With Improved THD","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dual-Feedforward Carrier-Modulated Second-Order Class-D Amplifier With Improved THD","sourcePdf":"tcsii-yu-2173973-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046826S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"6129932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6129932","articleId":"6082429","onlineDate":"16 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6082445,"authors":[{"name":"Asiya Khan","affiliation":["Centre for Signal Processing and Multimedia Communication, School of Computing and Mathematics, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6170997/6082445/6082445-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Asiya Khan received the B.Eng. degree (Hons) in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K., in 1992, the M.Sc. degree in communication, control, and digital signal processing from Strathclyde University, Glasgow, in 1993, and the Ph.D. degree in multimedia communication from the University of Plymouth, Plymouth, U.K.","She worked with British Telecommunication Plc from 1993 to 2002 in a management capacity developing various products and seeing them from inception through to launch.

The success of video applications over UMTS networks very much depends on meeting the QoE requirements of users. Thus, it is highly desirable to be able to predict and, if appropriate, to control video quality to meet such QoE requirements. Video quality is affected by distortions caused both by the encoder and the UMTS access network. The impact of these distortions is content dependent, but this feature is not widely used in non-intrusive video quality prediction models. In the new model, we chose four key parameters that can impact video quality and hence the QoE-content type, sender bitrate, block error rate and mean burst length. The video quality was predicted in terms of the mean opinion score (MOS). Subjective quality tests were carried out to develop and evaluate the model. The performance of the model was evaluated with unseen dataset with good prediction accuracy ( ~ 93%). The model also performed well with the LIVE database which was recently made available to the research community. We illustrate the application of the new model in a novel QoE-driven adaptation scheme at the pre-encoding stage in a UMTS network. Simulation results in NS2 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptation scheme, especially at the UMTS access network which is a bottleneck. An advantage of the model is that it is light weight (and so it can be implemented for real-time monitoring), and it provides a measure of user-perceived quality, but without requiring time-consuming subjective tests. The model has potential applications in several other areas, including QoE control and optimization in network planning and content provisioning for network/service providers.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2011.2176324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170997","startPage":"431","endPage":"442","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/6170997/06082445.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2011.2176324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoE Prediction Model and its Application in Video Quality Adaptation Over UMTS Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","3G mobile communication","Predictive models","Adaptation models","Bit rate","Mathematical model","Analysis of variance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","quality of service","radio access networks","video coding","video communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of experience prediction model","video quality adaptation","Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems","UMTS networks","H.264 encoded videos","sender bitrate","block error rate","mean burst length","mean opinion score","subjective quality tests","LIVE database","pre-encoding stage","NS2 simulation","UMTS access network","realtime monitoring","user-perceived quality","network planning","content provisioning","nonintrusive video quality prediction models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Content types","MOS","non-intrusive model","NS2","QoE","UMTS","video quality prediction and adaptation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"QoE Prediction Model and its Application in Video Quality Adaptation Over UMTS Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082445/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6082445/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12615287","publicationDate":"April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoE Prediction Model and its Application in Video Quality Adaptation Over UMTS Networks","sourcePdf":"tmm-khan-2176324-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140689S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6170997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"6170997","articleId":"6082445","onlineDate":"16 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6082448,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Kavehei","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Adelaide, SA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/6165493/6082448/6082448-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Omid Kavehei (S\u201905) received the M.Eng. degree in computer systems engineering from the National University of Iran, Tehran, Iran, in 2005.

Among these technologies, Resistive Memories (ReRAM) created new possibilities because of their nanofeatures and unique \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">I</i>\n-\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V</i>\n characteristics. One particular problem that limits the maximum array size is interference from neighboring cells due to sneak-path currents. A possible device level solution to address this issue is to implement a memory array using complementary resistive switches (CRS). Although the storage mechanism for a CRS is fundamentally different from what has been reported for memristors (low and high resistances), a CRS is simply formed by two series bipolar memristors with opposing polarities. In this paper, our intention is to introduce modeling principles that have been previously verified through measurements and extend the simulation principles based on memristors to CRS devices and, hence, provide an analytical approach to the design of a CRS array. The presented approach creates the necessary design methodology platform that will assist designers in implementation of CRS devices in future systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analytical Approach for Memristive Nanoarchitectures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2011.2174802","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/6165493/06082448.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2011.2174802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165493","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082448","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082448/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"An Analytical Approach for Memristive Nanoarchitectures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6082448/","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12578104","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytical Approach for Memristive Nanoarchitectures","sourcePdf":"tnano-kavehei-2174802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112175S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6165493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6165493","articleId":"6082448","onlineDate":"16 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6082449,"authors":[{"name":"Jee-Yeon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/6165493/6082449/6082449-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jee-Yeon Kim received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2009 and 2011, respectively, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in the Department of Electrical Engineering.","Her research interests include biosensors and nanowire electronics."]},"firstName":"Jee-Yeon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37579250300"},{"name":"Jae-Hyuk Ahn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/6165493/6082449/6082449-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jae-Hyuk Ahn received the B.S. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2007, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in the same department.","His research interests include biosensors, nanofabrication technology, and characterization."]},"firstName":"Jae-Hyuk","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37403230700"},{"name":"Sung-Jin Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/6165493/6082449/6082449-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Sung-Jin Choi received the B.S. degree in electronics and electrical engineering from Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2007, and the M.S. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2008, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the same department.","His current research interests include Schottky-barrier devices, capacitor-less DRAM, biosensors, and nanowire electronics."]},"firstName":"Sung-Jin","lastName":"Choi","id":"37310419800"},{"name":"Maesoon Im","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/6165493/6082449/6082449-photo-4-source-small.gif","p":["Maesoon Im received the B.S.

We propose an acceleration technique for GEMM based on dynamically adjusting the imprecision (distortion) of computation. Our technique employs adaptive scalar companding and rounding to input matrix blocks followed by two forms of packing in floating-point that allow for concurrent calculation of multiple results. Since the adaptive companding process controls the increase of concurrency (via packing), the increase in processing throughput (and the corresponding increase in distortion) depends on the input data statistics. To demonstrate this, we derive the optimal throughput-distortion control framework for GEMM for the broad class of zero-mean, independent identically distributed, input sources. Our approach converts matrix multiplication in programmable processors into a computation channel: when increasing the processing throughput, the output noise (error) increases due to: (i) coarser quantization; and (ii) computational errors caused by exceeding the machine-precision limitations. We show that, under certain distortion in the GEMM computation, the proposed framework can significantly surpass 100% of the peak performance of a given processor. The practical benefits of our proposal are shown in a face recognition system and a multilayer perceptron system trained for metadata learning from a large music feature database.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082463/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2011","volume":"60","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"12590655","publicationDate":"April 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082463/","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Throughput-Distortion Computation of Generic Matrix Multiplication: Toward a Computation Channel for Digital Signal Processing Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput-Distortion Computation of Generic Matrix Multiplication: Toward a Computation Channel for Digital Signal Processing Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-andreopoulos-2176337-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08152S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6165492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6165492","articleId":"6082463","onlineDate":"16 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6082464,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Shi","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Shi","id":"37533992800"},{"name":"Xuejun Sha","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xuejun","lastName":"Sha","id":"37294263700"},{"name":"Qinyu Zhang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Qinyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37289942300"},{"name":"Naitong Zhang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Naitong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288734600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6082464","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":826},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Extrapolation","Convergence","Transforms","Wave functions","Convolution","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","extrapolation","Fourier transforms","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear canonical transform domain","signal processing","LCT bandlimited signal extrapolation","signal expansion","generalized prolate spheroidal wave functions","GPSWF","series truncation","Gerchberg-Papoulis algorithm","GP algorithm","convergence algorithm","Fourier bandlimited signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandlimited signals","linear canonical transform","prolate spheroidal wave functions","signal extrapolation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082464","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2176338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2176338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146821","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6146821/06082464.pdf","startPage":"1502","endPage":"1508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extrapolation of Bandlimited Signals in Linear Canonical Transform Domain","abstract":"The linear canonical transform (LCT) has been shown to be a powerful analyzing tool in signal processing. Many results of this transform are already known, including bandlimited extrapolation. The existing algorithm for solving the problem of LCT bandlimited extrapolation is based on signal expansion into a series of generalized prolate spheroidal wave functions (GPSWFs). However, the requirement to compute and store the GPSWFs and the errors due to the series truncation render this algorithm ill-suitable for a practical implementation. In this correspondence, we first propose a new formulation of the Gerchberg-Papoulis (GP) algorithm for LCT bandlimited extrapolation. Then, we present a fast convergence algorithm for the new formulation. The classical GP algorithm related to Fourier bandlimited signals is noted as a special case. Moreover, the comparison between the proposed algorithm and the one based on GPSWFs expansion is provided, and the validity of the theoretical derivations is demonstrated via simulations. Several potential applications of the achieved theory are also presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6082464/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12527104","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Extrapolation of Bandlimited Signals in Linear Canonical Transform Domain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extrapolation of Bandlimited Signals in Linear Canonical Transform Domain","sourcePdf":"tsp-shi-2176338-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087602S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6146821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6146821","articleId":"6082464","onlineDate":"16 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6082465,"authors":[{"name":"St\u00e9phan Tassart","affiliation":["ST-Ericsson, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6146821/6082465/6082465-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["St\u00e9phan Tassart was born in France in 1970.

The designer chooses the sample rate conversion (SRC) technology based on objective criteria, such as figures of complexity, development or integration cycle and of course performance characterization. The performances of the fractional SRC system include the in-band and the aliasing characterization plus its distortion behavior due to internal rounding errors. The paper shows the existence of a new compound time-invariant system made of multiple instances of the same SRC system. The characterization of the original SRC is obtained from the linear and distortion characteristics of this time-invariant system. Regular methods for characterizing time-invariant systems apply. The SRC system can be analyzed in black box conditions, either in batch processing or in real-time processing. Examples illustrate the capability of the method to fully recover characteristics and rounding noise behavior from actual SRC implementations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6082465/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12527105","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time-Invariant Context for Sample Rate Conversion Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Invariant Context for Sample Rate Conversion Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-tassart-2176336-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064237S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6146821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6146821","articleId":"6082465","onlineDate":"16 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6082466,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoying Gan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6129945/6082466/6082466-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoying Gan (M'08) received the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), Shanghai, China, in 2006.","From 2009 to 2010, she was a Visiting Researcher with the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, University of California, San Diego.

The situation is different under multiuser transmission, where only the number of transmit antennas limits the multiplexing gain. The system therefore has the choice between sending one stream per scheduled user (i.e., combining receive antennas for diversity) or selecting a smaller number of users and multiplex multiple streams to each of them. This tradeoff is investigated herein, based on zero-forcing (with receive antenna combining) and block-diagonalization pre-coding which represents the two extremes. Based on asymptotic analysis and numerical examples, the unexpected conclusion is that each user only should receive one stream and use its antennas to achieve a receive combining gain. This is explained by zero-forcing having a stronger resilience towards spatial correlation and larger benefit from multiuser diversity. This fundamental result has positive implications for the design of multiuser systems as it reduces the hardware constraints at the user devices.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Swedish Communication Technologies Workshop (Swe-CTW)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6072945/6082472/06082475.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"108","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Swedish Communication Technologies Workshop (Swe-CTW)","doi":"10.1109/Swe-CTW.2011.6082475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Swe-CTW.2011.6082475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082472","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receive combining vs. multistream multiplexing in multiuser MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Multiplexing","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Channel estimation","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","multiplexing","numerical analysis","precoding","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multistream multiplexing","multiuser MIMO systems","single-user transmission","receive antennas","multiuser transmission","transmit antennas","zero-forcing precoding","block-diagonalization precoding","asymptotic analysis","numerical examples","multiuser diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Receive combining vs. multistream multiplexing in multiuser MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082475/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377625","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receive combining vs. multistream multiplexing in multiuser MIMO systems","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p103bjornson.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136666S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6072945","isNumber":"6082472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6072945","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6082472","articleId":"6082475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6082486,"authors":[{"name":"Hien Quoc Ngo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hien Quoc","lastName":"Ngo","id":"38231185300"},{"name":"Trung Q.

We derive an exact closed-form expression for the uplink rate per user. We further study the asymptotic performance of the system. We show that, at high signal-to-noise ratio, the system is interference-limited and hence, we cannot improve the system performance by increasing the transmit power at each user. Instead, by increasing the number of base station antennas, the effects of interference and noise can be reduced, thereby improving the system performance. In particular, we show that, with very large antenna arrays at the base station, the transmit power of each user can be made inversely proportional to the number of base station antennas while maintaining a desired quality-of-service.

The fixed relay network is modeled as a virtual oligopoly market, and the Cournot game model is exploited in order to solve the resource allocation problem. Two different types of Cournot competition, namely static and dynamic, are discussed. For the latter case, the stability conditions are analyzed. By using the proposed scheme, the source purchases the optimum amount of bandwidth from each relay, given a specific budget; therefore, the scarce wireless resources are exploited efficiently. Moreover, as the only required signaling among the nodes is the price and the required amount of bandwidth, the feedback and signaling overhead is minimized.

One of the challenges for New Generation Networks (NGN) is then the reduction of energy consumption, in particular at the BSs (Base Stations) which use about 85% of the total network energy. We contribute to the research with a mathematical model that calculates the total power consumption of a BS and enlightens the way to minimize it. First, we analyze the power consumed at every different component of the BS. Second, based on the cost incurred in turning off the BS's power amplifiers, we show how to decide whether it is convenient to keep the BS idle during those intervals in which no traffic has to be sent, or to turn off the amplifiers. Our model is evaluated by means of numerical examples, and shows that interesting power gain can be obtained under a large spectrum of load conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Switches","Cooling","Switching frequency","Mathematical model","Energy consumption","Heating"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","next generation networks","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power consumption minimization","base stations","on-off power amplifiers","fossil fuel","global warming","greenhouse effect","new generation networks","energy consumption reduction","total network energy","mathematical model","total power consumption","BS power amplifiers","power gain","cellular networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GreenCom.2011.6082501","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Online Conference on Green Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Online Conference on Green Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070514/6082499/06082501.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GreenCom.2011.6082501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the minimization of power consumption in base stations using on/off power amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the minimization of power consumption in base stations using on/off power amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082501/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082501/","accessionNumber":"12386105","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the minimization of power consumption in base stations using on/off power amplifiers","confLoc":"(Online Conference) Piscataway, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p18chatzipapas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047599S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070514","isNumber":"6082499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070514","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6082499","articleId":"6082501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6082502,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Clarke","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, UK"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Clarke","id":"37283716900"},{"name":"Rodrigo C. de Lamare","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, UK"],"firstName":"Rodrigo C.","lastName":"de Lamare","id":"37266614000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9519-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9518-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6082502","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"abstract":"This paper presents joint transmit diversity selection (TDS) and relay selection (RS) algorithms based on discrete stochastic optimization for a multi-relay cooperative MIMO system. A two-phase, decode-and-forward (DF) network with a non-negligible direct path is considered where linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers are used at all nodes. TDS and RS are performed jointly with continuous least squares channel estimation and no transmit preprocessing is required. RS removes relays from consideration by TDS and generates an optimized set from which TDS is made, improving the convergence, performance, complexity and energy consumption of the TDS process whilst maintaining low feedback requirements. The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated via mean square error (MSE), bit-error rate (BER) and complexity comparisons. The results show that the proposed schemes outperform cooperative transmission with and without TDS in terms of diversity, MSE and BER, and match that of the optimum exhaustive solutions whilst making considerable complexity and energy savings.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Online Conference on Green Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070514/6082499/06082502.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"29","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Online Conference on Green Communications","doi":"10.1109/GreenCom.2011.6082502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GreenCom.2011.6082502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082499","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint MMSE transmit diversity optimization and relay selection for cooperative MIMO systems using discrete stochastic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Optimization","Complexity theory","Vectors","Bit error rate","MIMO","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","error statistics","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","optimisation","radio receivers","relays","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint MMSE transmit diversity optimization","relay selection algorithm","discrete stochastic algorithm","TDS algorithm","RS algorithm","multirelay cooperative MIMO system","two-phase decode-and-forward network","two-phase DF network","nonnegligible direct path","minimum mean square error receiver","continuous least square channel estimation","transmit preprocessing","energy consumption","bit-error rate","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative systems","MIMO relaying","MMSE","relay selection","transmit diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Joint MMSE transmit diversity optimization and relay selection for cooperative MIMO systems using discrete stochastic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082502/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386106","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint MMSE transmit diversity optimization and relay selection for cooperative MIMO systems using discrete stochastic algorithms","confLoc":"(Online Conference) Piscataway, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p24clarke.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1174S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070514","isNumber":"6082499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070514","xplore-issue":"6082499","articleId":"6082502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6082504,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In a macro site, radio equipment dominates the power consumption. Specifically, the power amplifiers consume 70% of the total input power. In case of WCDMA and OFDMA, the Traditional Power Amplifier (TPA) suffers from low efficiency due to the non-constant envelope signals. To improve efficiency in case of these kinds of signals, deployment of Envelope Tracking Power Amplifier (ET-PA) is a viable solution. In this paper, the efficiency vs. output power characteristics of the ET-PA has been modeled. Moreover, by carrying out system level simulation in WCDMA network scenario, we show that 7-15% energy can be saved by replacing TPA by ET-PA.","doi":"10.1109/GreenCom.2011.6082504","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Online Conference on Green Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Online Conference on Green Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070514/6082499/06082504.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GreenCom.2011.6082504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of efficient power amplifiers in wireless access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082504/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of efficient power amplifiers in wireless access","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386108","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082504/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of efficient power amplifiers in wireless access","confLoc":"(Online Conference) Piscataway, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p36hossain.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07754S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070514","isNumber":"6082499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070514","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6082499","articleId":"6082504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6082506,"authors":[{"name":"Shengrong Bu","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Shengrong","lastName":"Bu","id":"37544252700"},{"name":"F.

Real-time pricing is an important demand-side management mechanism for improving smart grid reliability through dynamically changing or shifting the electricity consumption of users. Presently, the dynamic real-time pricing research in the smart grid mainly focuses on the interactions between a single utility company/retailer and its users. In this paper, we consider electricity liberalization, where more than one electricity retailer can co-exist in each region, and the retailers compete or cooperate with each other to achieve the highest individual or combined revenue. Two types of electricity users are considered in this paper: traditional electricity users who pay a fixed price and opportunistic electricity users who may change the electricity demand or even turn to another electricity retailer. Two game formulations are described for the proposed real-time pricing scheme. One formulation is proposed for a totally competitive environment. Another game formulation is proposed for a cooperative environment. Some simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed real-time pricing scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082506/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12386110","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082506/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic pricing for demand-side management in the smart grid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic pricing for demand-side management in the smart grid","confLoc":"(Online Conference) Piscataway, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p47bu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044185S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070514","isNumber":"6082499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070514","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6082499","articleId":"6082506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6082512,"authors":[{"name":"Alessio Zappone","affiliation":["Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni (CNIT), University of Cassino, Cassino, Frosinone, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Zappone","id":"37399768400"},{"name":"Giuseppa Alfano","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppa","lastName":"Alfano","id":"37269912400"},{"name":"Stefano Buzzi","affiliation":["Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni (CNIT), University of Cassino, Cassino, Frosinone, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Buzzi","id":"37268082600"},{"name":"Michela Meo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Michela","lastName":"Meo","id":"37269524300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9519-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9518-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6082512","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":553},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Resource management","Receiving antennas","Interference","Power control","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","game theory","mobile antennas","OFDM modulation","power control","resource allocation","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient noncooperative resource allocation scheme","multicell uplink OFDMA systems","multiple base station antennas","user energy efficiency","transmit power control","joint subcarrier allocation","noncooperative energy-efficient power control game","network energy efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","multiple antennas","power control","subcarrier assignment","energy efficiency","game theory"]}],"abstract":"The problem of non-cooperative resource allocation in multi-cell uplink OFDMA systems with multiple base station antennas is considered in this paper.

First a non-cooperative energy-efficient power control game is devised, and then the theory of potential games is employed to come up with a non-cooperative game for joint subcarrier and power allocation.

We provide a power budget model that reflects the power expenditure of a base station, that even accounts for the power used for training which enables channel information at the transmitter.

For systems based on diagonal pilots, by using the conventional timing estimation method which is proposed by Hsieh and Wei, the estimation performance can be degraded due to the relatively large pilot distance in the frequency selective fading channel. Therefore, we propose a new fine timing synchronization method, which is based on symbol accumulation with phase interpolation, and that can reduce the effect of frequency selectivity and frequency offset. By mathematical analysis and simulation, we verified that the proposed method can achieve better performance than conventional method in large frequency selective fading environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"ICTC 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069691/6082527/06082539.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"ICTC 2011","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2011.6082539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2011.6082539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An enhanced fine timing synchronization method for diagonal pilot OFDM system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Estimation","Synchronization","Interpolation","Indexes","Channel models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","interpolation","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced fine timing synchronization method","diagonal pilot OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","conventional timing estimation method","frequency selective fading channel","symbol accumulation","phase interpolation","frequency offset","mathematical analysis","mathematical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fine timing","estimation","diagonal","pilot","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082539/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An enhanced fine timing synchronization method for diagonal pilot OFDM system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082539/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12385920","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An enhanced fine timing synchronization method for diagonal pilot OFDM system","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054671S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069691","isNumber":"6082527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069691","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6082527","articleId":"6082539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6082551,"authors":[{"name":"Sungyoon Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungyoon","lastName":"Cho","id":"37293573600"},{"name":"Hyukjin Chae","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyukjin","lastName":"Chae","id":"37692110800"},{"name":"Dongku Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongku","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279322500"},{"name":"Janghoon Yang","affiliation":["Department of Newmedia, Korean German Institute of Technology (KGIT), Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Janghoon","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406103400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1268-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1267-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1266-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1241"}],"articleNumber":"6082551","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":414},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Macrocell networks","MIMO","Interference channels","System performance","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","frequency allocation","interference suppression","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference alignment","range expansion","heterogeneous MIMO network","zero-forcing","heterogeneous cellular system","multiple antennas","transmission strategy","cross-tier interference","macro/picocells network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["interference alignment","zero-forcing","MIMO","range expansion","heterogeneous networks"]}],"abstract":"Managing smaller cells such as micro and picocells in conventional macro cellular networks is expected to provide better quality of data service.

This paper proposes an interference avoidance scheme based on interference alignment and region based zero-forcing in a heterogeneous cellular system consisting of two overlaying macro and picocells with multiple antennas. The proposed transmission strategy effectively suppresses the cross-tier interference at both macro and pico users who are in severe interference limited region, providing the benefits of coverage expansion of picoocells. Simulation results show that the proposed interference avoidance scheme provides a significant performance gain over the non-coordinated scheme in the two macro/picocells network.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2011.6082551","publicationTitle":"ICTC 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"ICTC 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069691/6082527/06082551.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2011.6082551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference alignment with range expansion in a heterogeneous MIMO network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082551/","displayDocTitle":"Interference alignment with range expansion in a heterogeneous MIMO network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12385932","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082551/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference alignment with range expansion in a heterogeneous MIMO network","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1C3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048183S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069691","isNumber":"6082527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069691","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6082527","articleId":"6082551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6082555,"authors":[{"name":"Anh-Duy Vu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Kookmin University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Anh-Duy","lastName":"Vu","id":"37850461300"},{"name":"Jung-Hun Oh","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineer, Kookmin University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Hun","lastName":"Oh","id":"38007507200"},{"name":"Jea-Il Han","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Kookmin University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jea-Il","lastName":"Han","id":"37854763400"},{"name":"Young-Man Kim","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Kookmin University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Man","lastName":"Kim","id":"37859339700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1268-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1267-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1266-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1241"}],"articleNumber":"6082555","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar tracking","MIMO","Target tracking","Doppler radar","Doppler effect","Radar antennas","Radar cross section"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler radar","MIMO radar","radar detection","radar tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detection and tracking system","MIMO Doppler radar sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["The Doppler Effect","continuous wave Doppler sensor","tracking system","Multiple-Input-and-Multiple-Output (MIMO) antenna system","range detection"]}],"abstract":"We describe a system that can track a moving object in the range of 40 meters by using two MIMO Doppler radar sensors.

Therefore, inter-symbol interference (ISI) induced by multipath dispersion that results from optical signals passing through more than one path critically influences the performance of optical wireless (OW) communications. In this paper, we propose the adaptive MMSE equalizer scheme to suppress the multipath ISI, since this scheme can minimize the mean square error (MSE) between the desired equalizer output and the actual equalizer output.

outdoor environment light emitting diodes-identification (LED-ID) systems, the provision of real-time location information to mobile users has become an active area of research. Visible light communication (VLC) in a LED-ID system offers the promise of a safe, efficient, reliable, and environmentally friendly ID technique. However, there are still several problems associated with such a combination, especially optical multipath dispersion, which has a severe impact on the communication performance. In this paper, we simulated a realistic optical channel in outdoor environment and modeled it as a Rician channel. Based on such a channel model, we further proposed an effective scheme of STBC-OFDM to solve the severe optical multipath dispersion problem and to obtain a target BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n at a low SNR, where the received optical signals suffer from deep optical path loss over a long propagation distance.

In our scheme, the user equipment (UE) is capable of receiving the desired signal from the serving femtocell base station (fBS) as well as from an adjacent fBS. Thus, the UE achieves an improved signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) by using two time synchronized signals. Performances of the proposed scheme are evaluated in terms of the call-level quality of service (QoS) (i.e., call blocking probability) and the packet-level QoS (i.e., outage probability). We first measure the resource utilization and call blocking probability for the downlink resources for various offered load in femtocell. Based on that, we obtain the outage probability and effective throughput of the system via computer simulations. Simulation results show that compared to the conventional scheme, the proposed scheme can reduce the UE's outage probability in the enterprise femtocell environment. In particular, a significant performance improvement can be achieved with the proposed CTS for UEs located at the cell edge.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of LTE enterprise femtocell using cooperative downlink transmission scheme","publicationTitle":"ICTC 2011","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2011.6082577","displayPublicationTitle":"ICTC 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069691/6082527/06082577.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2011.6082577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of LTE enterprise femtocell using cooperative downlink transmission scheme","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082577/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12385958","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of LTE enterprise femtocell using cooperative downlink transmission scheme","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05755S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069691","isNumber":"6082527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069691","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6082527","articleId":"6082577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6082578,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Zaman Chowdhury","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Kookmin University, Korea","Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Korea"],"firstName":"Mostafa Zaman","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"37535088600"},{"name":"Seung Que Lee","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Korea"],"firstName":"Seung Que","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281131400"},{"name":"Byung Han Ru","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Daejeon, KR"],"firstName":"Byung Han","lastName":"Ru","id":"37087069560"},{"name":"Namhoon Park","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Korea"],"firstName":"Namhoon","lastName":"Park","id":"37280158600"},{"name":"Yeong Min Jang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Kookmin University, Korea"],"firstName":"Yeong Min","lastName":"Jang","id":"37536259400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1268-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1267-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1266-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1241"}],"articleNumber":"6082578","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":525},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Vehicles","Satellites","Wireless communication","Throughput","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","indoor radio","quality of service","radiofrequency interference","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile femtocell network deployment","service quality improvement","mobile users","vehicular environment","femto-access-point","cellular base station","signal quality","indoor users","wireless networks","signal-to-noise","interference problem","core network","macrocellular networks","satellite access networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile femtocell","vehicle","throughput","SNIR","outage probability","macrocellular networks","femtocellular network"]}],"abstract":"The femto-access-point (FAP), a low power small cellular base station provides better signal quality for the indoor users.

The femtocells are deployed in the vehicular environment. Short distance between the user and the FAP provides better signal quality. The inside FAPs are connected to the core network through the outside macrocellular networks or the satellite networks. One stronger transceiver is installed at outside the vehicle. This transceiver is connected to FAPs using wired connection and to macrocellular or the satellite access networks through wireless link. The capacity and the outage probability are analyzed.

The performance degradations by feedback delay and by using codebook-based BF are analyzed according to the channel gain difference. As the most complexity-reduced alternative, selective power allocation (PA) is also compared with the full feedback-based BF and the codebook-based BF. Based on the results, we note several distinguishable behavior of the distributed BF compared to the clustered BF. 1) Large differences among the channel gains (most typical scenario of distributed BF) suppress the feedback delay effect on performance degradation compared to the case of no differences among the channel gains (similar to the case of clustered BF). 2) However, performance degradation by codebook-based BF becomes more severe in the case of large differences among the channel gains compared to the case of small differences among the channel gains irrespective of feedback delay. With large differences among the channel gains, codebook-based BF gets even worse than the selective PA in distributed BF. 3) For the case of large differences among the channel gains, selective PA is a good alternative to the full feedback-based BF. However, this is only for the case of small feedback delay. The performance gap becomes non-negligible as the feedback delay increases. On the other hand, for the case of no or small channel gain differences, selective PA is a good alternative to the full feedback-based BF as the feedback delay increases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082607/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12385988","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082607/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Effect of feedback delay and channel gain difference on distributed beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of feedback delay and channel gain difference on distributed beamforming","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"5A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05182S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069691","isNumber":"6082527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069691","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6082527","articleId":"6082607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6082608,"authors":[{"name":"Jinwoo Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinwoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"38240964500"},{"name":"In S.

In order to reoBect PAPR as well as multiple access interference (MAI) on the overall performance, we simulate symbol error rates according to various values of two parameters, i.e., the linear power amplification limit of mobile terminals and the timing offset range among the users. Interestingly, it is shown that even with outstanding PAPR performance, the sparse block SC-FDMA cannot beat the ZCZ code time-spread OFDMA in quasi-synchronous environments because of significantly increasing MAI with increasing timing offset. Meanwhile, the latter has almost no MAI even with timing offsets up to one OFDM symbol duration while the degradation due to larger PAPR compared to the former is acceptable in the practical limit of linear power amplification region.","displayPublicationTitle":"ICTC 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069691/6082527/06082629.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"421","publicationTitle":"ICTC 2011","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2011.6082629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2011.6082629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink OFDMA schemes for loose multi-user synchronization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Peak to average power ratio","Bit error rate","Frequency division multiaccess","Noise measurement","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink OFDMA schemes","loose multiuser synchronization","tight multiuser synchronization","sparse block single carrier frequency division multiple access","zero correlation zone code time-spread OFDMA","PAPR","multiple access interference","symbol error rates","linear power amplification limit","mobile terminals","timing offset range","sparse block SC-FDMA","quasisynchronous environments","OFDM symbol duration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Uplink OFDMA schemes for loose multi-user synchronization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082629/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink OFDMA schemes for loose multi-user synchronization","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"6A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090631S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069691","isNumber":"6082527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069691","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6082527","articleId":"6082629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6082632,"authors":[{"name":"Titiek Suryani","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Titiek","lastName":"Suryani","id":"38230389900"},{"name":"Gamantyo Hendrantoro","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Gamantyo","lastName":"Hendrantoro","id":"37392904500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1268-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1267-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1266-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1241"}],"articleNumber":"6082632","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":414},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Doppler shift","Channel estimation","Transmitters","Linear approximation","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","channel estimation","Doppler shift","equalisers","error statistics","frequency-domain analysis","intercarrier interference","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","piecewise linear techniques","radio receivers","radio transmitters","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile terminal velocity","transmitter end","receiver end","Doppler frequency","inter-carrier-interference","OFDM system","channel estimation technique","piecewise linear approximation","ICI mitigation technique","frequency-domain-equalizer","FEQ","normalized maximum Doppler shift","carrier-frequency offset compensation technique","CFO compensation technique","linear channel estimation","CFO compensation frequency","transmitter Doppler shift","mobile-to-fixed channels","mobile-to-mobile channels","linear approximation technique","normalized Doppler spread","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Doppler","ICI","CFO compensation","channel estimation","linear piece-wise","high-speed"]}],"abstract":"In mobile-to-mobile channels, the Doppler shift is affected by mobile terminal velocities of the transmitter and the receiver end. Hence, the Doppler frequency becomes very high if both terminals move very fast. In this condition, the channel will change rapidly and cause large inter-carrier-interference (ICI) in OFDM system. A channel estimation technique using piece-wise linear approximation has previously been developed for ICI mitigation technique employing frequency-domain-equalizer (FEQ). Unfortunately, this channel estimation technique is limited by normalized maximum Doppler shift of 0.2, below which a negligible error results. In this paper, the carrier-frequency offset (CFO) compensation technique is proposed to improve this ICI mitigation technique, so that linear channel estimation still works well although normalized maximum Doppler shift is larger than 0.2.

In this paper, a resource allocation algorithm for the downlink of a multi-user OFDM-based CR system is presented.

However, interference due to the sharing of common radio channels among links and congestion due to the contention among those flows that share the same link become an obstacle to meet this challenge. How to control congestion efficiently and allocate power as well as channel optimally in order to obtain a high end-to-end throughput motivates a framework of cross-layer optimization design for OFDMA-based multi-hop CRNs. By taking into account the problem of joint rate adaption, power control, and spectrum allocation (JRPS), we propose a new cross-layer optimization framework.

These techniques avoid unauthorized users to receive or watch the programs. A smart card is widely used to encrypt or decrypt the Control Words (CW) and transfer them back to the STB (Set-Top Box) in order to descramble the scrambled program. Therefore, secure communication between STB and smart card is directly related to the benefit of the service providers and the legal rights of users, while key exchange is the essential part of a secure communication. This paper presents a new secure and efficient key exchange protocol for IPTV service based on a one-way hash function and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm to minimize the complexity of computational costs between the smart card and the STB and fit low-power IPTV broadcasting service environments. Compared with previous schemes, the newly proposed protocol has the following more practical merits: (1) it provides secure session key agreement function by adopting elliptic curve cryptosystem, (2) it can reduce the total execution time and memory requirement due to the elliptic curve cryptography, and (3) it not only is secure against well-known cryptographical attacks but also provides perfect forward secrecy. As a result, the proposed protocol is extremely suitable for use in IPTV broadcasting service environments since it provides security, reliability, and efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2011.6082658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2011.6082658","publicationTitle":"ICTC 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"ICTC 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069691/6082527/06082658.pdf","startPage":"547","endPage":"552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082658/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"ECC-based key exchange protocol for IPTV service","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386038","htmlLink":"/document/6082658/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECC-based key exchange protocol for IPTV service","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"7D1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068222S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069691","isNumber":"6082527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069691","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6082527","articleId":"6082658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6082675,"authors":[{"name":"Gawn-Seok Jang","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gawn-Seok","lastName":"Jang","id":"38231522400"},{"name":"In-Ki Lee","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"In-Ki","lastName":"Lee","id":"38239726700"},{"name":"Dae-Ig Jang","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dae-Ig","lastName":"Jang","id":"38239264500"},{"name":"Deock-Gil Oh","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Deock-Gil","lastName":"Oh","id":"37291870900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1268-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1267-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1266-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1241"}],"articleNumber":"6082675","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Decoding","Bit error rate","Digital video broadcasting","Thyristors","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","digital video broadcasting","error statistics","iterative methods","parity check codes","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DVB-S2 LDPC code","early stopping method","horizontal shuffling scheduling","LLR value","channel adaptive early termination","HSS decoding","iterations","BER performance","log likelihood ratio","digital video broadcasting via satellite"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Early Stopping","LDPC","Layered Decoding","Horizontal Shuffling Schedule","HSS","DVB-S2"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we verify that a horizontal shuffling scheduling (HSS) LDPC decoding scheme makes its LLR value converge faster than a Flooding Scheduling (FS) scheme.

Congestion occurs when demand exceeds available resources and can significantly reduce the capacity of the motorway network at peak times. Reduced capacity results in additional delays, increased environmental pollution and hinders passenger safety. Congestion is observed to cause low but highly volatile speeds resulting in more uncertain journey times (referred to as flow breakdown or stop-and-go behaviour). Ramp metering is intended to control the entry of new flow in such a way as to maintain steady flow on the motorway and to avoid the loss of capacity associated with congestion. The rate of entry of flow is set according to the particular ramp metering strategy. Such strategies have been the subject of much attention in the transport literature. One of the key issues is the trade-off between efficiency and fair use of resources. This is a trade-off that has been considered extensively in the modelling and control of communication networks. This paper adds to recent work on a ramp metering strategy, proportionally fair metering, inspired by rate control mechanisms developed for the Internet. Specifically, we use simulation results to compare proportionally fair metering with a greedy strategy for a linear network with a series of entry points leading towards a single common destination for all the traffic, such as a radial route towards a city centre. Under our modelling assumptions, the greedy strategy is provably optimal for exogenously determined arrival streams of traffic, but it is unfair, in a certain precise sense, between different entry points and may well have perverse and suboptimal consequences if it influences traffic demand. We further consider a network with parallel roads where flows of traffic may have route choice according to the levels of queueing at the individual entry points.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082812","publicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069628/6082792/06082812.pdf","startPage":"490","endPage":"495","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An investigation of proportionally fair ramp metering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An investigation of proportionally fair ramp metering","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6082812/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12385307","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082812/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An investigation of proportionally fair ramp metering","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066011S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069628","isNumber":"6082792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069628","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6082792","articleId":"6082812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6082815,"authors":[{"name":"Erke Shang","affiliation":["College of Mechatronics and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Erke","lastName":"Shang","id":"37901247600"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["College of Mechatronics and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Li","id":"37676295400"},{"name":"Xiangjing An","affiliation":["College of Mechatronics and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xiangjing","lastName":"An","id":"37565563900"},{"name":"Hangen He","affiliation":["College of Mechatronics and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hangen","lastName":"He","id":"37291666400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2197-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2198-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2196-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"6082815","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":738},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Image edge detection","Vehicles","Real time systems","Complexity theory","Hardware","Alarm systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","field programmable gate arrays","Hough transforms","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time lane departure warning system","vision based lane departure warning system","field programmable gate array","FPGA device","driver assistance","DA system","FPGA technology","digital image processing","hardware architecture","single instruction multiple data","SIMD structure","single instruction single data","SISD structure","parallel Hough transform","storage requirement","common roadway scene"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a vision based Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) and its implementation on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device.

The main contributions of this work are threefold: 1) a hardware architecture, which combines Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) structure and Single Instruction Single Data (SISD) structure based on FPGA, is implemented. This architecture is in possession of both efficiency and flexibility. Therefore, it can be employed to handle many vision processing tasks in real time; 2) an improved parallel Hough Transform (HT) is introduced. Compared with traditional HT, we move the origin to the estimated vanishing point, so as to reduce the storage requirements and improve the detection robustness; and 3) a simple and efficient warning strategy is presented which can be implemented on FPGA easily. Experiments illustrate the high performance of the introduced system in various common roadway scenes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time lane departure warning system based on FPGA","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082815","startPage":"1243","endPage":"1248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082792","publicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069628/6082792/06082815.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A real-time lane departure warning system based on FPGA","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082815/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12385310","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time lane departure warning system based on FPGA","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061015S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069628","isNumber":"6082792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069628","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6082792","articleId":"6082815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6082826,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Tehrani Niknejad","affiliation":["Toyota Technological Institute, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Hossein Tehrani","lastName":"Niknejad","id":"37706517800"},{"name":"Seiichi Mita","affiliation":["Toyota Technological Institute, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Seiichi","lastName":"Mita","id":"37323123200"},{"name":"David McAllester","affiliation":["Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, Chicago, IL, US"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"McAllester","id":"37350105800"},{"name":"Takashi Naito","affiliation":["Toyota Central Research & Development Laboratories, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Naito","id":"37344638800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2197-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2198-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2196-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"6082826","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":831},"abstract":"Vehicle detection at night time is a challenging problem due to low visibility and light distortion caused by motion and illumination in urban environments.

Improved performance can be achieved by utilizing information exchange between vehicles through wireless communication besides local sensor measurements. However, wireless communication introduces network-induced effects that may compromise the performance of the CACC system. Therefore, we approach the design of a CACC system from a Networked Control System (NCS) perspective. Network-induced imperfections in a NCS are mainly due to limited bandwidth of the network, multiple nodes sharing the same medium, and other limitations such as transmission delays and losses. Tradeoffs between CACC performance and network specifications need to be made for achieving desired performance under these network-induced constraints. In this paper, we present a NCS modelling framework that incorporates the effect of sample-and-hold and network delays that occur due to wireless communication. Moreover, we employ this model to study the so-called string stability performance of the string in which vehicles are interconnected by a vehicle following control law and a constant time headway spacing policy. Specifically, we study how string stability is affected by network-induced effects such as delays.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082894","publicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069628/6082792/06082894.pdf","startPage":"2051","endPage":"2056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative adaptive cruise control: Tradeoffs between control and network specifications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082894/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative adaptive cruise control: Tradeoffs between control and network specifications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12385389","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082894/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative adaptive cruise control: Tradeoffs between control and network specifications","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071729S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069628","isNumber":"6082792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069628","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6082792","articleId":"6082894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6082897,"authors":[{"name":"Christian L\u00f6per","affiliation":["Institute of Transportation Systems, German AeroSpace Center (DLR), Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"L\u00f6per","id":"37692522300"},{"name":"\u00c1lvaro Catal\u00e1-Prat","affiliation":["Institute of Transportation Systems, German AeroSpace Center (DLR), Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"\u00c1lvaro","lastName":"Catal\u00e1-Prat","id":"38302675200"},{"name":"Jan Gacnik","affiliation":["Institute of Transportation Systems, German AeroSpace Center (DLR), Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Gacnik","id":"37695265600"},{"name":"Jan Schomerus","affiliation":["Institute of Transportation Systems, German AeroSpace Center (DLR), Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Schomerus","id":"37695264800"},{"name":"Frank K\u00f6ster","affiliation":["Institute of Transportation Systems, German AeroSpace Center (DLR), Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"K\u00f6ster","id":"37604815100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2197-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2198-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2196-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"6082897","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082897","abstract":"Introduction of wireless vehicular communication allows for cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure, thus enabling a variety of new ITS use cases [1].

Extrinsic calibration of these heterogeneous sensors is required to fuse information obtained separately by vision sensor and LIDAR in the context of intelligent vehicle. By placing a planar chessboard at different positions and orientations in front of the sensors, the proposed method solves the problem based on 3D reconstruction of the chessboard and geometric constraints between views from the stereovision system and the LIDAR. The three principle steps of the approach are: 3D corner points triangulation, 3D plane least-squares estimation, solving extrinsic parameters by applying a non-linear optimization algorithm based on the geometric constraints. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, experiments based on computer simulation and real data are performed. The proposed approach is also compared with a popular calibration method to show its advantages.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082899","publicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069628/6082792/06082899.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082792","startPage":"797","endPage":"802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D triangulation based extrinsic calibration between a stereo vision system and a LIDAR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3D triangulation based extrinsic calibration between a stereo vision system and a LIDAR","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082899/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12385394","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6082899/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D triangulation based extrinsic calibration between a stereo vision system and a LIDAR","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062901S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069628","isNumber":"6082792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069628","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6082792","articleId":"6082899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6082916,"authors":[{"name":"Sayanan Sivaraman","firstName":"Sayanan","lastName":"Sivaraman","id":"37401581700"},{"name":"Mohan M.

Utilizing a calibrated stereo-vision rig, the proposed approach combines monocular detection with stereo-vision for on-road vehicle localization and tracking for driver assistance. The system initially acquires synchronized monocular frames and calculates depth maps from the stereo rig. The system then detects vehicles in the image plane using an active learning-based monocular vision approach. Using the image coordinates of detected vehicles, the system then localizes the vehicles in real-world coordinates using the calculated depth map. The vehicles are tracked both in the image plane, and in real-world coordinates, fusing information from both the monocular and stereo modalities. Vehicles' states are estimated and tracked using Kalman filtering. Quantitative analysis of tracks is provided. The full system takes 46ms to process a single frame.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082792","startPage":"1249","endPage":"1254","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069628/6082792/06082916.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining monocular and stereo-vision for real-time vehicle ranging and tracking on multilane highways","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6082916/","displayDocTitle":"Combining monocular and stereo-vision for real-time vehicle ranging and tracking on multilane highways","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12385411","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining monocular and stereo-vision for real-time vehicle ranging and tracking on multilane highways","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065115S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069628","isNumber":"6082792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069628","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6082792","articleId":"6082916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6082929,"authors":[{"name":"Xumei Chen","affiliation":["MOE Key Laboratory of Transportation Complex Systems Theory and Technology School of Traffic and Transportation, Beijing Jiaotong University, BJTU, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xumei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37596830700"},{"name":"Shuxia Guo","affiliation":["Beijing General Municipal Engineering Design and Research Institute, Beijing, 100082 China"],"firstName":"Shuxia","lastName":"Guo","id":"38237110300"},{"name":"Lei Yu","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University and Texas Southern University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yu","id":"37593900900"},{"name":"Bruce Hellinga","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Bruce","lastName":"Hellinga","id":"37354393900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2197-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2198-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2196-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"6082929","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":312},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082929","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Smart cards","Forecasting","Kalman filters","Mathematical model","Real time systems","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","smart cards","traffic information systems","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-term forecasting","transit route OD matrix","smart card data","transit route origin-destination matrix","short-term forecasts","mean absolute percentage error","maximum absolute error","dynamic urban transportation management system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forecasting","Transit Route OD Matrix","Kalman Filter","Smart Card Data"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082929","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069628/6082792/06082929.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","startPage":"1513","endPage":"1518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-term forecasting of transit route OD matrix with smart card data","abstract":"This paper presents a short-term forecasting approach on transit route OD (Origin-Destination) matrix using smart card data of buses.

Among others, reinforcement learning algorithms are of interest because they require no explicit model of the environment beforehand and learning happens through trial and error. This property makes them suitable for real control problems like traffic control. Especially when considering the performance of a network where for instance a local ramp-metering controller needs to consider the performance of the network, since limitations needs to be considered, like the maximum permissible queue length, reinforcement learning algorithms are of interest. Here, a local ramp-metering control problem with queuing consideration is taken up and the performance of standard Q-learning algorithm as well as a newly proposed multi-criterion reinforcement learning algorithm is investigated. The experimental analysis confirms that the proposed multi-criterion control approach has the capability to decrease the state-space size and increase the learning speed of controller while improving the quality of solution.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082976","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082976","startPage":"1652","endPage":"1658","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069628/6082792/06082976.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motorway ramp-metering control with queuing consideration using Q-learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Motorway ramp-metering control with queuing consideration using Q-learning","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082976/","accessionNumber":"12385471","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082976/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motorway ramp-metering control with queuing consideration using Q-learning","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056009S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069628","isNumber":"6082792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069628","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6082792","articleId":"6082976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":6082981,"authors":[{"name":"Jeroen Ploeg","affiliation":["TNO, Helmond, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jeroen","lastName":"Ploeg","id":"37546999300"},{"name":"Bart T.

The amplification of velocity disturbances in upstream direction, however, poses limitations to the minimum feasible time gap. String-stable behavior is thus considered an essential requirement for the design of automatic distance control systems, which are needed to allow for safe driving at time gaps well below 1 s. Theoretical analysis reveals that this requirement can be met using wireless inter-vehicle communication to provide real-time information of the preceding vehicle, in addition to the information obtained by common Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) sensors. In order to validate these theoretical results and to demonstrate the technical feasibility, the resulting control system, known as Cooperative ACC (CACC), is implemented on a test fleet consisting of six passenger vehicles. Experiments clearly show that the practical results match the theoretical analysis, thereby indicating the possibilities for short-distance vehicle following.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and experimental evaluation of cooperative adaptive cruise control","publicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082981","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069628/6082792/06082981.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Design and experimental evaluation of cooperative adaptive cruise control","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082981/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12385476","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and experimental evaluation of cooperative adaptive cruise control","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070021S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069628","isNumber":"6082792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069628","citationCount":"257","xplore-issue":"6082792","articleId":"6082981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6082986,"authors":[{"name":"Marius Drulea","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Drulea","id":"37599030000"},{"name":"Sergiu Nedevschi","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Sergiu","lastName":"Nedevschi","id":"37283407700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2197-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2198-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2196-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"6082986","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":862},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical filters","Robustness","Minimization","Computer vision","Optical imaging","Image motion analysis","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","image sequences","motion estimation","numerical analysis","smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["total variation regularization","data fidelity terms","variational optical flow method","estimation robustness","anisotropic smoother","fill-in process","combined local-global optical flow approach","CLG optical flow approach","bilateral filtering","anisotropic regularization","CLG-TV method","numerical scheme","graphic processing units"]}],"abstract":"More data fidelity terms in variational optical flow methods improve the estimation's robustness.

The numerical scheme is highly parallelizable and runs in real-time on current generation graphic processing units.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082986","publicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069628/6082792/06082986.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total variation regularization of local-global optical flow","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6082986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6082986/","displayDocTitle":"Total variation regularization of local-global optical flow","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12385481","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6082986/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total variation regularization of local-global optical flow","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041455S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069628","isNumber":"6082792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069628","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"6082792","articleId":"6082986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6083027,"authors":[{"name":"Yujie Dai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Management of Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yujie","lastName":"Dai","id":"38195166500"},{"name":"Jinzong Hu","affiliation":["Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China"],"firstName":"Jinzong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37897413300"},{"name":"Dongbin Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Management of Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dongbin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37277016800"},{"name":"Fenghua Zhu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Management of Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fenghua","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37655779400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2197-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2198-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2196-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"6083027","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":462},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Training","Vehicles","Roads","Software","Real time systems","Learning systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","delays","energy consumption","fuel economy","large-scale systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","road traffic control","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based online traffic signal controller design","traffic congestion","traffic delays","fuel consumption","traffic flow rate","complex nonlinear stochastic system","computational intelligence technology","CI technology","traffic light control","urban traffic road network","microscopic traffic simulation software","online reinforcement training"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083027","abstract":"Traffic congestion leads to problems like delays, decreasing flow rate, and higher fuel consumption. Consequently, keeping traffic moving as efficiently as possible is not only important to economy but also important to environment. Traffic system is a large complex nonlinear stochastic system. Traditional mathematical methods have some limitations when they are applied in traffic control. Thus, computational intelligence (CI) technologies gain more and more attentions. Neural Networks (NNs) is a well developed CI technology with lots of promising applications in traffic signal control (TSC). In this paper, a neural network (NN) based signal controller is designed to control the traffic lights in an urban traffic road network. Scenarios of simulation are conducted under a microscopic traffic simulation software. Several criterions are collected. Results demonstrate that through online reinforcement training the controllers obtain better control effects than the widely used pre-time and actuated methods under various traffic conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2011.6083027","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069628/6082792/06083027.pdf","startPage":"1045","endPage":"1050","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","publicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2011.6083027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based online traffic signal controller design with reinforcement training","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based online traffic signal controller design with reinforcement training","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12385522","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6083027/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based online traffic signal controller design with reinforcement training","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101907S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069628","isNumber":"6082792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069628","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6082792","articleId":"6083027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6083075,"authors":[{"name":"Zezhi Chen","affiliation":["Digital Imaging Research Centre, School of Computing and Information Systems, Kingston University, Kingston-upon-Thames, UK"],"firstName":"Zezhi","lastName":"Chen","id":"38239048500"},{"name":"Tim Ellis","affiliation":["Digital Imaging Research Centre, School of Computing and Information Systems, Kingston University, Kingston-upon-Thames, UK"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Ellis","id":"37277219900"},{"name":"Sergio A Velastin","affiliation":["Digital Imaging Research Centre, School of Computing and Information Systems, Kingston University, Kingston-upon-Thames, UK"],"firstName":"Sergio A","lastName":"Velastin","id":"37277288800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2197-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2198-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2196-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"6083075","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":799},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083075","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Support vector machines","Solid modeling","Three dimensional displays","Calibration","Motorcycles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","bicycles","motorcycles","support vector machines","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle type categorization","road vehicle classification","view-dependent binary silhouettes","static roadside CCTV camera","camera calibration","Google Earth","scene geometry","manual segmentation","vehicle classes","car","bus","bicycle-motorcycle","feature-based classifiers","SVM","random forests","model-based approach"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2011.6083075","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069628/6082792/06083075.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","startPage":"74","endPage":"79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2011.6083075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle type categorization: A comparison of classification schemes","abstract":"This paper describes research to classify road vehicles into a range of broad categories using simple measures of size and shape derived from view-dependent binary silhouettes using images derived from a static roadside CCTV camera.

Potentially-aggressive driving behavior is currently a leading cause of traffic fatalities in the United States. More often than not, drivers are unaware that they commit potentially-aggressive actions daily. To increase awareness and promote driver safety, we are proposing a novel system that uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and smartphone based sensor-fusion (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, video) to detect, recognize and record these actions without external processing. Our system differs from past driving pattern recognition research by fusing related inter-axial data from multiple sensors into a single classifier. It also utilizes Euler representation of device attitude (also based on fused data) to aid in classification. All processing is done completely on the smartphone.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems

transportation system, the \u201cmicrosimulation\u201d of a traffic system has long been a hot topic in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) research. The Cellular Automata (CA) and the Multi-Agent System (MAS) modeling are two typical methods for the traffic microsimulation. However, the computing burden for the microsimulation and the optimization based on it is usually very heavy. In recent years the Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been applied successfully in many areas for parallel computing. Compared with the traditional CPU cluster, GPU has an obvious advantage of low cost of hardware and electricity consumption. In this paper we build an MAS model for a road network of four signalized intersections and we use a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the traffic signal timing with the objective of maximizing the number of the vehicles leaving the network in a given period of time. Both the simulation and the optimization are accelerated by GPU and a speedup by a factor of 195 is obtained. In the future we will extend the work to large scale road networks.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2011.6083080","startPage":"145","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2011.6083080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082792","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069628/6082792/06083080.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Agent-based traffic simulation and traffic signal timing optimization with GPU","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083080/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Agent-based traffic simulation and traffic signal timing optimization with GPU","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6083080/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12385575","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Agent-based traffic simulation and traffic signal timing optimization with GPU","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073502S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069628","isNumber":"6082792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069628","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6082792","articleId":"6083080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6083084,"authors":[{"name":"Hesham Rakha","affiliation":["Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Hesham","lastName":"Rakha","id":"37354334200"},{"name":"Raj Kishore Kamalanathsharma","affiliation":["Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Raj Kishore","lastName":"Kamalanathsharma","id":"38228655000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2197-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2198-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2196-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"6083084","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":117,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2745},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Fuels","Biological system modeling","Acceleration","Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["V2I communication","eco-driving","vehicle fuel consumption efficiency","vehicle-to-infrastructure communication","fuel consumption"]}],"abstract":"The research presented in this paper develops a framework to enhance vehicle fuel consumption efficiency while approaching a signalized intersection through the provision of signal phase and timing information that may be available through vehicle-to-infrastructure communication.

Its goals are to increase road throughput and optimise the traffic control for increased safety of the participants, reduced fuel consumption and carbon emissions. The urban vehicle control scenario assumes that the speed of each vehicle in the controlled area is set by an off-board control unit that supervises each traffic intersection. The software component responsible for that is called an Intersection Control Service (ICS). From the system's point of view, the vehicles are treated as cloud services and are discovered and invoked using a cloud computing methodology. Geographical multicast addressing is used to target all vehicles in the specified areas. ICSs are part of a city/region wide cloud system that coordinates flow of traffic between intersections. The system's optimisation objective is carried out on several planning planes simultaneously, the lowest being local to a single intersection and the highest being an entire city or region level. The ICS gathers traffic data from various sensors around the intersection, and from the vehicles themselves, creating a dynamic situation map which can be used to assess the road situation and perform short term predictions for vehicle control purposes.","publicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069628/6082792/06083087.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2011.6083087","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2011.6083087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud computing concept for Intelligent Transportation Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cloud computing concept for Intelligent Transportation Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083087/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6083087/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12385582","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud computing concept for Intelligent Transportation Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.152623S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069628","isNumber":"6082792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069628","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6082792","articleId":"6083087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6083088,"authors":[{"name":"Roozbeh Kianfar","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Mechatronics Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Roozbeh","lastName":"Kianfar","id":"38492609500"},{"name":"Paolo Falcone","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Mechatronics Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Falcone","id":"38490920400"},{"name":"Jonas Fredriksson","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Mechatronics Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"Fredriksson","id":"37325597700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2197-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2198-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2196-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"6083088","dbTime":"38 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":629},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Acceleration","Stability criteria","Safety","Time domain analysis","Vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","collision avoidance","control system synthesis","frequency-domain analysis","road vehicles","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receding horizon approach","cooperative adaptive cruise control","time domain approach","acceleration shockwaves","controller design","rear-end collision avoidance","frequency domain approach","predecessor-follower string stability","acceleration signals","road transportation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A receding horizon approach to string stable cooperative adaptive cruise control","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2011.6083088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082792","endPage":"739","publicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069628/6082792/06083088.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2011.6083088","startPage":"734","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083088","abstract":"A time domain approach to a \u201cstring stable\u201d, i.e., capable of attenuating acceleration shockwaves, cooperative adaptive cruise control is proposed in this paper.

The first part of this study extends on a previously developed general architecture for estimation and prediction of hybrid-state systems. The extended system utilizes the hybrid characteristics of decision-behavior coupling of many systems such as the driver and the vehicle; uses Kalman Filter estimates of observable parameters to track the instantaneous discrete state, and predicts the most likely outcome. Prediction of the likely driver state outcome depends on the higher level discrete model and the observed behavior of the continuous subsystem. Two approaches to estimate the discrete driver state from filtered continuous observations are presented: rule based estimation, and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based estimation. Extensions to a prediction application is described through the use of Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (HHMMs). The proposed method is suitable for scenarios that involve unknown decisions of other individuals, such as lane changes or intersection precedence/access. An HMM implementation for multiple tasks of a single vehicle at an intersection is presented along with preliminary results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083095/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12385590","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6083095/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Driver/vehicle state estimation and detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Driver/vehicle state estimation and detection","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048389S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069628","isNumber":"6082792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069628","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6082792","articleId":"6083095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6083116,"authors":[{"name":"I.

However, the algorithm does not take on-ramps into account in its current form, while on-ramp traffic may have an impact of the effectiveness of the algorithm. In this paper we extend the theory of SPECIALIST to include on-ramps and ramp metering. The theory of SPECIALIST is formulated in the framework of shock wave theory and it results in a control scheme that describes the propagation of the fronts (boundaries) between the various traffic states, and describes the time and location where the speed limits need to be active. Here we extend this with the traffic states describing the additional flow from an on-ramp (either metered or not), and develop the resulting control schemes. Since the location of the on-ramp relative to the moving jam and to the control scheme can be categorized into four cases, we develop four different control schemes. The developed control schemes can be used to analyze offline traffic data to assess the number of moving jams that can be resolved. Resolvability basically depends on (1) whether the traffic situation (speeds, flows, etc.) is such that a control scheme can be constructed, and (2) whether the control scheme physically fits on the freeway stretch equipped with variable speed limit displays. As an example, we analyze the data of a stretch on the A2 freeway in the Netherlands for various speed limit values and maximum on-ramp flows. The results show that for the number of resolvable moving jams the fact that the on-ramp flows are taken into account is more important than the metered value of the on-ramp flow.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2011.6083116","publicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069628/6082792/06083116.pdf","startPage":"2154","endPage":"2159","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2011.6083116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SPECIALIST-RM \u2014 Integrated variable speed limit control and ramp metering based on shock wave theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"SPECIALIST-RM \u2014 Integrated variable speed limit control and ramp metering based on shock wave theory","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6083116/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12385611","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083116/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SPECIALIST-RM \u2014 Integrated variable speed limit control and ramp metering based on shock wave theory","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086034S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069628","isNumber":"6082792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069628","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6082792","articleId":"6083116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6083128,"authors":[{"name":"Anup Doshi","affiliation":["Laboratory of Intelligent and Safe Automobiles (cvrr.ucsd.edu/LISA), University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anup","lastName":"Doshi","id":"37541731300"},{"name":"Mohan M.

There is a challenge though in that mobile devices deliver lower performance than traditional less-constrained and non-mobile computers because they are constrained by weight, size, and mobility in spite of all their advancements in recent years. One of the most common solutions that has ameliorated this performance disparity is cyber foraging, wherein nearby non-mobile computers called surrogates are utilized to run the whole or parts of applications on behalf of mobile devices. In this paper, we present a survey of cyber foraging as a solution to resolve the challenges of computing on resource-constrained mobile devices. We also explain the most notable cyber foraging systems and present a categorization of existing cyber foraging approaches considering their type of dynamicity, granularity, metrics used, surrogate types and scale, location of their decision maker unit, remoteness of execution, migration support, and their overheads.","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2011.111411.00016","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/6341161/06083230.pdf","startPage":"1232","endPage":"1243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2011.111411.00016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey and Taxonomy of Cyber Foraging of Mobile Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083230/","displayDocTitle":"A Survey and Taxonomy of Cyber Foraging of Mobile Devices","volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6083230/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey and Taxonomy of Cyber Foraging of Mobile Devices","sourcePdf":"16sharifi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147378S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6341161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6341161","articleId":"6083230","onlineDate":"17 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6083232,"authors":[{"name":"Akbar Ghaffarpour Rahbar","affiliation":["Computer Networks Research Lab, Sahand University of Technology, Tabriz, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6341161/6083232/6083232-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Akbar Ghaffarpour Rahbar is an Associate Professor in Electrical Engineering department at Sa-hand University of Technology, Sahand New Town, Tabriz, Iran.

Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) techniques can be divided into two categories. The first category (pure RWA) concentrates on setting up light-paths under the assumption of an ideal physical layer. However, this assumption could be suitable for opaque networks, where a signal is regenerated at each optical switch along its path. On the other hand, as an optical signal propagates along a light-path to its destination in a transparent (all-optical) network, the signal's quality degrades because there is no signal regeneration, thus increasing Bit-Error-Rate (BER) of the signal. However, users would not accept a light-path with a high BER. Even it is not acceptable if the establishment of a light-path causes the BER of other existing light-paths to become unacceptably high. Therefore, considering physical layer impairments, the quality of a light-path must be checked during the light-path setup in the second category. In this article, the operations of dynamic RWA techniques proposed in transparent networks for the second category are reviewed in detail. These techniques are called Quality of Transmission Aware (QoT-aware) RWA and are grouped in two groups: integrated QoT and RWA, and QoT after Pure RWA. Each group can be further divided into direct modelling and indirect modelling sub-groups. A comprehensive discussion is also provided to compare dynamic QoT-aware RWA techniques based on different network and physical layer parameters.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2011.101911.00023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341161","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/6341161/06083232.pdf","endPage":"1089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Review of Dynamic Impairment-Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment Techniques in All-Optical Wavelength-Routed Networks","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2011.101911.00023","startPage":"1065","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Review of Dynamic Impairment-Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment Techniques in All-Optical Wavelength-Routed Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083232/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2012","publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6083232/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review of Dynamic Impairment-Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment Techniques in All-Optical Wavelength-Routed Networks","sourcePdf":"08rahbar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.271031S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6341161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6341161","articleId":"6083232","onlineDate":"17 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6083498,"authors":[{"name":"Arsenia Chorti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Arsenia","lastName":"Chorti","id":"37294375300"},{"name":"Mike Brookes","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Brookes","id":"37301882500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6083498","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"Phase noise of RF oscillators causes important performance degradation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. In this brief, we provide an analytical evaluation of the effect of Voigt profile oscillators on OFDM. In contrast to existing analyses, we neither use a small-angle approximation nor assume a Wiener phase noise model. Our method allows us to predict the common error (CE) and the intercarrier interference (ICI) from frequency-domain measurements of the spectrum, which are readily accessible, rather than from direct measurement of the phase noise time-domain characteristics. This brief forms the basis of new closed-form expressions for the variances of the induced ICI and CE, directly mapped to real microwave circuit parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/6083463/06083498.pdf","startPage":"768","endPage":"772","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2011.2168011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2011.2168011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083463","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Effect of Voigt Profile Oscillators on OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","OFDM","Approximation methods","Radio frequency","Voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain analysis","intercarrier interference","microwave oscillators","OFDM modulation","phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Voigt profile oscillator effect","OFDM systems","RF oscillators","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","small-angle approximation","Wiener phase noise model","common error prediction","intercarrier interference","frequency-domain measurements","ICI","phase noise time-domain characteristics","closed-form expressions","microwave circuit parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Colored noise","laser noise","microwave oscillators","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation","phase noise","signal to noise ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"On the Effect of Voigt Profile Oscillators on OFDM Systems","volume":"58","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6083498/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12376781","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Effect of Voigt Profile Oscillators on OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tcsii-brookes-2168011-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073716S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"6083463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6083463","articleId":"6083498","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6083556,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas Bonello","affiliation":["Radio frequency communications systems, University of Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Nicholas Bonello (nb06r@ecs.soton.ac.uk) received his B.Eng.

The EQE of solar cells for space applications is adversely affected due to bombardment of charged particles in space. Numerical model based softwares, e.g., PC1D, can be used to estimate the EQE under such situation. By varying the cell parameters to fit the measured EQE one can obtain degradation performance of space solar cells. However, due to complex phenomena and interactions occurring between the junctions of the solar cells and the nonlinear influence of charged particles, the accuracy of these models may be limited. In this paper we propose an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model to estimate the EQE performance of triple junction InGaP/GaAs/Ge solar cells under the influence of wide range of charged particles. With extensive simulation results we have shown that the ANN-based models provide better estimate of the EQE in terms of mean square error and correlation coefficient than the results reported by Sato et al.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083709/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12387334","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6083709/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Estimation of external quantum efficiency for multi-junction solar cells under influence of charged particles using artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of external quantum efficiency for multi-junction solar cells under influence of charged particles using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"0783009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101954S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6083709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6083715,"authors":[{"name":"Yeboon Yun","affiliation":["Kansai University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yeboon","lastName":"Yun","id":"37276085700"},{"name":"Hirotaka Nakayama","affiliation":["Konan University, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirotaka","lastName":"Nakayama","id":"37276080300"},{"name":"Min Yoon","affiliation":["Pukyong National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37302200100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0653-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0652-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0651-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6083715","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data envelopment analysis","evolutionary computation","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary multiobjective optimization","Pareto optimal solution","convergence","recombination method","expected improvement","generalized data envelopment analysis","real-coded multiobjective genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-Objective Optimization","Expected Improvement","Generalized Data Envelopment Analysis","Evolutionary Optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083715","abstract":"Evolutionary optimization methods, for example genetic algorithms have been applied for solving multi-objective optimization problems, and have been observed to be useful for generating Pareto optimal solutions.

Whereas link specific RA problems have been widely investigated in the literature targeting either the uplink or downlink of a communication system, we present in this paper, SIRA, a novel joint uplink/downlink RA scenario in an OFDMA system for users running symmetrical services on their mobile devices. The RA process is modeled as a social gaming paradigm where users are considered as players interacting with the base station which takes the role of a principal controlling the RA game. Intelligently evolving from a soft RA and inspired by the model of team development proposed by Bruce Tuckman, SIRA uses penalty based concepts which play a feedback mechanism role from a system theory perspective to finalize the decision on allocated resources. Simulation results show the merit of the proposed technique and motivate follow on research.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083763","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070513/6083622/06083763.pdf","startPage":"884","endPage":"890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SIRA: A socially inspired game theoretic uplink/downlink resource aware allocation in OFDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083763","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083763/","displayDocTitle":"SIRA: A socially inspired game theoretic uplink/downlink resource aware allocation in OFDMA systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387385","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6083763/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SIRA: A socially inspired game theoretic uplink/downlink resource aware allocation in OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"1493161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076543S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6083763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6083781,"authors":[{"name":"Mong-Fong Horng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Mong-Fong","lastName":"Horng","id":"37267162200"},{"name":"Yi-Ting Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Ting","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600574700"},{"name":"Sin-Man Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sin-Man","lastName":"Zeng","id":"38242275400"},{"name":"Bing-Yi Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Bing-Yi","lastName":"Liao","id":"38230891900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0653-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0652-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0651-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6083781","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083781","abstract":"In this paper, a new genetic algorithm with self-configuration chromosomes for optimization is proposed. In legacy approaches, the chromosomes are with a constant structure. Thus, the search driven by genetic algorithm in solution space is not efficient. In this paper, a scheme of configuring chromosome structure is presented. The chromosome structure is adjusted according to the solution space. The proposed scheme is composed of three phases; solution space analysis, chromosome configuration and genetic operation. Through three phases, the chromosome structure is derived from solution space analysis and is adjusted in iterations to approach the optimal solution. The proposed scheme is applied to find the shortest secure path for people in blaze scene. We deploy a wireless sensor network to collect the temperature distribution in a blaze scene. The proposed genetic algorithm will discover the fleeing path from the measured temperature distribution. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme features (1) effectiveness (2) timeliness and (3) reliability. The developed system also benefits the security and safety of people in business buildings.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083781","startPage":"627","endPage":"632","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070513/6083622/06083781.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new genetic algorithm with self-configuration chromosome to discover optimal fleeing paths in blaze scene","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Fires","Genetic algorithms","Temperature measurement","Wireless sensor networks","Temperature distribution","Temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emergency services","fires","genetic algorithms","temperature distribution","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","self-configuration chromosome","blaze scene","optimal fleeing path discovery","wireless sensor network","solution space analysis phase","chromosome configuration phase","genetic operation phase","legacy approach","temperature distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithm","Self-configuration chromosome","Wireless Sensor Networks","Blaze Rescue","Optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A new genetic algorithm with self-configuration chromosome to discover optimal fleeing paths in blaze scene","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6083781/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387403","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new genetic algorithm with self-configuration chromosome to discover optimal fleeing paths in blaze scene","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"1054274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068386S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6083781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6083798,"authors":[{"name":"Mitsukuni Matayoshi","affiliation":["Department of Industry and Information Science, Okinawa International University, Ginowan, Okinawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsukuni","lastName":"Matayoshi","id":"37424632400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0653-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0652-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0651-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6083798","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083798","abstract":"This paper proposes a new placement method for two dimensional rectilinear polygons.

In non-commercial service scheduling problems, service providers strive to maximize the common welfare of the community through effective scheduling of their services and, at the same time, customers may behave strategically to achieve their individual objectives by not revealing their complete availabilities. This misalignment of objectives between the service provider and the customers leads naturally to the design of market-based scheduling mechanisms. A unique challenge in this non-commercial setting is that monetary payments cannot be involved in the design of the mechanism. We propose a non-price iterative bidding framework which aligns customers' self-interests with the service provider's objective. In addition, the mechanism also accommodates customers' personal preferences. We show that, under the proposed mechanism, myopic bidding is the dominant strategy for customers.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070513/6083622/06083803.pdf","startPage":"1020","endPage":"1025","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bidding without pricing: An iterative bidding mechanism for scheduling non-commercial services","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Bidding without pricing: An iterative bidding mechanism for scheduling non-commercial services","htmlLink":"/document/6083803/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12387425","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bidding without pricing: An iterative bidding mechanism for scheduling non-commercial services","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"1724273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039842S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6083803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6083813,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.F. de Winter","affiliation":["Department of BioMechanical Engineering, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"J.C.F.","lastName":"de Winter","id":"37936526900"},{"name":"D.

With shared control, the driver receives continuous force feedback on the gas pedal or steering wheel, so that human and machine conduct the driving task simultaneously. Experiments in driving simulators have shown that shared control reduces control variability and mental workload, and improves accuracy in path tracking and car following. Crucial to road safety, however, is not whether shared control improves performance in routine driving tasks, but what happens in dangerous situations when a conflict of authority occurs, or when the force feedback cannot be relied upon or is suddenly disengaged. Drawing on research into transfer of training, it is shown that shared control may induce aftereffects and may hamper retention of robust driving skills. Supplementary information should not be provided continuously, but on an as-needed basis, warning or assisting drivers only when deviations from acceptable tolerance limits arise.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083622","startPage":"1050","endPage":"1056","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070513/6083622/06083813.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preparing drivers for dangerous situations: A critical reflection on continuous shared control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6083813/","displayDocTitle":"Preparing drivers for dangerous situations: A critical reflection on continuous shared control","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387435","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preparing drivers for dangerous situations: A critical reflection on continuous shared control","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"1774161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.177078S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6083813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6083826,"authors":[{"name":"Hitham Jleed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Hitham","lastName":"Jleed","id":"38228855800"},{"name":"Sos Agaian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sos","lastName":"Agaian","id":"37266785500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0653-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0652-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0651-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6083826","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Discrete Fourier transforms","DNA","Digital filters","Proteins","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","DNA","encoding","Fourier transform spectra","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coding region prediction","DNA sequences","Fourier spectral characteristics","protein coding region","computer simulation","exon region prediction","intron regions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DNA","Discrete Fourier transforms","indicator sequence","Receiver operating characteristic"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new algorithm based on Fourier spectral characteristics.

Using such a MEMS based monitoring system, several kinds of numerical data from several types of sensors can be measured. Our goal is to develop a intelligent monitoring system with small size. In order to microminiaturize the monitoring system, we need to minimize the power consumption. Therefore, we have to keep our intelligent system simple. We propose a behavior estimation method which consists of a SVM and a fuzzy rule based system to estimate the subject's behavior. Our proposed method consists of two steps of abstraction. First, action primitives are defined. A SVM based classification system is trained using sample numerical data of action primitives. Then, the SVM based system classifies a part of numerical data into one of action primitives. Therefore, whole numerical data are expressed by a sequence of action primitives. Next, a fuzzy rule which maps a sequence of actions onto a behavior is defined for each behavior. In the second-step abstraction, each action sequence is expressed as a behavior by using the defined fuzzy rules. From the results of the abstraction, we can estimate the subject's state.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083831/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6083831/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387453","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Behavior extraction from multiple sensors information for human activity monitoring","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Behavior extraction from multiple sensors information for human activity monitoring","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"1954309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042514S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6083831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6083848,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-Hsin Chou","affiliation":["National Chi-Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Hsin","lastName":"Chou","id":"37285248200"},{"name":"Yi-Jyuan Yang","affiliation":["National Chi-Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Jyuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37599952400"},{"name":"Chia-Hui Chiu","affiliation":["National Chi-Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hui","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37595160500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0653-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0652-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0651-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6083848","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":374},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083848","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantum computing","Evolutionary computation","Maintenance engineering","Heuristic algorithms","Computers","Search problems","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","knapsack problems","quantum computing","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum-inspired tabu search","0/1 knapsack problem","quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm","quantum computation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quantum computing","combinatorial optimization","quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm","tabu search","knapsack problem"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm, called quantum-inspired Tabu search (QTS).

However, the successful management of information security in cloud computing requires certain factors. This study aims to collect Key Success Factors (KSFs) that determine the management information security in cloud computing through literature review and design of a questionnaire survey. This comprises four major aspects: (1) External dimension, (2) Internal dimension, (3) Technology dimension, and (4) Execution dimension. Based on these, we proceed with categorization and analysis using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP or FAHP), which we applied in this study to overcome the seeming failure of general Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) in dealing with respondents' impersonal differences in paired comparison. The objectives under each aspect ranked in order from security function, system, organization, operation, market, legislation, human resource, to mechanism. The results sifted from the FAHP approach suggest six top key success factors: \u201cAuthentication\u201d, \u201cDisclosure Preventing\u201d, \u201cEncryption\u201d, \u201cService Model\u201d, \u201cInterface\u201d, and \u201cCustomer\u201d.

Due to high complexity of the optimum multiuser detector (MUD), suboptimal multiuser detectors with less complexity and reasonable performance have received considerable attention. In this contribution, a Hopfield neural network (HNN)-aided MUD is proposed for employment in DS-UWB system, which is capable of achieving a similar performance to that attained by its optimum MUD-aided counterpart at a significantly lower complexity, especially at high user loads. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed HNN-aided system can be further improved if the proposed electromagnetism-like method (EM) assisted HNN (EMHNN) MUD is employed. We demonstrate that the EMHNN aided system is capable of reducing the bit error rate (BER) by up to four orders of magnitude in comparison to the suboptimal MUDs and the MUDs based on the HNN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083869/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12387491","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6083869/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance of hybrid hopfield neural networks with EM algorithms for multiuser detection in ultra-wide-band communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of hybrid hopfield neural networks with EM algorithms for multiuser detection in ultra-wide-band communication systems","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"2384076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084074S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6083869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6083872,"authors":[{"name":"Tan-Hsu Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tan-Hsu","lastName":"Tan","id":"37085998344"},{"name":"Yung-Fa Huang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Chao Yang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Fa","lastName":"Huang","id":"37335701600"},{"name":"Ling-Cheng Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ling-Cheng","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37401778500"},{"name":"Kuan-Ren Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuan-Ren","lastName":"Lin","id":"37088257500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0653-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0652-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0651-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6083872","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Estimation","Convergence","Diversity reception","Frequency conversion","Particle swarm optimization","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","frequency division multiple access","least squares approximations","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier frequency offset estimation","uplink OFDMA systems","enhanced PSO algorithm","multiple access interference cancellation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","particle swarm optimization algorithm","least square scheme","MRPSO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)","Carrier frequency offset (CFO) multiple access interference (MAI)","Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Least square (LS)"]}],"abstract":"Carrier frequency offset (CFO) is a major factor that degrades performance of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. For orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) uplink systems, there are multiple CFOs need to be estimated simultaneously, which is a very challenging task. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has been recognized a potential approach for CFOs estimation. However, its performance deteriorates as the number of users increases due to insufficient particles diversity. To overcome this difficulty, an enhanced PSO called MRPSO is proposed to increase particles diversity by employing mutation and repulsive operations. Furthermore, a least square (LS) scheme is adopted to improve the estimated CFOs. Simulation results indicate that the proposed MRPSO attains best BER and MSE performances in CFOs estimation as compared to other PSO-based schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier frequency offsets estimation for uplink OFDMA systems using enhanced PSO and multiple access interference cancellation","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083872","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070513/6083622/06083872.pdf","startPage":"1436","endPage":"1441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083622","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083872","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Carrier frequency offsets estimation for uplink OFDMA systems using enhanced PSO and multiple access interference cancellation","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6083872/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387494","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier frequency offsets estimation for uplink OFDMA systems using enhanced PSO and multiple access interference cancellation","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"2404164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078633S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6083872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6083880,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohui Hu","affiliation":["School of physics and telecommunication, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085382119"},{"name":"Lvjun Zhan","affiliation":["School of physics and telecommunication, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lvjun","lastName":"Zhan","id":"37087894091"},{"name":"Yun Xue","affiliation":["School of physics and telecommunication, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Xue","id":"37694194900"},{"name":"Weixing Zhou","affiliation":["School of physics and telecommunication, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Weixing","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085579859"},{"name":"Liangjun Zhang","affiliation":["Guangzhou TIP DM Software co.,ltd., Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liangjun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088307332"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0653-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0652-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0651-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6083880","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083880","abstract":"The paper describes a novel method for discrete speech recognition based on spoken Arabic digit recognition by means of wavelet neural network in which Morlet wavelet is introduced to the hidden layer.

For the case of optimality with respect to fault tolerance, one common definition is that the post-failure Jacobian possesses the largest possible minimum singular value over all possible locked-joint failures. This work considers a Jacobian that has been designed to be optimally fault tolerant for a simple spatial positioning manipulator. It is shown that despite the fact that the Jacobian is \u201cunique\u201d, up to column permutations and multiplications by \u00b11, there are a large family of physical manipulators that correspond to the optimal Jacobian. Two example manipulators are presented and analyzed. It is shown that there is a large degree of variability in the global kinematic properties of these designs, despite being generated from the same Jacobian.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6083887/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387508","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Examples of spatial positioning redundant robotic manipulators that are optimally fault tolerant","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Examples of spatial positioning redundant robotic manipulators that are optimally fault tolerant","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"2561130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137134S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6083887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6083896,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The importance of RNN can be highlighted by the fact that the information about the underlying dynamics of such systems is not available. The dynamics can only be observed with the help of certain measurable variables. In this context, Recurrent Neural Network based approach is a powerful tool with promising results. In conventional Neural Network based approaches, periodic training is required. The time between retraining is still an open issue.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083896","startPage":"1580","endPage":"1584","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070513/6083622/06083896.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Textile plant modeling using Recurrent Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Yarn","Fabrics","Recurrent neural networks","Mathematical model","Predictive models","Optical fiber networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dyeing","fabrics","recurrent neural nets","textile industry","yarn"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["textile plant modeling","recurrent neural networks","industrial systems","textile process","yarn color","fabric color"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["textile dying","dynamic systems","recurrent neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Textile plant modeling using Recurrent Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6083896/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387517","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Textile plant modeling using Recurrent Neural Networks","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"2651165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050917S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6083896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6083903,"authors":[{"name":"Jhing-Fa Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jhing-Fa","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280532500"},{"name":"Jr-Shiang Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jr-Shiang","lastName":"Peng","id":"37088291040"},{"name":"Jia-Ching Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jia-Ching","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292902200"},{"name":"Po-Chuan Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Tung Fang Deign University, Kaohsiung Country, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Chuan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37335561100"},{"name":"Ta-Wen Kuan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ta-Wen","lastName":"Kuan","id":"37575021000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0653-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0652-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0651-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6083903","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":454},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083903","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Support vector machines","Hardware","Feature extraction","Speech","Speaker recognition","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","embedded systems","hardware-software codesign","optimisation","speaker recognition","support vector machines","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-software codesign","fast-trainable speaker identification system","sequential minimal optimization","embedded system","human-machine interface","training phase","multiclass identification phase","sequential minimal optimization training algorithm","computational load","VLSI module","speech preprocess","speech feature extraction","SVM voting strategy","data-packed mechanism","embedded C code","ARM processor","NIST 2010 speaker recognition database","Socle CDK prototype","a AMBA based Xilinx FPGA","ARM926EJ processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speaker Identification","Hardware/Software Co-design","Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO)"]}],"abstract":"Embedded speaker identification system is a popular research, but most of current systems can not provide fast training ability. Because of the low computational ability in the embedded environment, a large amount of waiting time usually makes the human-machine interface not friendly. This paper presents a hardware and software (HW/SW) co-design solution for fast-trainable speaker identification system. Fast training ability makes this embedded speaker identification system possess high flexibility and enhances the convenience to a wide range of real-world applications. The proposed system consists of a training phase and a multiclass identification phase. The sequential minimal optimization (SMO) training algorithm occupies the heaviest computational load and is realized as a dedicated VLSI module, i.e., the hardware component. The other processes such as speech preprocess, speech feature extraction, and SVM voting strategy are implemented by software. Moreover, a data-packed mechanism is presented to improve the bandwidth utilization. Compared with the embedded C code based on ARM processor, our system reduces 90% of the training time and achieves 89.9% identification rate with the NIST 2010 speaker recognition database. The proposed system was tested and found to be fully functional working on a Socle CDK prototype system with an AMBA based Xilinx FPGA and an ARM926EJ processor.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083903","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070513/6083622/06083903.pdf","startPage":"1621","endPage":"1625","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware/software co-design for fast-trainable speaker identification system based on SMO","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hardware/software co-design for fast-trainable speaker identification system based on SMO","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6083903/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387524","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083903/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware/software co-design for fast-trainable speaker identification system based on SMO","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"2722013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063837S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6083903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":6083905,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Barthold","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Barthold","id":"38228848900"},{"name":"Kalyan Pathapati Subbu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kalyan","lastName":"Pathapati Subbu","id":"37298385300"},{"name":"Ram Dantu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, TX, USA","Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Ram","lastName":"Dantu","id":"37394563100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0653-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0652-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0651-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6083905","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gyroscopes","Magnetic sensors","Acceleration","Accelerometers","Mobile handsets","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gyroscopes","mobile handsets","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gyroscope-embedded mobile phone","pedometer","navigation system","orientation sensor","magnetic interference","Nexus S smartphone","drift error analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile phone","Orientation sensor","Gyroscope","Accelerometer","Angular rotation"]}],"abstract":"Many mobile phone applications such as pedometers and navigation systems rely on orientation sensors that most smartphones are now equipped with. Unfortunately, these sensors rely on measured accelerometer and magnetic field data to determine the orientation. Thus, accelerations upon the phone which arise from everyday use alter orientation information. Similarly, external magnetic interferences from indoor/urban settings affect the heading calculation, resulting in inaccurate directional information. The inability to determine the orientation during everyday use inhibits many potential mobile applications development. In this work, we exploit the newly built-in gyroscope in the Nexus S smartphone to address the interference problems associated with the orientation sensor. We first perform drift error analysis and apply this to gyroscope calculations. We test simple as well as complex rotations seen in walking applications. We lastly test the gyroscope's resistance to described interferences. Experiments show angular calculations with percent error no larger than 6% from actual rotated values. Further, we are able to determine the phone's orientation at any time, in magnetically-interfered areas, with the phone accelerating. With this accurate information we can virtually orient the phone to better use mobile-acquired data. This shows that the presence of a gyroscope in smartphones will certainly aid in numerous applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083905","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070513/6083622/06083905.pdf","startPage":"1632","endPage":"1638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of gyroscope-embedded mobile phones","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083905/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of gyroscope-embedded mobile phones","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387526","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6083905/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of gyroscope-embedded mobile phones","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"2742026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066792S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6083905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6083930,"authors":[{"name":"Nai-Jen Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Nai-Jen","lastName":"Li","id":"37086672740"},{"name":"Wen-June Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-June","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280462200"},{"name":"Chen-Chien Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics Technology, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Chien","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37308458400"},{"name":"Chih-Min Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Min","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278409600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0653-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0652-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0651-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6083930","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":284},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Optimization","Benchmark testing","Conferences","Educational institutions","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global optimization","randomly adapting particle swarm optimization approach","weighed particle","multidimensional optimization problem","explorative search","exploitative search"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Randomly adapting particle swarm optimization","weighed particle","optimization","evolutionary algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083930","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel randomly adapting particle swarm optimization (RAPSO) approach which uses a weighed particle in a swarm to solve multi-dimensional optimization problems.

In this paper, we investigate sensor location estimation problem where a target sensor measures inconsistent signals as received-signal-strength or time-of-arrival from anchor sensors with known locations, whereas target sensor location must be estimated. We know that even in large scale wireless sensor networks, information are relatively sparse compared with the number of sensors. In such networks, the localization problem can be recast as a sparse signal recovery problem in the discrete spatial domain from a small number of linear measurements by solving an under-determined linear system. By exploiting the compressive sensing theory, sparse signals can be recovered from far fewer samples than Nyquist sampling rate.

Under the uncertain environment, the variable structure under-actuated control (VSUC) with the satisfaction of suitable condition is designed to asymptotically track the reference signal. Otherwise, a bounded tracking result is obtained for the mild condition. In this situation, an on-line neural network modeling for the uncertainty is applied to construct a neural-network-based variable structure under-actuated control (NVSUC) to improve the system performance; e.g., the bounded tracking result of previous VSUC becomes an asymptotical tracking. The proposed hybrid neural-network-based variable structure under-actuated control (HNVSUC) combining VSUC and NVSUC with a transition can be employed to a class of under-actuated and uncertain nonlinear systems. Finally, the corresponding simulations of the balance control of a double inverted pendulum on a cart are undertaken to confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083966/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12387586","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6083966/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A class of under-actuated and uncertain nonlinear dynamic systems by hybrid neural-network-based variable structure control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A class of under-actuated and uncertain nonlinear dynamic systems by hybrid neural-network-based variable structure control","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"3361070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05552S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6083966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6083975,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Lyang Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Lyang","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37277260100"},{"name":"Hai-Wu Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hai-Wu","lastName":"Lee","id":"38240270200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0653-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0652-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0651-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6083975","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083975","abstract":"In this paper, the functional commands based on hand gesture are designed by Hu moments and contour sequence moments, which are invariant to the translation, rotation and scale of a hand gesture.

According to recent development in computer science, multi-point global search methods, most of which are classified into evolutionary computation and/or meta-heuristic methods, have been proposed and applied to various types of optimization problems. However, applications of them to min-max problems have been scarce despite their theoretical and practical importance. Since direct application of evolutionary computation methods to min-max problems wouldn't work effectively, a modified PSO algorithm for solving them is proposed. The proposed method is designed: (1) to approximate the minimized and maximized functions of min-max problems by using a finite number of search points; and, (2) to obtain one of \u201cmin-max = max-min\u201d solutions by finding the minimum of the maximized function and the maximum of the minimized function. Numerical examples demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6083984/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387604","htmlLink":"/document/6083984/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel method for solving min-max problems by using a modified particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel method for solving min-max problems by using a modified particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"3543004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096809S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6083984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6083990,"authors":[{"name":"Fagner Andrade de Oliveira","affiliation":["Marcos de Azevedo Reis, Department of Computer Science and Department of Economics, Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica de Minas Gerais-MG, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fagner","lastName":"Andrade de Oliveira","id":"38242289600"},{"name":"Luis Enrique Z\u00e1rate","affiliation":["Marcos de Azevedo Reis, Department of Computer Science and Department of Economics, Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica de Minas Gerais-MG, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Enrique Z\u00e1rate","id":"37297413400"},{"name":"Marcos de Azevedo Reis","affiliation":["Marcos de Azevedo Reis, Department of Computer Science and Department of Economics, Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica de Minas Gerais-MG, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"],"firstName":"Marcos","lastName":"de Azevedo Reis","id":"38228909100"},{"name":"Cristiane Neri Nobre","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei-MG UFSJ, Sao Joao del-Rei, Brazil"],"firstName":"Cristiane","lastName":"Neri Nobre","id":"37592053300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0653-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0652-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0651-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6083990","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1057},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forecasting","Biological neural networks","Time series analysis","Indexes","Macroeconomics","Stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","mean square error methods","neural nets","pricing","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural networks","stock prices","stock prediction","mathematical models","computational algorithms","stock PETR4","window size","prediction horizon","mean squared error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Network","Financial Time Series","Stock","PETR4","Forecasting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6083990","abstract":"In recent years there has been a significant growth of interest in the incorporation of historical series of variables related to stock prediction into mathematical models or computational algorithms in order to generate predictions or indications about expected price movements.

Neural networks have been widely used for traffic speed prediction. However, the classical neural network usually lacks satisfactory generalization ability, which usually results in an imprecise prediction of traffic speed. Regularization is an essential technique to improve the generalization ability of neural network. Regularization is realized by adding a weight decay function to the energy function of the neural network. One of the key problems of the regularization technique is how to decide the parameter of the weight decay function. In this paper, the Bayesian technique is used to optimize these regularization parameters and a Bayesian regularized neural network (BRNN) used for traffic speed prediction is proposed. The speed prediction model was validated by the real-world traffic speeds of the Hangzhou city collected from the floating car system. The experimental results show that the proposed method is able to improve the generalization ability of neural networks, and can achieve better prediction results than several traditional prediction models.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6084006","startPage":"2215","endPage":"2220","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6084006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083622","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070513/6083622/06084006.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bayesian regularized neural network approach to short-term traffic speed prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084006/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian regularized neural network approach to short-term traffic speed prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6084006/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12387626","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian regularized neural network approach to short-term traffic speed prediction","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"3713179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058091S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6084006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6084009,"authors":[{"name":"Awhan Patnaik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India"],"firstName":"Awhan","lastName":"Patnaik","id":"37703107700"},{"name":"L.

In this work we propose a general principle based on using the inverse mapping from objective space to decision space that allows for the creation of diverse solutions in a direct manner. When analytical forms of objective functions are known, we propose a method of generating set-valued inverse maps, in functional or algorithmic form, which when restricted to the feasible search range yield pseudo inverses of objectives. In the absence of analytical functional forms we propose the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in a novel configuration to directly learn the inverse map without network inversion procedures. We implement two diversity creation operators and use them in a standard binary multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) to solve standard bi-objective optimization problems. We also propose a parameter less approach of fixing the number and desirable locations of solutions in sparse regions. Proposed algorithms are compared with NSGA-II and it is shown that the proposed algorithms achieve desired level of diversity in fewer function evaluations compared to NSGA-II.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6084009","startPage":"2232","endPage":"2237","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070513/6083622/06084009.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6084009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity improvement of solutions in multiobjective genetic algorithms using pseudo function inverses","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Artificial neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Optimization","Search problems","Equations","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity improvement","multiobjective genetic algorithm","pseudo function inverse","niching","fitness sharing scheme","inverse mapping","decision space","objective function","set-valued inverse maps","algorithmic form","analytical functional forms","artificial neural networks","diversity creation operator","biobjective optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-objective genetic algorithms","Artificial Neural Networks","inverse problems","optimization","function approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Diversity improvement of solutions in multiobjective genetic algorithms using pseudo function inverses","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6084009/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387629","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity improvement of solutions in multiobjective genetic algorithms using pseudo function inverses","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"3744169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071027S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6084009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6084013,"authors":[{"name":"Rashmi Dutta Baruah","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, InfoLab21, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK"],"firstName":"Rashmi","lastName":"Dutta Baruah","id":"37085373754"},{"name":"Plamen Angelov","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, InfoLab21, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK"],"firstName":"Plamen","lastName":"Angelov","id":"37271542300"},{"name":"Javier Andreu","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, InfoLab21, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Andreu","id":"37889267700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0653-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0652-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0651-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6084013","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6084013","abstract":"This paper presents the sequel of evolving fuzzy rule-based classifier eClass, called here as simplified evolving classifier, simpl_eClass. Similarly to eClass, simpl_eClass comprises of two different classifiers, namely zero and first order (simpl_eClass0 and simpl_eClass1). The two classifiers differ from each other in terms of the consequent part of the fuzzy rules, and the classification strategy used. The design of simpl_eClass is based on the density increment principle introduced recently in so called simpl_eTS+ approach. The rule learning in simpl_eClass does not involve computation of potential values that allows it to attain computationally much less expensive model update phase compared to eClass. As compared to other FRB classifiers, it retains all the advantages of eClass, such as being on-line and evolving, having zero and first order. In comparison with other non-fuzzy classifiers it has the advantage of interpretability and transparency (especially zero order type). The goals of this paper are to demonstrate the applicability of simpl_eTS+ to classification task, and to empirically show that the simplification of eClass to simpl_eClass by using potential-free approach does not compromise the accuracy of the classifiers. In order to attain the goals, the classifiers are tested by performing several experiments using benchmark data sets. The simpl_eClass1 classifier is also applied to the real-life problem of on-line scene categorization for low-resource devices benefiting from its low computational cost. The results obtained from the experiments endorse that simpl_eClass achieves the accuracy of eClass while simplifying rule learning process.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Data models","Firing","Adaptation models","Classification algorithms","Vectors","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","transparency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Simpl_eClass","simplified potential-free evolving fuzzy rule-based classifiers","simplified evolving classifier","zero order","first order","simpl_eClass0","simpl_eClass1","classification strategy","density increment principle","simpl_eTS+ approach","FRB classifiers","nonfuzzy classifiers","interpretability","transparency","potential-free approach","online scene categorization","low-resource devices","computational cost","rule learning process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["evolving fuzzy system","evolving fuzzy rule-based classifier","on-line scene recognition"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6084013","startPage":"2249","endPage":"2254","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070513/6083622/06084013.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6084013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simpl_eClass: Simplified potential-free evolving fuzzy rule-based classifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Simpl_eClass: Simplified potential-free evolving fuzzy rule-based classifiers","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12387633","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6084013/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simpl_eClass: Simplified potential-free evolving fuzzy rule-based classifiers","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"3774141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062808S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6084013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6084016,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Hung Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tatung University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Hung","lastName":"Chang","id":"37577193200"},{"name":"Hung-Ching Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tatung University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Ching","lastName":"Lu","id":"37333530400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0653-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0652-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0651-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6084016","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy neural networks","Uncertainty","Lyapunov methods","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","convergence of numerical methods","fuzzy control","induction motor drives","linear motors","Lyapunov methods","motion control","neurocontrollers","periodic control","self-adjusting systems","stability","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organizing fuzzy neural network","control system design","periodic motion control","linear induction motor drive","SOFNN","adaptive control","Lyapunov stability theorem","convergence analysis","discrete function","time-varying external disturbance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive laws","self organizing fuzzy neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6084016","abstract":"This paper focuses on using the self organization fuzzy neural network controller (SOFNN) to accomplish the periodic motion control of the linear induction motor (LIM) drive.

In this paper, an EMG-driven state space model is developed to estimate continuous joint angular displacement and velocity, demonstrated by elbow flexion/ extension. The model combines the Hill-based muscle model with the forward dynamics of joint movement, in which kinematic variables are expressed as a function of neural activation levels. EMG features including integral of absolute value and waveform length are then extracted, and two quadratic equations which associate the kinematic variables with EMG features are constructed to represent the measurement equation. The proposed model are verified by extensively experiments, where the angular movements of human elbow joint are estimated only using the EMG signals, and the estimations are compared with the IMU measurements to validate the accuracy. As a demonstration, a robotic arm is commanded to follow the human elbow movement estimated by the proposed model, which shows the possibility of EMG-based robotic assisted rehabilitation.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6084104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6084104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083622","startPage":"2891","endPage":"2897","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070513/6083622/06084104.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6084104","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Muscles","Joints","Electromyography","Mathematical model","Elbow","Hidden Markov models","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromyography","medical robotics","patient rehabilitation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EMG-driven state space model","continuous joint movements","electromyography","prosthesis","powered exoskeletons","rehabilitative robots","continuous joint angular displacement","elbow flexion/extension","Hill-based muscle model","kinematic variables","neural activation levels","quadratic equations","measurement equation","IMU measurements","robotic arm","human elbow movement","EMG-based robotic assisted rehabilitation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EMG","hill-based muscle model","joint angular movement","state space model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel EMG-driven state space model for the estimation of continuous joint movements","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387724","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6084104/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084104/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel EMG-driven state space model for the estimation of continuous joint movements","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4812048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074299S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6084104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6084115,"authors":[{"name":"Michael A.

The formalism applies to a large class of bio-inspired team dynamics and uses simple algebraic graph theory representations to distinguish between interagent influence, environmental influence, and operator influence. These representations lead to metrics for interagent cohesiveness and responsiveness to human input. We then select two different classes of team dynamics, physicomimetics which encodes dynamics using artificial physics, and a biomimetic structure which encodes dynamics using a model of fish behavior. We then demonstrate the relevance of the metrics by conducting a series experiments that demonstrate differences between leader and predator styles of human influence, and conclude with a comparison of nearest-neighbor topologies to metric-based topologies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward human interaction with bio-inspired robot teams","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6084115","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070513/6083622/06084115.pdf","startPage":"2859","endPage":"2864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6084115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083622","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6084115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Toward human interaction with bio-inspired robot teams","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6084115/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387735","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward human interaction with bio-inspired robot teams","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4762076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064941S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6084115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6084130,"authors":[{"name":"Song Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Yu","id":"38239785600"},{"name":"Hong Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Yan","id":"37275205400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0653-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0652-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0651-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6084130","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"abstract":"This paper presents a new approach for short gene recognition in DNA sequences.

Normal mode analysis (NMA) is used to detect significant structural deformations of nucleosomal DNA. We have found that periodic dinucleotides are usually located at the peaks or valleys of DNA and protein motions, revealing they dominate the nucleosome dynamics.

If properly chosen, the number of measurements can be much smaller than the number of Nyquist rate samples. However, despite the intense focus on the reconstruction of signals, many signal processing problems do not require a full reconstruction of the signal and little attention has been paid to doing inference in the CS domain. In this paper we show the performance of CS for the problem of signal detection using Gauss-Gauss detection. We investigate how the J-divergence and Fisher Discriminant are affected when used in the CS domain. In particular, we demonstrate how to perform detection given the measurements without ever reconstructing the signals themselves and provide theoretical bounds on the performance. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of CS under Gauss-Gauss detection.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070513/6083622/06084184.pdf","startPage":"3335","endPage":"3340","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6084184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6084184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083622","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6084184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing for Gauss-Gauss detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Covariance matrix","Compressed sensing","Noise measurement","Signal to noise ratio","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","Gauss-Gauss detection","compressed sensing","linear measurement","Nyquist rate sample","signal processing problem","signal detection","J-divergence","Fisher discriminant"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["binary hypothesis testing","compressive sensing","Fisher Discriminant","J-divergence","signal detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing for Gauss-Gauss detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6084184/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387804","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing for Gauss-Gauss detection","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5544021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109507S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070513","isNumber":"6083622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070513","xplore-issue":"6083622","articleId":"6084184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6084200,"authors":[{"name":"Nuri Yilmazer","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Texas A and M University, Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Nuri","lastName":"Yilmazer","id":"37317421100"},{"name":"Teniola Elufiede","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Texas A and M University, Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Teniola","lastName":"Elufiede","id":"38229053900"},{"name":"Muhittin Yilmaz","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Texas A and M University, Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Muhittin","lastName":"Yilmaz","id":"37391464400"},{"name":"Mayank Dobriyal","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Texas A and M University, Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mayank","lastName":"Dobriyal","id":"38229053600"},{"name":"Radu F.

The oscillator has a fine-tuning range of \u00b144 ppm, approximately 14 bits of resolution, and an average step size of 0.005 ppm. All signals connecting externally to I/O pins are sine waves for reducing noise, interference, and spurs couplings. The 26 MHz DCXO fabricated in 65 nm CMOS achieves a phase noise of -149.1 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset measured at the sine wave buffer output.

The design employs a self-biased differential amplifier with a dynamic current source to provide gain and linearity. The overall VGA gain is then controlled by a highly linear variable attenuator connected at the output of the amplifier. This separated controlling stage allows the VGA to have a continuous and linear-in-decibel gain curve without sacrificing the bandwidth and linearity of its amplifier stage. A VGA designed with such topology has been fabricated in a standard 0.18- \u03bcm CMOS technology. Targeted for wideband code-division multiple-access applications, the VGA has a maximum gain tuning range from -13.5 to 13.5 dB, a bandwidth better than 1.8 GHz (380 MHz to 2.2 GHz), and a worst case input \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1dB</sub>\n better than -5 and -3.6 dBm, respectively, at 850 MHz and 1.95 GHz.

MPs are in general built using features containing most of the information content of the data, such as the components derived from principal component analysis (PCA). Recently, nonlinear PCA (NLPCA), performed by autoassociative neural network, has emerged as a good unsupervised technique to fit the information content of hyperspectral data into few components. The aim of this letter is to investigate the classification accuracies obtained using extended MPs built from the features of NPCA. A comparison of the two approaches has been validated on two different data sets having different spatial and spectral resolutions/coverages, over the same ground truth, and also using two different classification algorithms. The results show that NLPCA permits one to obtain better classification accuracies than using linear PCA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084704/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","volume":"9","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12575033","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6084704/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Linear Versus Nonlinear PCA for the Classification of Hyperspectral Data Based on the Extended Morphological Profiles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Versus Nonlinear PCA for the Classification of Hyperspectral Data Based on the Extended Morphological Profiles","sourcePdf":"lgrs-licciardi-2172185-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054394S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6163264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"6163264","articleId":"6084704","onlineDate":"18 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6084705,"authors":[{"name":"Krishna Jagannathan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, Chennai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6268389/6084705/6084705-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Krishna Jagannathan received the B.

These disturbances degrade tracking performance significantly and, therefore, should be compensated. To this end, the kinematics with state-dependent disturbances are rigorously derived based on the general form of slippage in the mobile robots, and fuzzy adaptive observers together with parameter adaptation laws are designed to estimate the state-dependent disturbances in both kinematics and dynamics. Because of the modular structure of the proposed method, it can be easily combined with the previous controllers based on the model with the pure nonholonomic constraint, such that the combination of the fuzzy adaptive observers with the previously proposed backstepping-like feedback linearization controller can guarantee the trajectory tracking errors to be globally ultimately bounded, even when the nonholonomic constraint is violated, and their ultimate bounds can be adjusted appropriately for various types of trajectories in the presence of large initial tracking errors and disturbances.

High-resolution spectral estimators, able to accurately discriminate multiple scattering centers in the vertical direction, are used to separate the response of objects and vehicles embedded in a volumetric background. A new polarimetric spectral analysis technique is introduced and is shown to improve the estimation accuracy of the vertical position of both artificial scatterers and natural environments. This approach provides optimal polarimetric features that may be used to further characterize the objects under analysis. The effectiveness of this novel technique for POLTOMSAR is demonstrated using fully polarimetric L-band airborne data sets acquired by the German Aerospace Center (DLR)'s E-SAR system over the test site in Dornstetten, Germany.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2171494","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6200913/06084739.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6200913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2171494","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"2213","endPage":"2225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Under-Foliage Object Imaging Using SAR Tomography and Polarimetric Spectral Estimators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6084739","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Under-Foliage Object Imaging Using SAR Tomography and Polarimetric Spectral Estimators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084739/","volume":"50","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6084739/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12728345","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Under-Foliage Object Imaging Using SAR Tomography and Polarimetric Spectral Estimators","sourcePdf":"tgrs-huang-2171494-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078282S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6200913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"6200913","articleId":"6084739","onlineDate":"18 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6084743,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Najafi","affiliation":["Department of Energy Conversion, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6220909/6084743/6084743-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ehsan Najafi (M'10) was born in Iran in 1979.

Their performance is highly superior to that of conventional two-level inverters due to reduced harmonic distortion, lower electromagnetic interference, and higher dc link voltages. However, it has some disadvantages such as increased number of components, complex pulsewidth modulation control method, and voltage-balancing problem. In this paper, a new topology with a reversing-voltage component is proposed to improve the multilevel performance by compensating the disadvantages mentioned. This topology requires fewer components compared to existing inverters (particularly in higher levels) and requires fewer carrier signals and gate drives. Therefore, the overall cost and complexity are greatly reduced particularly for higher output voltage levels. Finally, a prototype of the seven-level proposed topology is built and tested to show the performance of the inverter by experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2176691","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6220909/06084743.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6220909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2176691","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"4148","endPage":"4154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of a New Multilevel Inverter Topology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6084743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of a New Multilevel Inverter Topology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084743/","volume":"59","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6084743/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"12804835","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of a New Multilevel Inverter Topology","sourcePdf":"tie-najafi-2176691-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062142S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6220909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"255","xplore-issue":"6220909","articleId":"6084743","onlineDate":"18 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":6084746,"authors":[{"name":"Roope Vehkalahti","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Roope","lastName":"Vehkalahti","id":"37540588400"},{"name":"Camilla Hollanti","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and System Analysis, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland","Department of Mathematics, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Camilla","lastName":"Hollanti","id":"37284021000"},{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Oggier","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, Division of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique","lastName":"Oggier","id":"37283997600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"6084746","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":546},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"Multiple-input double-output (MIDO) codes are important in the near-future wireless communications, where the portable end-user device is physically small and will typically contain at most two receive antennas. Especially tempting is the 4\u00d72 channel due to its immediate applicability in the digital video broadcasting (DVB). Such channels optimally employ rate-two space-time (ST) codes consisting of (4\u00d74) matrices. Unfortunately, such codes are in general very complex to decode, hence setting forth a call for constructions with reduced complexity. Recently, some reduced complexity constructions have been proposed, but they have mainly been based on different ad hoc methods and have resulted in isolated examples rather than in a more general class of codes. In this paper, it will be shown that a family of division algebra based MIDO codes will always result in at least 37.5% worst-case complexity reduction, while maintaining full diversity and, for the first time, the nonvanishing determinant (NVD) property. The reduction follows from the fact that, similarly to the Alamouti code, the codes will be subsets of matrix rings of the Hamiltonian quaternions, hence allowing simplified decoding. At the moment, such reductions are among the best known for rate-two MIDO codes [5], [6]. Several explicit constructions are presented and shown to have excellent performance through computer simulations.simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6169172/06084746.pdf","startPage":"2362","endPage":"2385","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2176310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2176310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6169172","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6084746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast-Decodable Asymmetric Space-Time Codes From Division Algebras","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Algebra","Digital video broadcasting","Space-time codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","channel coding","decoding","digital video broadcasting","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast-decodable asymmetric space-time code","division algebra","rate-two multiple-input double-output code","near-future wireless communication","portable end-user device","receive antenna","digital video broadcasting","DVB","ST code","complexity construction","ad hoc method","nonvanishing determinant property","NVD property","Alamouti code","matrix ring subset","Hamiltonian quaternion","rate-two MIDO code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coding gain","cyclic division algebra","digital video broadcasting next generation handheld (DVB-NGH)","fast maximum-likelihood (ML) sphere decoding","Hamiltonian quaternions","Hasse invariants","lattices","low-complexity space-time block codes (STBCs)","multiple-input single/double/multiple-output (MISO/MIDO/MIMO)","nonvanishing determinant (NVD)","orders"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Fast-Decodable Asymmetric Space-Time Codes From Division Algebras","volume":"58","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12592375","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast-Decodable Asymmetric Space-Time Codes From Division Algebras","sourcePdf":"tit-hollanti-2176310-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056419S","chronDate":"April  2012","isNumber":"6169172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"36","articleId":"6084746","onlineDate":"18 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6084747,"authors":[{"name":"Irina E.

The advantages of our methods are threefold. First, they can directly verify system properties based on measured data without knowing system parameters. Second, our calculation precision is higher than traditional approaches, which need to identify the unknown parameters. Third, our methods have lower computational complexities when constructing the controllability and observability matrices.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/6099846/06084754.pdf","startPage":"2388","endPage":"2392","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2011.2170219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2011.2170219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6099846","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6084754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Based Controllability and Observability Analysis of Linear Discrete-Time Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Controllability","Observability","Discrete time systems","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["controllability","discrete time systems","linear systems","matrix algebra","observability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-based controllability","observability analysis","linear discrete-time systems","controllability matrix","observability matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Controllability","data-based analysis","linear discrete-time systems","measured data","observability","unknown parameters"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artificial Intelligence","Data Mining","Databases, Factual","Feedback","Linear Models","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Data-Based Controllability and Observability Analysis of Linear Discrete-Time Systems","volume":"22","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6084754/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12409267","pubMedId":"22113775","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Based Controllability and Observability Analysis of Linear Discrete-Time Systems","sourcePdf":"tnn-wang-pt2-2170219-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063759S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"6099846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6099846","articleId":"6084754","onlineDate":"18 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6084756,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Zhao","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Power Electronics, College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6170969/6084756/6084756-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Zhao (S\u201910) was born in Liaoning, China, in 1983.

The secondary winding of the coupled inductor is inserted into the half-wave voltage doubler cell to extend the voltage gain dramatically and decrease the switch voltage stress effectively. By combining the coupled inductor and voltage doubler cell structure, the disadvantage of the potential resonance between the leakage inductance and the diode stray capacitor is cancelled, and the unexpected high pulsed current in the voltage doubler cell is decreased due to the inherent leakage inductance of the coupled inductor. Meanwhile, the active clamp scheme is employed to recycle the leakage energy, suppress the switch turn-off voltage spikes, and implement zero-voltage-switching turn-on operation. In addition, there is only one magnetic component in the proposed converter and the coupled inductor operates not only as a filter inductor, but also as a transformer when the main switch is in the ON state, which reduces the volume of the magnetic core and improves the power density of the converter. A 500 W prototype operating at 100 kHz with 48 V input and 380 V output is built to verify the analysis. The maximum efficiency of the prototype is nearly 97% and the efficiency is higher than 96% over a wide load range.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2176752","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6170969/06084756.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2176752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170969","startPage":"2869","endPage":"2878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Phase Improved Active Clamp Coupled-Inductor-Based Converter With Extended Voltage Doubler Cell","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6084756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single-Phase Improved Active Clamp Coupled-Inductor-Based Converter With Extended Voltage Doubler Cell","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084756/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12615308","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6084756/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Phase Improved Active Clamp Coupled-Inductor-Based Converter With Extended Voltage Doubler Cell","sourcePdf":"tpel-li-2176752-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109435S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6170969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"6170969","articleId":"6084756","onlineDate":"18 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6084757,"authors":[{"name":"Zixin Li","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6170969/6084757/6084757-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zixin Li (S\u201908\u2013M\u201910) was born in Hebei Province, China, in 1981.

This inverter can output five-level voltage with only one dc source. No split of the dc voltage capacitor is needed, totally avoiding the voltage balancing problem in conventional multilevel inverters. The level of the output voltage is only half of the dc-link voltage in all conditions, leading to much reduced dv/dt . This inverter is based on the widely used three-arm power module and the voltage stresses on all the power switches are the same, making it very easy to construct. Operation mechanism of this inverter is analyzed and the possible switching patterns are investigated. Based on these analyses, a novel optimized modulation scheme is presented. With this modulation method, no dc components exist in the inductor currents, which is very helpful for minimization of the inductors. Simulation and experimental results show the validity of the proposed inverter together with the optimized modulation scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2176753","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6170969/06084757.pdf","startPage":"2716","endPage":"2725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2176753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170969","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6084757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Single-Phase Five-Level Inverter With Coupled Inductors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Single-Phase Five-Level Inverter With Coupled Inductors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084757/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6084757/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12615309","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Single-Phase Five-Level Inverter With Coupled Inductors","sourcePdf":"tpel-li-2176753-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086991S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6170969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6170969","articleId":"6084757","onlineDate":"18 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":6084759,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Xing","affiliation":["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Xing","id":"37400654900"},{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Sun","id":"37281412000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"6084759","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3146},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic interference","Impedance","Inverters","Capacitors","Filtering","Induction motors","Passive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","electromagnetic interference","equivalent circuits","impedance matching","inductors","interference suppression","invertors","passive networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conducted common-mode EMI reduction","impedance balancing","common-mode electromagnetic interference emission reduction","variable-speed motor drives","passive filtering techniques","active filtering techniques","active noise cancellation","passive circuit","inverter CM current","star-connected three-phase RC circuit","CM voltage","inductor","DC bus capacitor","CM current","Wheatstone bridge","CM equivalent circuit","near-ideal cancellation","EMI filtering methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Common-mode EMI","EMI modeling","EMI reduction","impedance balancing"]}],"abstract":"A new method to reduce common-mode (CM) electromagnetic interference (EMI) emission at the dc input of variable-speed motor drives is presented. Unlike conventional passive or active filtering techniques that rely on impedance mismatch or active noise cancellation, the proposed method uses a passive circuit with matched impedance to cancel the inverter CM current. In the proposed approach, a star-connected three-phase RC circuit is placed at the output of the inverter to extract the CM voltage. An inductor is connected between the star point of the RC circuit and the middle of the dc bus capacitor to inject a CM current into the dc input. A Wheatstone bridge is then identified in the CM equivalent circuit of the system with these additional components. By properly selecting the inductor, the Wheatstone bridge can be balanced, resulting in near-ideal cancellation of the input CM current. Development of the method is presented and an experimental setup is used to demonstrate its effects. A comparison with conventional EMI filtering methods in terms of overall filter volume is also presented.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2176750","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6144184/06084759.pdf","startPage":"1084","endPage":"1089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2176750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conducted Common-Mode EMI Reduction by Impedance Balancing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6084759","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084759/","displayDocTitle":"Conducted Common-Mode EMI Reduction by Impedance Balancing","volume":"27","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12524225","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6084759/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conducted Common-Mode EMI Reduction by Impedance Balancing","sourcePdf":"tpel-sun-2176750-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064684S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6144184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6144184","articleId":"6084759","onlineDate":"18 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6084763,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Maria Zanchettin","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea Maria","lastName":"Zanchettin","id":"37546427600"},{"name":"Paolo Rocco","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Rocco","id":"37274178600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1552-3098"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0468"}],"articleNumber":"6084763","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":822},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6084763","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Redundancy","Kinematics","Manipulators","Jacobian matrices","Joints","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","end effectors","industrial manipulators","manipulator kinematics","redundant manipulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user-oriented framework","task augmentation","redundant robotic manipulator","kinematic control","end effector","holonomic redundancy resolution technique","closed-loop inverse kinematics algorithm","user-defined redundancy resolution criterion","industrial robot","7-degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic manipulator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Kinematics","path planning for manipulators","programming environment","redundant robots"]}],"abstract":"Redundant robotic manipulators under kinematic control may exhibit unpredictable behaviors at the joint level. When the end effector describes a closed trajectory, the joint angles may not return to their initial values. Likewise, final configuration in the joint space may depend on the trajectory that is followed by the end effector. In this paper, a complete parameterization of holonomic redundancy resolution techniques that avoid these problems is proposed. The flexibility of the proposed approach is discussed. In particular, it is shown that the selection of the redundancy resolution criterion is totally decoupled from the implementation of a closed-loop inverse kinematics (CLIK) algorithm. Any user-defined redundancy resolution criterion can, thus, be enforced. Potentialities of this new methodology are experimentally verified on an industrial robot in a case study where functional redundancy occurs and is applied in simulation on a 7-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) anthropomorphic manipulator.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2011.2173852","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/6177749/06084763.pdf","startPage":"514","endPage":"521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2011.2173852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6177749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General User-Oriented Framework for Holonomic Redundancy Resolution in Robotic Manipulators Using Task Augmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084763/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"A General User-Oriented Framework for Holonomic Redundancy Resolution in Robotic Manipulators Using Task Augmentation","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6084763/","accessionNumber":"12638964","volume":"28","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General User-Oriented Framework for Holonomic Redundancy Resolution in Robotic Manipulators Using Task Augmentation","sourcePdf":"tro-zanchettin-2173852-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060948S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6177749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6177749","articleId":"6084763","onlineDate":"18 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6084767,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Unidirectional V2G is a logical first step because it can be implemented on standard J1772 chargers and it does not degrade EV batteries from cycling. In this work an optimal combined bidding formulation for regulation and spinning reserves is developed to be used by aggregators. This formulation takes into account unplanned departures by EV owners during contract periods and compensates accordingly. Optional load level and price constraints are also developed. These algorithms maximize profits to the aggregator while increasing the benefits the customers and utility. Simulations over a three month period on the ERCOT system show that implementation of these algorithms can provide significant benefits to customers, utilities, and aggregators. Comparisons with bidirectional V2G show that while the benefits of unidirectional V2G are significantly lower, so are the risks.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2011.2170099","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6155182/06084772.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2011.2170099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155182","startPage":"70","endPage":"79","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Combined Bidding of Vehicle-to-Grid Ancillary Services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6084772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Combined Bidding of Vehicle-to-Grid Ancillary Services","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084772/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12543449","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6084772/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Combined Bidding of Vehicle-to-Grid Ancillary Services","sourcePdf":"tsg-sortomme-2170099-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092067S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6155182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"6155182","articleId":"6084772","onlineDate":"18 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6084802,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyi Yong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6134620/6084802/6084802-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinyi Yong received the B.A.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in biomedical engineering from the University of Malaya, Malaysia, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.

To make a text-entry of a letter/word, the user must gaze at the target for at least a specific period of time (called the dwell time) and then activate the self-paced BCI with an attempted hand extension. Although the self-paced BCI is available for use at any time, a built-in sleep mode is activated when the user is not looking at a letter/word or when the user gazes at a letter/word for less than the dwell time. Such a design has the advantage of greatly minimizing the false positive outcomes compared to the state-of-art self-paced BCIs. To further improve the system's performance, a method that adaptively updates the BCI classifier is also proposed. The results from seven able-bodied individuals show great improvements compared to the pure self-paced BCI.

It is shown that the 2-D Roesser system framework can be established for general ILC systems regardless of relative degree, under which convergence conditions can be provided to guarantee both asymptotic stability and monotonic convergence of the ILC processes. In particular, conditions for the monotonic convergence of ILC can be given in terms of linear matrix inequalities, and formulas for the updating law can be derived simultaneously.

These results are also compared to heavy-ion results taken on the same devices. Sandia SRAM data taken on different test dates resulted in considerably different TPA laser pulse energy thresholds even though the TPA system was calibrated using standard techniques each test date. These differences are believed to be due to changes in laser spot size. This shows that it is imperative to develop a calibration procedure that monitors all relevant laser parameters if TPA is to be used as a routine quantitative tool. Removing the back substrate makes a very large difference in TPA laser pulse energy threshold. This large difference is likely due to either displacement currents generated in the back substrate by TPA and/or nonlinear optical effects which can reduce the laser pulse irradiance in the active region. Nevertheless, the mechanism does not appear to affect the qualitative nature of TPA measurements. Both SPA and TPA laser measurements were used to estimate the heavy-ion threshold LETs of the Sandia DPSRAMs and 45-nm IBM SRAMs. Both SPA and TPA overestimated the heavy-ion threshold LET of the IBM 45-nm SRAMs (likely due to the large laser spot size compared to the size of the SRAM cell), but reasonably estimated the threshold LETs of the Sandia DPSRAMs. For the first time, TPA laser pulse energy (squared) is directly compared to SPA laser pulse energy at threshold. There is reasonable quantitative agreement between the charge required to induce upsets by TPA and SPA with the back substrate removed.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2011.2171006","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/6093861/06084847.pdf","startPage":"2968","endPage":"2975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6093861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2011.2171006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Single and Two-Photon Absorption for Laser Characterization of Single-Event Upsets in SOI SRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084847/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Single and Two-Photon Absorption for Laser Characterization of Single-Event Upsets in SOI SRAMs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6084847/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408910","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Single and Two-Photon Absorption for Laser Characterization of Single-Event Upsets in SOI SRAMs","sourcePdf":"tns-schwank-2171006-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086507S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"6093861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6093861","articleId":"6084847","onlineDate":"18 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6084852,"authors":[{"name":"Robert A.

It removes involuntary motion, such as tremor, by the actuation of the tip to counteract the effect of the undesired handle motion. The key components are a 3-degree-of-freedom (DOF) piezoelectric manipulator that has a 400-\u03bcm range of motion, 1-N force capability, and bandwidth over 100 Hz, and an optical position-measurement subsystem that acquires the tool pose with 4-\u03bcm resolution at 2000 samples/s. A control system using these components attenuates hand motion by at least 15 dB (a fivefold reduction). By the consideration of the effect of the frequency response of Micron on the human visual feedback loop, we have developed a filter that reduces unintentional motion, yet preserves the intuitive eye-hand coordination. We evaluated the effectiveness of Micron by measuring the accuracy of the human/machine system in three simple manipulation tasks. Handheld testing by three eye surgeons and three nonsurgeons showed a reduction in the position error of between 32% and 52%, depending on the error metric.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12524342","htmlLink":"/document/6084852/","pubMedId":"23028266","displayDocTitle":"Micron: An Actively Stabilized Handheld Tool for Microsurgery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Micron: An Actively Stabilized Handheld Tool for Microsurgery","sourcePdf":"tro-maclachlan-2169634-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104427S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6145195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"6145195","articleId":"6084852","onlineDate":"18 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6084856,"authors":[{"name":"Haibin Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, Nipissing University, North Bay, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/6182955/6084856/6084856-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haibin Zhu (M'02\u2013SM'04) received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from the Institute of Engineering and Technology, Zhengzhou, China, in 1983 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), Changsha, China, in 1988 and 1997, respectively.","He is a Full Professor with the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, Nipissing University, North Bay, ON, Canada.

As already described in past literature, direct data domain STAP (also known as deterministic STAP) has several advantages compared to traditional stochastic STAP. In particular, being implicitly a single snapshot interference cancellation technique, deterministic STAP generally outperforms stochastic STAP in fast varying interference scenarios. On the other hand, in its classical derivation, target detection performances of deterministic STAP are severely deteriorated in case of uncertainty in the knowledge of exact target parameters as direction of arrival (DOA) and Doppler frequency. To overcome this problem, we propose a robust implementation of deterministic STAP in order to take into account a possible mismatch between the nominal and the actual target parameters. The proposed approach reformulates the deterministic STAP problem in the context of convex problem optimization. A detailed analysis of the maximum acceptable target parameters error is conducted, which ensures the existence of a numerical solution for the convex problem optimization. The proposed robust deterministic approach is defined for both the one dimensional (spatial-only) and the two dimensional (space-time) case. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown both in simulated scenarios and by direct application to real data taken from the experimental multichannel radar system PAMIR developed at Fraunhofer FHR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12527106","htmlLink":"/document/6084857/","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Direct Data Domain Approach for STAP","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Direct Data Domain Approach for STAP","sourcePdf":"tsp-cristallini-2176335-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077743S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6146821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6146821","articleId":"6084857","onlineDate":"18 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6084858,"authors":[{"name":"Shoushun Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6257480/6084858/6084858-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shoushun Chen (S'04\u2013M'07) received the B.S. degree from Peking University, Peking, China, and the M.E. degree from Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2000, 2003, and 2007, respectively.","He held a post-doctoral research fellowship with the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, for one year after graduation.

Firstly, a model of parallel hybrid electric vehicle for optimal simulation is established. Secondly, based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms II, a methodological approach for the simultaneous optimization of HEV parameters to minimize the fuel consumption and emissions was proposed, which adopts ADVISOR to simulate.

Finally, the band-to-band tunneling used to program the 1-state strongly reduces the power consumption and improves the device reliability. These promising results promote the meta-stable dip (MSD) programming mechanism as a viable solution for low power single-transistor DRAM memories.","publicationTitle":"2011 - 14th International Symposium on Electrets","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 - 14th International Symposium on Electrets","pdfPath":"/iel5/6070516/6084951/06084998.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"94","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1T-DRAM at the 22nm technology node and beyond: An alternative to DRAM with high-k storage capacitor","doi":"10.1109/ISE.2011.6084998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6084951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISE.2011.6084998","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6084998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6084998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"1T-DRAM at the 22nm technology node and beyond: An alternative to DRAM with high-k storage capacitor","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387885","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6084998/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1T-DRAM at the 22nm technology node and beyond: An alternative to DRAM with high-k storage capacitor","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100991S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6070516","isNumber":"6084951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6070516","xplore-issue":"6084951","articleId":"6084998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6085069,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Hung Du","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, Microelectronics and Information System Research Center (MIRC), National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Hung","lastName":"Du","id":"38236719900"},{"name":"Ming-Hung Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, Microelectronics and Information System Research Center (MIRC), National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Hung","lastName":"Chang","id":"37536194400"},{"name":"Hao-Yi Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, Microelectronics and Information System Research Center (MIRC), National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hao-Yi","lastName":"Yang","id":"38239004700"},{"name":"Wei Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, Microelectronics and Information System Research Center (MIRC), National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37285310100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1617-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1616-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1615-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-1676"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2164-1676"}],"articleNumber":"6085069","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":479},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An energy-efficient 10T SRAM-based FIFO memory operating in near-/sub-threshold regions","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6076821/6085068/06085069.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"23","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International SOC Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2011.6085069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085068","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2011.6085069","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","CMOS technology","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body area networks","low-power electronics","power control","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient 10T SRAM-based FIFO memory","ultra-low power 16Kb SRAM-based first-in first-out memory","wireless body area networks","high variation immunity","data-dependent bit-line leakage","adaptive power control circuit","counter-based pointers","smart replica read/write control unit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6085069","abstract":"In this paper, an ultra-low power (ULP) 16Kb SRAM-based first-in first-out (FIFO) memory is proposed for wireless body area networks (WBANs).

Regression suite is maintained in the entire verification phase with an increase of the scale. However, the executing cost is always high when running the entire suite on a RTL-level simulator. Regression suite reduction (called RSR for short) is presented to reduce the executing cost of the regression suite without debasing the quality of the functional verification. For this two-objective RSR of microprocessors, we present a heuristic algorithm which mainly combines cluster analysis with genetic algorithm (called CGA for short). The experiments on some regression suites at different scales for a microprocessor have shown the efficiency and feasibility of CGA.

However, due to process variations and device mismatch at nanoscale technology nodes, voltage scaling of standard SRAMs is limited to strong-inversion operation. One of the techniques for enabling operation at low voltages is implementation of a Supply Feedback mechanism that internally weakens the pull-up current during write operations. This concept was recently implemented in a 9T Supply Feedback SRAM (SF-SRAM) cell, fabricated and successfully tested in a 40nm CMOS technology. In this paper, we review existing low voltage SRAM solutions, overview the SF-SRAM cell, and show its scalability into deep nanoscale technologies by using the 22nm predictive model.","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2011.6085135","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International SOC Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6076821/6085068/06085135.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2011.6085135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low voltage SRAMs and the scalability of the 9T Supply Feedback SRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Low voltage SRAMs and the scalability of the 9T Supply Feedback SRAM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388088","htmlLink":"/document/6085135/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low voltage SRAMs and the scalability of the 9T Supply Feedback SRAM","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"P18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059524S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6076821","isNumber":"6085068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6076821","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6085068","articleId":"6085135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6085136,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Cui","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Cui","id":"38061377600"},{"name":"Xiao Peng","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Peng","id":"37310543000"},{"name":"Zhixiang Chen","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Zhixiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37536706200"},{"name":"Xiongxin Zhao","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Xiongxin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37539425200"},{"name":"Yichao Lu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Yichao","lastName":"Lu","id":"38240436900"},{"name":"Dajiang Zhou","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Dajiang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37403106700"},{"name":"Satoshi Goto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Goto","id":"37279993400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1617-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1616-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1615-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-1676"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2164-1676"}],"articleNumber":"6085136","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Parallel processing","Clocks","Parity check codes","Logic gates","Hardware","Parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","message passing","parity check codes","turbo codes","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel decoder architecture","quasi-cyclic codes","low density parity check codes","WiMAX","turbo decoding message passing","TDMP algorithm","QC LDPC decoder"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel high parallel decoder architecture for the quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes defined in WiMAX system.

The \u201cdigital\u201d biochips are manipulating liquids not as a continuous flow, but as discrete droplets on a two-dimensional array of electrodes. Basic microfluidic operations, such as mixing and dilution, are performed on the array, by routing the corresponding droplets on a series of electrodes. The challenges facing biochips are similar to those faced by microelectronics some decades ago. Computer-Aided Design tools for microfluidics are in their infancy, and designers are currently using manual, bottom-up design approaches to implement such biochips. Considering their architecture and the design tasks that have to be performed, the design of digital biochips has similarities to the high-level synthesis of integrated circuits. Motivated by this similarity, a few researchers have recently started to propose approaches for the top-down design of biochips. So far, they have assumed that operations are executing on virtual modules of rectangular shape, formed by grouping adjacent electrodes, and which have a fixed placement on the array. However, operations can actually execute by routing the droplets on any sequence of electrodes on the biochip. In this paper, we outline the original module-based synthesis problem, and then we present recent work which eliminates the concept of virtual modules and allows droplets to move on the chip on any route during operation execution. We discuss the advantages of such an approach, and identify the challenges and opportunities of system-level design of digital microfluidic biochips.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent research and emerging challenges in the System-Level Design of digital microfluidic biochips","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International SOC Conference","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2011.6085142","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6076821/6085068/06085142.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2011.6085142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085068","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6085142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Recent research and emerging challenges in the System-Level Design of digital microfluidic biochips","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6085142/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388095","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent research and emerging challenges in the System-Level Design of digital microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"S12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13128S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6076821","isNumber":"6085068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6076821","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6085068","articleId":"6085142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6085143,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Wei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Wei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37401324800"},{"name":"Yan-You Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Yan-You","lastName":"Lin","id":"38239716200"},{"name":"Jia-Wen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jia-Wen","lastName":"Chang","id":"38541730700"},{"name":"Tsung-Yi Ho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Yi","lastName":"Ho","id":"37398757000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1617-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1616-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1615-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-1676"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2164-1676"}],"articleNumber":"6085143","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"abstract":"Advances in droplet-based digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) have led to the emergence of biochips for automating laboratory procedures in biochemistry and molecular biology.

To meet the challenges of increasing design complexity, computer-aided-design (CAD) tools have been involved to build DMFBs efficiently. This paper provides an overview of DMFBs and describes emerging CAD tools for the automated synthesis and optimization of DMFB designs, from fluidic-level synthesis to chip-level design. Design automations are expected to relieve the design burden of manual optimization of bioassays, time-consuming chip designs, and costly testing and maintenance procedures. With the assistance of CAD tools, users can concentrate on the development and abstraction of nanoscale bioassays while leaving chip optimization and implementation details to CAD tools.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6076821/6085068/06085143.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"17","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International SOC Conference","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2011.6085143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2011.6085143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085068","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6085143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent research and emerging challenges in design and optimization for digital microfluidic biochips","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wires","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","bioMEMS","CAD","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","molecular biophysics","nanoelectronics","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization","droplet-based digital microfluidic biochips","laboratory procedure automation","molecular biology","biochemical reagents","bioassay operations","electronics","sample preparation","computer-aided-design tools","design complexity","automated synthesis","nanoscale bioassays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Recent research and emerging challenges in design and optimization for digital microfluidic biochips","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6085143/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388096","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent research and emerging challenges in design and optimization for digital microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"S13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084986S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6076821","isNumber":"6085068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6076821","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6085068","articleId":"6085143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6085145,"authors":[{"name":"Ruolin Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, USA"],"firstName":"Ruolin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37395119200"},{"name":"Xue Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, USA"],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Li","id":"37406896700"},{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Texas Woman's University, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38241516200"},{"name":"Zhiqiang Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37291502200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1617-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1616-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1615-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-1676"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2164-1676"}],"articleNumber":"6085145","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":865},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chaotic communication","Frequency domain analysis","Sensors","TV","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic communication","cognitive radio","signal generators","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software defined radio","frequency domain chaotic cognitive radio","chaotic communication","multipath fading","spectrum congestion","time-domain chaotic signal generator","chaotic sequence","spectrum mask","frequency domain non-contiguous chaotic waveform","GNU radio software","realtime video transmission","dynamic cognitive radio waveform"]}],"abstract":"Chaotic communication system has attracted strong interests in high security communication due to robustness in multi-path fading environments, resistance to jamming, and low probability of interception. Recently, cognitive radio has emerged as a strong candidate to solve the spectrum congestion problem by operating over under utilized spectrum bands. Hence, it is highly desired to combine the security advantages of chaos communication with cognitive radio to create a chaotic cognitive radio communication system. However, traditional chaotic communication system is based on time-domain chaotic signal generator where the signal occupies one wide contiguous frequency band, making it inappropriate for cognitive radio applications. To apply the chaotic sequence onto cognitive radio to take advantage of multiple spectrum bands, we generate the chaotic signal in frequency domain. By applying a spectrum mask onto the chaotic signal in frequency-domain, a frequency domain non-contiguous chaotic waveform is created. In this paper, we use universal software radio peripheral and GNU radio software to implement and demonstrate a frequency domain chaotic cognitive radio. This demonstration has several unique features: (1) supporting real-time video transmission; (2) taking advantage of multiple non-contiguous spectrum bands; (3) dynamic cognitive radio waveform adaptation according to the primary user transmissions; (4) maintaining the security features of chaotic communication.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software defined radio based frequency domain chaotic cognitive radio","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International SOC Conference","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2011.6085145","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6076821/6085068/06085145.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2011.6085145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085068","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6085145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Software defined radio based frequency domain chaotic cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6085145/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388098","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software defined radio based frequency domain chaotic cognitive radio","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"S22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061907S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6076821","isNumber":"6085068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6076821","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6085068","articleId":"6085145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6085167,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Buso","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering-DEI, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Buso","id":"37274330600"},{"name":"Giorgio Spiazzi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering-DEI, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Spiazzi","id":"37275791100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1646-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1644-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1645-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0454"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2175-8603"}],"articleNumber":"6085167","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":513},"abstract":"The paper illustrates the design of a white light solid state lamp, presenting a controlled quality of the emitted luminous flux in terms of both luminance and color temperature.

While presenting similar complexity and overall efficiency with respect to a conventional driver, the proposed circuit allows a significant volume reduction and consequent power density improvement.","doi":"10.1109/COBEP.2011.6085168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COBEP.2011.6085168","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"XI Brazilian Power Electronics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069887/6085159/06085168.pdf","publicationTitle":"XI Brazilian Power Electronics Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Line fed solid state lamp driver based on the asymmetrical half bridge flyback converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Line fed solid state lamp driver based on the asymmetrical half bridge flyback converter","conferenceDate":"11-15 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6085168/","accessionNumber":"12387168","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085168/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Line fed solid state lamp driver based on the asymmetrical half bridge flyback converter","confLoc":"Natal, Brazil","sourcePdf":"iREP1239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046242S","chronDate":"11-15 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069887","isNumber":"6085159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069887","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6085159","articleId":"6085168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6085172,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo Andreoli de Marchi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Campinas-UNICAMP, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rodrigo Andreoli","lastName":"de Marchi","id":"38230361100"},{"name":"Fernando J.

The investigated results in this paper show that the statistical properties of the synthesized data are well matched to the measured one.","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2011.6085350","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075050/6085337/06085350.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2011.6085350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic rain attenuation model for adaptive satellite communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6085350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085350/","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic rain attenuation model for adaptive satellite communication systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387952","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6085350/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic rain attenuation model for adaptive satellite communication systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p74zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051476S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075050","isNumber":"6085337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075050","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6085337","articleId":"6085350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6085353,"authors":[{"name":"S.

System performance is analyzed and evaluated in terms of secondary users' blocking probability and mean transmission delay. For the RR strategy, a trellis-based mathematical analysis is proposed and developed for the calculation of the secondary users' mean total transmission delay. Considering that service time for secondary users is Coxian distributed, numerical results are shown to quantitatively compare the performance of the RR and RS retransmission strategies. It is found that the value of the coefficient of variation (CoV) of service time of SUs plays a major role in the system performance of cognitive radio networks under RR or RS strategies. For scenarios where the CoV of service time for SUs has values around 1, the RS strategy is preferred over the more complex RR strategy. On the contrary, as the CoV of the service time of SUs increases, the system performance improvement becomes significantly greater for the RR strategy relative to the RS strategy.","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2011.6085353","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075050/6085337/06085353.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2011.6085353","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","startPage":"51","endPage":"59","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of cognitive radio networks under Resume and Restart retransmission strategies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6085353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance of cognitive radio networks under Resume and Restart retransmission strategies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085353/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6085353/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387955","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of cognitive radio networks under Resume and Restart retransmission strategies","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p51castellanoslopez.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10728S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075050","isNumber":"6085337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075050","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6085337","articleId":"6085353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6085355,"authors":[{"name":"Rehana Kausar","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Rehana","lastName":"Kausar","id":"38231182800"},{"name":"Y.

The proposed ATDSA is implemented and validated in a dynamic packet scheduling framework via a system level simulation.

Iterative reception is an efficient way to approach optimal performance avoiding exhaustive algorithms. In such receivers using LDPC codes, complexity and delay could be critical since decoding and equalization tasks are repeated at each equalization loop. A LDPC decoder stops once it reaches a maximum number of iterations or fulfills a preset stopping criterion. In this paper we propose and evaluate the use of different stopping criteria based on reliability metrics to reduce the complexity and delay of the receiver by minimizing the total number of iterations while preserving the same performance.

The early-late gate (ELG) configuration is utilized to realize the proposed timing recovery scheme efficiently.

We develop a new method for obtaining turbo gains for unequally protected classes of bits by using a parallel concatenation of encoders separated by increasing size interleavers. A progressive and hierarchical encoding of the decreasing priority bits of one data frame is performed through consecutive partial rate-1 dimensions projections. The result is one data frame whose bits are encoded in a number of dimensions proportional to their respective priority in terms of channel sensitivity to errors. The iterative decoding algorithm is modified in consequence; turbo gains are consistent for all priority subframes during iterations and a noticeable increased gain is obtained for lower level bits. Performances for a two priority data frame are given in comparison with the classical structure of parallel turbo codes and recursive systematic convolutional code.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085377/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6085377/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387979","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Parallel progressive hierarchical turbo codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel progressive hierarchical turbo codes","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p346florea.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063051S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075050","isNumber":"6085337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075050","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6085337","articleId":"6085377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6085380,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Wei Shieh","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hong-Wei Shieh","id":"37087304049"},{"name":"Yinman Lee","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yinman Lee","id":"37087181094"},{"name":"Sok-Ian Sou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Sok-Ian Sou","id":"37087304318"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2014-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2013-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2012-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-4886"}],"articleNumber":"6085380","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"abstract":"Both zero-forcing (ZF) and maximum-likelihood (ML) criteria are widely used for signal detection in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) spatial multiplexing systems.

explores multiuser downlink beamforming in a distributed manner, where each user locally and sequentially optimizes its own beamforming phase and amplitude according to some performance measures. For phase optimization, the complex non-convex optimization problem is reformulated into a convex one. Given the optimal phase, the amplitude is pursued through the method of Lagrange multiplier. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm matches the conventional centralized two-user zero-forcing beamforming performance in terms of bit error rate. Meanwhile, our method utilizes 50% less feedback as compared to the conventional one.

Instead of using complex designs for exploiting frequency diversity and cancelling ICI, this paper explores how spreading signal, on either frequency-domain or time-domain, can improve the performance of OFDM systems. Based on the carrier interferometry technique, information symbols are spread over all the OFDM subcarriers to pursue frequency diversity. Then a packet retransmission scheme, which can be seem as spreading signal in time-domain, is proposed to suppress ICI. Numerical simulations show that frequency diversity can be pursued by spreading information symbols in OFDM subcarrier domain and that ICI can be suppressed by spreading packets in time domain. As a result, an enhanced OFDM system with low complexity signal spreading can be delivered.","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2011.6085395","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075050/6085337/06085395.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2011.6085395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085337","startPage":"255","endPage":"259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance enhancement of OFDM systems based on signal spreading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6085395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance enhancement of OFDM systems based on signal spreading","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085395/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387997","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6085395/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance enhancement of OFDM systems based on signal spreading","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p255juang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088155S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075050","isNumber":"6085337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075050","xplore-issue":"6085337","articleId":"6085395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6085396,"authors":[{"name":"Dorna Bandari","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Dorna","lastName":"Bandari","id":"38072952900"},{"name":"Gregory Pottie","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Pottie","id":"37272240500"},{"name":"Pascal Frossard","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Frossard","id":"37285156300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2014-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2013-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2012-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-4886"}],"articleNumber":"6085396","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"abstract":"In this work we propose a novel inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) and resource allocation method. Our aim is to maximize the rate of the worst performing user in all cells. We solve the problem in two phases, inter-cell and intra-cell resource management: first we define an ICIC scheme called interference concentration (ICon) in order to manage resources across cells, then each cell independently performs resource allocation to its users while meeting the constraints imposed by ICon. Finally, we adapt the ICIC method in order to balance the performance achieved in neighboring cells. Differently than Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR), ICon assigns received interference power limits, or the Interference Power Profiles (IPPs) rather than transmit power limits. The IPP determines the interference level the cell tolerates on each band. The intuition behind this change is that the interference to a given cell can be concentrated on a small band, resulting in more efficient use of bandwidth. In the intra-cell resource management phase, each cell allocates power and sub-bands to its users given their location in the cell, maximizing the minimum rate such that the IPP of none of its neighboring cells is violated. In order to balance the performance across all cells we use gradient-like updates to IPPs of cells. Finally we simulate an LTE-like system and compare the performance of our method with reuse 1, static FFR and SFR with proportionally fair scheduling of users in each cell. Static ICon achieves 18% higher 5 percentile rate than reuse 1 which was the best of these methods. Adaptive ICon is found to converge almost immediately, and adds an additional 11% to this gain.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075050/6085337/06085396.pdf","startPage":"249","endPage":"254","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2011.6085396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2011.6085396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6085396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ICon: Interference concentration for uplink in multicell OFDMA networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Resource management","Optimal scheduling","Base stations","Adaptation models","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","Long Term Evolution","mobility management (mobile radio)","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ICon","multicell OFDMA networks","inter-cell interference coordination","intracell resource management","intercell resource management","interference power profiles","LTE-like system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"ICon: Interference concentration for uplink in multicell OFDMA networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6085396/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387998","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ICon: Interference concentration for uplink in multicell OFDMA networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p249bandari.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090824S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075050","isNumber":"6085337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075050","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6085337","articleId":"6085396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6085397,"authors":[{"name":"Tomoya Onishi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoya","lastName":"Onishi","id":"38231958600"},{"name":"Md.

Recently, a blind CFO estimator based on the correlation of the received OFDM samples has been proposed. In this paper, this symbol-wise CFO estimator is extended to consider the presence of DC offset. Assuming a constant DC offset during one OFDM symbol period, we can roughly estimate the DC offset by averaging the whole symbol, and then removing it to perform the CFO estimation. Also, by rewriting the signals in matrix forms, we propose a new cost function which can be used to estimate the CFO free of DC offset. The validity of the proposed estimators is confirmed by simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind OFDM carrier frequency offset estimation in the presence of DC Offset","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2011.6085397","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075050/6085337/06085397.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2011.6085397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6085397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Blind OFDM carrier frequency offset estimation in the presence of DC Offset","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6085397/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12387999","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind OFDM carrier frequency offset estimation in the presence of DC Offset","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p245onishi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036851S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075050","isNumber":"6085337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075050","xplore-issue":"6085337","articleId":"6085397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6085399,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Tain","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, CN"],"lastName":"Lin Tain","id":"37087066041"},{"name":"Yiqing Zhou","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Mobile Computing and Pervasive Device, Beijing, China","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, china"],"lastName":"Yiqing Zhou","id":"37087064926"},{"name":"Juan Li","affiliation":["Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, china"],"lastName":"Juan Li","id":"37087064710"},{"name":"Yi Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, china"],"lastName":"Yi Huang","id":"37087073801"},{"name":"Jinglin Shi","affiliation":["Chongqing Jinmei Communication Company Limited, Chongqing, China","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, china"],"lastName":"Jinglin Shi","id":"37087065314"},{"name":"Jihua Zhou","affiliation":["Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of science, China","Chongqing Jinmei Communication Co., Ltd., Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Jihua Zhou","id":"37087065788"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2014-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2013-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2012-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-4886"}],"articleNumber":"6085399","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":885},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile computing","Wireless communication","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","mobility management (mobile radio)","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["seamless wireless connectivity","high-speed rail","broadband wireless communication systems","communication interruption time","dual-link system architecture","dual-layer system architecture","antennas","BS","Train Relay Station","handover failure probability scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High Speed Rail","Handover","LTE","Seamless"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6085399","abstract":"It is a great challenge to design an efficient handover scheme of broadband wireless communication systems for high-speed rail to reduce the communication interruption time during handover. A seamless handover scheme based on the dual-layer and dual-link system architecture is proposed in this paper. In the scheme, two antennas are mounted at the front and rear of a train, and one of them executes handover while the other is still communicating with BS. Therefore, the communication will not be interrupted throughout the handover. Furthermore, bi-casting is adopted to eliminate the data forwarding delay between the serving BS and target BS. In order to reduce handover implementation overhead, a Train Relay Station is employed to represent all the users in a train to execute handover in the proposed scheme. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed in terms of handover probability, handover failure probability and communication interruption probability. Simulation and theoretical results show that the proposed scheme can efficiently support seamless handover for high-speed trains with low implementation overhead.","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2011.6085399","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075050/6085337/06085399.pdf","startPage":"230","endPage":"236","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2011.6085399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel handover scheme for seamless wireless connectivity in high-speed rail","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085399/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A novel handover scheme for seamless wireless connectivity in high-speed rail","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12388001","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6085399/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel handover scheme for seamless wireless connectivity in high-speed rail","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p230tian.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064286S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075050","isNumber":"6085337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075050","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6085337","articleId":"6085399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6085404,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Hee Lee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin-Hee Lee","id":"37087304959"},{"name":"Young-Chai Ko","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Chai Ko","id":"37087289608"},{"name":"Seyeong Choi","affiliation":["Electrical Information Communication Engineering, Wonkwang University, Jeonbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seyeong Choi","id":"37087304612"},{"name":"Hong-Chuan Yang","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Hong-Chuan Yang","id":"37087156189"},{"name":"Sungjin Kim","affiliation":["SAIT, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Kyoundki, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sungjin Kim","id":"37087303656"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2014-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2013-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2012-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-4886"}],"articleNumber":"6085404","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Interference","Wireless communication","MIMO","Vectors","Signal to noise ratio","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","cooperative communication","encoding","feedback","MIMO communication","multi-access systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinated multicell MU-MIMO downlink transmission","adaptive beam deactivation","multiuser multiple input multiple output downlink system","limited feedback","codebook","channel quality indicator","feedback information","transmitting user set selection algorithm","coordinating base station","sum rate gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-cell wireless system","inter-cell interference","cell cooperation","adaptive beam deactivation","zeroforcing beamforming"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated multi-cell MU-MIMO downlink transmission with adaptive beam deactivation","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2011.6085404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085337","endPage":"203","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075050/6085337/06085404.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2011.6085404","startPage":"199","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6085404","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an adaptive beam deactivation scheme for the coordinated multi-cell multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) downlink system with limited feedback.

This paper describes SenGuard, a user identification framework that enables continuous and implicit user identification service for smartphone. Different from traditional active user authentication and access control, SenGuard leverages availability of multiple sensors on today's smartphones and passively use sensor inputs as sources of user authentication. It extracts sensor modality dependent user identification features from captured sensor data and performs user identification at background. SenGuard invokes active user authentication when there is a mounting evidence that the phone user has changed. In addition, SenGuard uses a novel virtualization based system architecture as a safeguard to prevent subversion of the background user identification mechanism by moving it into a privileged virtual domain. An initial prototype of SenGuard was created using four sensor modalities including, voice, location, multitouch, and locomotion. Preliminary empirical studies with a set of users indicate that those four modalities are suited as data sources for implicit mobile user identification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085412/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12388014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6085412/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"SenGuard: Passive user identification on smartphones using multiple sensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SenGuard: Passive user identification on smartphones using multiple sensors","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p141shi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070497S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075050","isNumber":"6085337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075050","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6085337","articleId":"6085412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6085512,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Boehmer","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Machines, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Boehmer"},{"name":"Tim Cramer","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Machines, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Cramer"},{"name":"Martin Hafner","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Machines, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Hafner"},{"name":"Enno Lange","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Machines, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Enno","lastName":"Lange"},{"name":"Kay Hameyer","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Machines, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Kay","lastName":"Hameyer"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-84919-468-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6085512","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"abstract":"In this paper, an hybrid parallelisation approach for the simulation of nonlinear electromagnetic problems by means of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and the OpenMP Application Program Interface for the Finite Element Method (FEM) is investigated.

A short review of approaches to reduce fluctuation of forces presented in literature is given. As the reduction is associated in most cases with a negative influence on other important design goals, multi-objective optimizations are applied in conjunction with the finite element analysis yielding PARETO-optimal solutions with different preferences. PARETO-optimal solutions regarding the permanent magnet magnetization distribution and the current profiles minimizing the torque fluctuation of a 12-slot 8-pole machine and the higher frequency radial force harmonics in a 12-slot 10-pole machine are presented and discussed. A discrete PARETO-optimal magnetization distribution has been identified which promises a higher fundamental PM flux linkage amplitude compared to radial magnetization, but at a significantly lower cogging torque and torque ripple utilizing the balancing of open circuit voltage harmonics. Furthermore, it is shown that individual current harmonics affect individual radial force harmonics dominantly. A test setup is proposed and the numerically obtained instantaneous torque and the influence of current harmonics on the radial force amplitudes are verified with good agreement.","doi":"10.1109/EDPC.2011.6085546","pdfPath":"/iel5/6077127/6085524/06085546.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"48","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 1st International Electric Drives Production Conference","publicationTitle":"2011 1st International Electric Drives Production Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDPC.2011.6085546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of torque and radial force fluctuation in permanent magnet synchronous motors by means of multi-objective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of torque and radial force fluctuation in permanent magnet synchronous motors by means of multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12388177","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6085546/","conferenceDate":"28-29 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of torque and radial force fluctuation in permanent magnet synchronous motors by means of multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"42KrotschReductionTorque.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103251S","chronDate":"28-29 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6077127","isNumber":"6085524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6077127","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6085524","articleId":"6085546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6085583,"authors":[{"name":"Amitava Ghosh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/6203631/6085583/6085583-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amitava Ghosh (S'09) received the M.Tech. degree in microelectronics and very large-scale integrated (VLSI) design from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India, in 2007, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","He is associated with the Advanced VLSI Design Laboratory, IIT Kharagpur.

The proposed technique is a variant of the binary frequency shift keying and is based on the principle that even though the frequency values of a radio frequency (RF) tone-pair of an oscillator may vary under various environmental conditions, the difference between the frequencies remains largely invariant. The proposed DFSK technique significantly relaxes the frequency stability requirement in the transmitter RF front-end at the cost of a little increased transmission power, which, in turn, significantly simplifies the circuit complexity as well as reduces the overall circuit power consumption within the transmitter. Theoretical analyses of the bit error rate, phase noise, interferer effects, and energy consumption for DFSK have been provided, supplemented by the simulation results using detailed MATLAB modeling for the medical implant communications service frequency band.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267003/6203631/06085583.pdf","startPage":"305","endPage":"316","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6203631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2011.2173612","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2011.2173612","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6085583","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency shift keying","Radio frequency","Wireless sensor networks","Oscillators","Receivers","Microwave integrated circuits","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical communication","body area networks","detector circuits","frequency shift keying","prosthetics","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable RF carrier modulation","ultralow power wireless body area network","modulation technique","differential frequency shift keying","ultralow power wireless sensor node","energy efficient transmission technique","short distance wireless communication system","binary frequency shift keying","radio frequency tone pair","oscillator","circuit complexity","circuit power consumption","medical implant communications service frequency band"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential frequency shift keying (DFSK)","medical implant communications service (MICS) band","modulation","ultralow power","wireless body area networks","wireless sensor node"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085583/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Variable RF Carrier Modulation Scheme for Ultralow Power Wireless Body-Area Network","accessionNumber":"12850655","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6085583/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Variable RF Carrier Modulation Scheme for Ultralow Power Wireless Body-Area Network","sourcePdf":"jsyst-ghosh-2173612-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11773S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"6203631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6203631","articleId":"6085583","onlineDate":"21 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":6085601,"authors":[{"name":"S.

When multispectral images having \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</i>\n spectral bands are considered, an effective solution to this problem is to exploit all available spectral channels in the framework of supervised or partially supervised approaches. However, in many real applications, it is difficult/impossible to collect ground truth information for either multitemporal or single-date images. On the opposite, unsupervised methods available in the literature are not effective in handling the full information present in multispectral and multitemporal images. They usually consider a simplified subspace of the original feature space having small dimensionality and, thus, characterized by a possible loss of change information. In this paper, we present a framework for the detection of multiple changes in bitemporal and multispectral remote sensing images that allows one to overcome the limits of standard unsupervised methods. The framework is based on the following: 1) a compressed yet efficient 2-D representation of the change information and 2) a two-step automatic decision strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been tested on two bitemporal and multispectral data sets having different properties. Results obtained on both data sets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2171493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6200913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2171493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6200913/06085609.pdf","startPage":"2196","endPage":"2212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for Automatic and Unsupervised Detection of Multiple Changes in Multitemporal Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Automatic and Unsupervised Detection of Multiple Changes in Multitemporal Images","volume":"50","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6085609/","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12728346","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085609/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for Automatic and Unsupervised Detection of Multiple Changes in Multitemporal Images","sourcePdf":"tgrs-bovolo-2171493-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124649S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6200913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"6200913","articleId":"6085609","onlineDate":"21 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6085611,"authors":[{"name":"Karun Rawat","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6230687/6085611/6085611-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Karun Rawat (M'08\u2013S'09) received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Meerut University, Meerut, India, in 2002.

However, it has been shown that scalar quantization of oversampled or compressively sensed signals can be inefficient in terms of the rate-distortion tradeoff, especially as the oversampling rate or the sparsity of the signal increases. In this paper, we modify the scalar quantizer to have discontinuous quantization regions. We demonstrate that with this modification it is possible to achieve exponential decay of the quantization error as a function of the oversampling rate instead of the quadratic decay exhibited by current approaches. Our approach is universal in the sense that prior knowledge of the signal model is not necessary in the quantizer design, only in the reconstruction. Thus, we demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the quantization error by incorporating side information on the acquired signal, such as sparse signal models or signal similarity with known signals. In doing so, we establish a relationship between quantization performance and the Kolmogorov entropy of the signal model.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2173899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6157047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2173899","endPage":"1872","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6157047/06085612.pdf","startPage":"1861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal Rate-Efficient Scalar Quantization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085612/","displayDocTitle":"Universal Rate-Efficient Scalar Quantization","volume":"58","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"12557601","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6085612/","publicationDate":"March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal Rate-Efficient Scalar Quantization","sourcePdf":"tit-boufounos-2173899-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118459S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6157047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6157047","articleId":"6085612","onlineDate":"21 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6085626,"authors":[{"name":"Yingpeng Sang","affiliation":["School of Computers and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, BJTU, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6085621/6085626/6085626-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yingpeng Sang received the BE degree in computer science from Southwest Jiaotong University, China, in 2001, the ME degree in computer science from the Institute of Mobile Communications, Southwest Jiaotong University, in 2004, and the PhD degree in computer science from the Japan Advance Institute of Science and Technology, in 2007.

It was shown in [33] that, if the original data set composed of m attributes is multiplied by a mixing matrix of k\\times m (m>;k) which is random and orthogonal on expectation, then the k series of perturbed data can be released for mining purposes. Given the data perturbed by RP and some necessary prior knowledge, to our knowledge, little work has been done in reconstructing the original data to recover some sensitive information. In this paper, we choose several typical scenarios in data mining with different assumptions on prior knowledge. For the cases that an attacker has full or zero knowledge of the mixing matrix R, respectively, we propose reconstruction methods based on Underdetermined Independent Component Analysis (UICA) if the attributes of the original data are mutually independent and sparse, and propose reconstruction methods based on Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) if the attributes of the original data are correlated and nonsparse. Simulation results show that our reconstructions achieve high recovery rates, and outperform the reconstructions based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Successful reconstructions essentially mean the leakage of privacy, so our work identify the possible risks of RP when it is used for data perturbations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6085621/06085626.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2011.83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2011.83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085621","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6085626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective Reconstruction of Data Perturbed by Random Projections","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Covariance matrix","Distributed databases","Principal component analysis","Sparse matrices","Vectors","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","data privacy","independent component analysis","perturbation techniques","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random projections","privacy-preserving data mining","Euclidean distances","mixing matrix","underdetermined independent component analysis","principal component analysis","data perturbation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Privacy-preserving data mining","data perturbation","data reconstruction","underdetermined independent component analysis","Maximum A Posteriori","principal component analysis."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085626/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Effective Reconstruction of Data Perturbed by Random Projections","volume":"61","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6085626/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12388241","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective Reconstruction of Data Perturbed by Random Projections","sourcePdf":"ttc2012010101.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13981S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6085621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6085621","articleId":"6085626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6085669,"authors":[{"name":"Gilney Damm","affiliation":["IBISC, Universit\u00e9 d'Evry Val d'Essonne, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Gilney","lastName":"Damm","id":"37360976000"},{"name":"Van Cuong Nguyen","affiliation":["IBISC, Universit\u00e9 d'Evry Val d'Essonne, Evry, France"],"lastName":"Van Cuong Nguyen","id":"38230175200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-973-621-321-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1173-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-973-621-323-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6085669","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6085669","abstract":"This work develops a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Conditional Integrator (CI) controller to a class of MIMO nonlinear systems, in the case of asymptotically constant references, motivated by airspace applications.

This problem is challenging due to the large variations of these components features (size, shape, orientation or texture). In this paper we improve the technique presented in [17] used to identify the epithelial nuclei (crypt) against interstitial nuclei in microscopic images taken from colon tissues. In the proposed enhanced approach, the crypt inner boundary is detected using the closing morphological pyramid instead of morphological hierarchy. The outer crypt border is determined by the epithelial nuclei, overlapped by the maximal isoline of the inner boundary. The use of sampling in building the pyramid offers computational efficiency, reduces the amount of used memory, increase the robustness and preserve the quality results. An analysis of the two approaches is performed considering the number of pixels processed to create each level. Also the relation between the levels of the hierarchical structures is established.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6085686/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12390392","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sampling step importance in hierarchical semantic segmentation of microscopic images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling step importance in hierarchical semantic segmentation of microscopic images","confLoc":"Sinaia, Romania","sourcePdf":"icstcc2011submission074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054792S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6078720","isNumber":"6085648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6078720","xplore-issue":"6085648","articleId":"6085686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICSTCC","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6085728,"authors":[{"name":"Andrei Amariutei","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Andrei","lastName":"Amariutei","id":"38230224800"},{"name":"Simona Caraiman","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Simona","lastName":"Caraiman","id":"37395219700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-973-621-321-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1173-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-973-621-323-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6085728","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":808},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantum computing","Graphics processing unit","Computational modeling","Registers","Computers","Instruction sets","Quantum cascade lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","parallel programming","quantum computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel quantum computer simulation","GPU","high performance computing capability","graphical processing unit","parallel implementation","QC-lib quantum computer simulator","CUDA programming model","quantum register"]}],"abstract":"Simulation of quantum computers using classical computers is a hard problem with high memory and computational requirements. Parallelization can alleviate this problem, allowing the simulation of more qubits at the same time or the same number of qubits to be simulated in less time. A promising approach is to exploit the high performance computing capabilities provided by the latest graphical processing units. In this paper we present a parallel implementation of the QC-lib quantum computer simulator on the GPU using the CUDA programming model. The proposed scheme for partitioning the terms that describe the state of a quantum register takes advantage of the specific characteristics of the CUDA memory spaces and allows for an efficient parallelization of the general singe qubit operator. Experimental results indicate that very good speed-ups can be obtained in contrast with the sequential implementation.","publicationTitle":"15th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"15th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6078720/6085648/06085728.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel quantum computer simulation on the GPU","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6085728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085728/","displayDocTitle":"Parallel quantum computer simulation on the GPU","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12390433","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6085728/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel quantum computer simulation on the GPU","confLoc":"Sinaia, Romania","sourcePdf":"icstcc2011submission127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096562S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6078720","isNumber":"6085648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6078720","xplore-issue":"6085648","articleId":"6085728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICSTCC","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6085778,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Cachin","firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Cachin","id":"37273091000"},{"name":"Matthias Schunter","firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Schunter","id":"37324200700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9235"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9340"}],"articleNumber":"6085778","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2498},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6085778","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computer security","Virtual machining","Privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer crime","data privacy","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Amazon elastic compute cloud service","customer Websites","hackers","Sony PlayStation network","software glitch","cloud storage provider","Dropbox","privacy rights clearinghouse"]}],"abstract":"This past April, Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud service crashed during a system upgrade, knocking customers' websites off-line for anywhere from several hours to several days.

The proposed database in this paper is used to estimate the received signal power of a primary user (PU) at a certain location by secondary users (SU). The received signal power is measured by the measurement nodes such as vehicles at different locations and is mapped in the database together with the information regarding the number of observations. Considering the Rayleigh fading characteristics in the stored data, we investigate the required margin for proper protection of the PU from the interference created by a SU. Through simulations, we show the relationship between the required number of observations at a certain location and the performance attained by the SU while also protecting the rights of the primary systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085820/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12390331","htmlLink":"/document/6085820/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Measurement based radio environment database using spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement based radio environment database using spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p110hasan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048998S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6072552","isNumber":"6085806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6072552","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6085806","articleId":"6085820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6085836,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Hwui Chung","affiliation":["Department of EE and Graduate Institute Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Hwui","lastName":"Chung","id":"37405614900"},{"name":"See-May Phoong","affiliation":["Department of EE and Graduate Institute Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"See-May","lastName":"Phoong","id":"37266374400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2002-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2003-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6085836","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synchronization","Maximum likelihood estimation","Base stations","Vectors","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","sequences","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity carrier frequency synchronization","OFDMA uplink transmissions","multiple carrier frequency offsets","training sequences","maximum likelihood CFO estimator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","CFO","Uplink Synchronization","Training Sequences"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the estimation of multiple carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) in a uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system using training sequences.

This topic became an important problem and is solved as a global threat across several scientific disciplines. Terrorist attacks have been practiced by a wide array of organizations or groups for achieving their objectives. We can include political parties, nationalistic and religious groups, revolutionaries, ruling governments or others. Due to this fact the need of observing and discovering relations and rules of behavior based on terrorism incidents becomes very important. The authors of the paper present the usage of clustering methods and association rule mining methods for discovering and representation of potentially interesting similarities in the data. The purpose of the paper is to model synthetic social network based on relations obtained from the data about terroristic incidents to facilitate visual investigation of similarities in data and to study the network evolution during the years.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085907","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks (CASoN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks (CASoN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6082090/6085907/06085954.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CASON.2011.6085954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASON.2011.6085954","startPage":"255","endPage":"260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual investigation of similarities in Global Terrorism Database by means of synthetic social networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6085954/","displayDocTitle":"Visual investigation of similarities in Global Terrorism Database by means of synthetic social networks","htmlLink":"/document/6085954/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12405289","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual investigation of similarities in Global Terrorism Database by means of synthetic social networks","confLoc":"Salamanca, Spain","sourcePdf":"rp47P87.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115523S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6082090","isNumber":"6085907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082090","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6085907","articleId":"6085954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6086121,"authors":[{"name":"Lihong Zhang","affiliation":["Fundamentals Department, Chinese People's Armed Police Force Academy, Langfang, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Lihong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38240230700"},{"name":"Hong Liu","affiliation":["Fundamentals Department, Chinese People's Armed Police Force Academy, Langfang, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086656174"},{"name":"Xiaomei Guo","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaomei","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085854101"},{"name":"Wenhua Yu","affiliation":["University Park, Penn State University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Wenhua","lastName":"Yu","id":"37279840400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1540-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4501-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6086121","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Magnetic fields","Time domain analysis","Acceleration","Computational modeling","Registers","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VALU","FDTD","CPML","parallel technique"]}],"abstract":"This article introduces a novel hardware acceleration technique based on Vector Arithmetic Logic Unit (VALU) built in a regular CPU for parallel Finite-Difference Time-Domain(FDTD) simulation with Convolutional Perfect Matched Layer(CPML) absorbing boundary condition (ABC), and gives an implementation on PC.

So we describe a multi-threaded parallel design and implementation of the Smith-Waterman (SW) on CUDA to reduce execution time. And according the architecure of CUDA, we have divided the computation of a whole pair wise sequence alignment scoring matrix into multiple sub-matrices, using 32 threads to process on submatrice, more over we optimized memory distribution scheme, and used reduction to find the maximum element of the alignment scoring matrix.

With the popularity and the variety of malware over the Internet, generating their signatures for detecting via anti-virus (AV) scan engines becomes an important reactive security function. However, AV security products consume much of the PC memory and resources due to their large signature files. AV cloud computing becomes a popular solution for this problem. In this paper, a novel automatic malware signature discovery system for AV cloud (AMSDS) is proposed to generate malware signatures from both static and dynamic aspects. Our experiment on millions-scale samples indicates that AMSDS outperforms most automatic signature generation techniques of both industry and academia. The detection model of malware signature can provides research thinking for anti-virus technology to improve and enhance, especially on detecting and preventing unknown viruses or malware signature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Detection Model of Malware Signature for Anti-virus Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"2011 10th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","doi":"10.1109/ICIS.2011.73","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/6085647/6086439/06086451.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIS.2011.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6086439","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6086451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Detection Model of Malware Signature for Anti-virus Cloud Computing","conferenceDate":"16-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6086451/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Detection Model of Malware Signature for Anti-virus Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"4401a073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0397S","chronDate":"16-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6085647","isNumber":"6086439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6085647","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6086439","articleId":"6086451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6086476,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Ouyang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Ouyang","id":"37086650582"},{"name":"Changcheng Ruan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Changcheng","lastName":"Ruan","id":"37086647835"},{"name":"Lingxiang Zheng","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Lingxiang","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37086646426"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0141-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6086476","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6086476","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Parity check codes","Generators","Multimedia communication","Field programmable gate arrays","Registers","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC codes","DTMB","SRAA circuit","partially-parallel encoding"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an implementation of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) encoder is introduced, which meets the demand of Chinese Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcasting (DTMB) standard.

Distributed memory database technologies provide a means for easily store mass data in cloud in a dynamic and scalable manner. This paper argues for a new architecture called CDSA, which is a distributed memory NoSQL database architecture for Cloud computing to improve the performance of querying data and ensure mass data storage in cloud by using rational strategy. Furthermore, add or deleted any node from the distributed database cluster, the others node can work without stop service. We believe that CDSA can provide durable storage with high throughput and lower access latency.","doi":"10.1109/ICIS.2011.61","publicationTitle":"2011 10th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/6085647/6086439/06086493.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIS.2011.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6086439","startPage":"351","endPage":"355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Solution of Distributed Memory NoSQL Database for Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6086493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Solution of Distributed Memory NoSQL Database for Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086493/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6086493/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Solution of Distributed Memory NoSQL Database for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"4401a351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052082S","chronDate":"16-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6085647","isNumber":"6086439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6085647","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6086439","articleId":"6086493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6086500,"authors":[{"name":"Le Guan","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Guan","id":"37086716064"},{"name":"Xu Ke","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Ke","id":"37086716734"},{"name":"Meina Song","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Meina","lastName":"Song","id":"37278155400"},{"name":"Junde Song","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junde","lastName":"Song","id":"37277429900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0141-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6086500","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":88,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":5255},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Research on Mobile Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/6085647/6086439/06086500.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"392","publicationTitle":"2011 10th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIS.2011.67","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6086439","doi":"10.1109/ICIS.2011.67","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Cloud computing","Context","Mobile handsets","Computational modeling","Mobile computing","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile cloud computing","application partition","offloading","context-aware"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6086500","abstract":"The rapid development of mobile computing and cloud computing trigger novel computing paradigm-----Mobile Cloud Computing.

Most of the current data forwarding schemes choose the nodes with the best cumulative capability of contacting others as relays to carry and forward data, but these nodes may not be the best relay choices within a short time period due to the heterogeneity of transient node contact characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the performance of data forwarding with a short time constraint in DTNs by exploiting the transient social contact patterns. These patterns represent the transient characteristics of contact distribution, network connectivity and social community structure in DTNs, and we provide analytical formulations on these patterns based on experimental studies of realistic DTN traces. We then propose appropriate forwarding metrics based on these patterns to improve the effectiveness of data forwarding. When applied to various data forwarding strategies, our proposed forwarding metrics achieve much better performance compared to existing schemes with similar forwarding cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13136689","htmlLink":"/document/6086545/","displayDocTitle":"On Exploiting Transient Social Contact Patterns for Data Forwarding in Delay-Tolerant Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Exploiting Transient Social Contact Patterns for Data Forwarding in Delay-Tolerant Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2013010151.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113786S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6355922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"6355922","articleId":"6086545","onlineDate":"22 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6086546,"authors":[{"name":"Jang-Ping Sheu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6355922/6086546/6086546-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jang-Ping Sheu received the BS degree in computer science from Tamkang University, Taiwan, Republic of China, in 1981, and the MS and PhD degrees in computer science from National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, Republic of China, in 1983 and 1987, respectively.

To find the near-optimal solutions to this type of maximization problem in polynomial time, this study first proposes a greedy weighted algorithm, GWA, for bandwidth allocation. By incorporating table-consulting mechanisms, the proposed GWA can intelligently avoid redundant bandwidth allocation and thus accomplish high network performance (such as high network throughput or large number of satisfied users). To maintain the high performance gained by GWA and simultaneously improve its worst case performance, this study extends GWA to a bounded version, BGWA, which guarantees that its performance gains are lower bounded. This study shows that the computational complexity of BGWA is also in polynomial time and proves that BGWA can provide at least 1/\u03c1 times the performance of the optimal solution, where \\rho is a finite value no less than one. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed BGWA bandwidth allocation scheme can effectively achieve different performance objectives with different parameter settings.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6355922/06086546.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6355922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Resource Allocation Scheme for Scalable Video Multicast in WiMAX Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6086546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086546/","displayDocTitle":"A Resource Allocation Scheme for Scalable Video Multicast in WiMAX Relay Networks","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13136690","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6086546/","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Resource Allocation Scheme for Scalable Video Multicast in WiMAX Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2013010090.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085927S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6355922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6355922","articleId":"6086546","onlineDate":"22 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6086549,"authors":[{"name":"Miao Pan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Texas Southern University, Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6335093/6086549/6086549-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Miao Pan received the BSc degree in electrical engineering from the Dalian University of Technology, China, in 2004, the MASc degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2007, and the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, in 2012, respectively.

However, due to the unpredictable activities of primary services, the SSP may suffer the monetary risk or failure to meet the traffic demands from the secondary users (SUs). It is challenging for the SSP to measure the risk for OSA, to choose the bands to use, and to split the traffic on the band-mix, when there are multiple vacant bands from PSPs. In this paper, we first introduce the X loss, an intuitive measurement for the risk for OSA. Although the X loss is attractively simple, it underestimates the potential risk for OSA and is mathematically not subadditive, which makes it difficult to support the band-mix selection for traffic splitting. To overcome this problem, we propose a more suitable risk measurement, which is subadditive and consistent with the SSP's perception of the risk. Based on the proposed risk metric, we formulate the band-mix selection problem as an optimization problem and solve it by linear programming.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6086549/","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13064176","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The X Loss: Band-Mix Selection for Opportunistic Spectrum Accessing with Uncertain Spectrum Supply from Primary Service Providers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The X Loss: Band-Mix Selection for Opportunistic Spectrum Accessing with Uncertain Spectrum Supply from Primary Service Providers","sourcePdf":"ttm2012122133.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.22011S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6335093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6335093","articleId":"6086549","onlineDate":"22 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6086556,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Hwa Liao","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Tatung University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6189422/6086556/6086556-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wen-Hwa Liao (M'03) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science and information engineering from National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan, in 1992 and 2002, respectively.","He was a Visiting Scholar with the University of Louisiana, Lafayette, from October 2001 to May 2002.

The long propagation delay of acoustic signals in UWSN causes spatial-temporal uncertainty making spatial fairness in UWSN a challenging problem. Time of arrival of the packets depends on both the sending time and the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. Hence, it is difficult to avoid collision and guarantee the fairness of transmission in underwater environment. In this paper, we propose a spatially fair multiple access control (SF-MAC) protocol called SF-MAC in UWSN. The SF-MAC can avoid collision by postponing the clear-to-send frame equal to period of request-to-send (RTS) contention period. The receiver collects RTSs from all the contenders during the RTS contention period and calculates the potential sending time of each of contender. It determines the earliest transmitter with a probability rule that compares with the first RTS. In case of multiple contenders, the SF-MAC can maintain a more exact order of transmission to achieve fairness of transmission. Finally, we present a comprehensive performance study via simulations. The results show that SF-MAC can perform better than existing MAC schemes (such as MACA, MACA-U, and T-Lohi) in terms of the spatial fairness and network throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086556/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2011","volume":"12","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"12692259","publicationDate":"June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6086556/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SF-MAC: A Spatially Fair MAC Protocol for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SF-MAC: A Spatially Fair MAC Protocol for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-liao-2177083-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051337S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6189422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6189422","articleId":"6086556","onlineDate":"22 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6086558,"authors":[{"name":"Richard R.

To cope with the lack of centralized control and local influences, we propose two special cases of local interaction game to study this problem. The first is local altruistic game, in which each user considers the payoffs of itself as well as its neighbors rather than considering itself only. The second is local congestion game, in which each user minimizes the number of competing neighbors. It is shown that with the proposed games, global optimization is achieved with local information. Specifically, the local altruistic game maximizes the network throughput and the local congestion game minimizes the network collision level. Also, the concurrent spatial adaptive play (C-SAP), which is an extension of the existing spatial adaptive play (SAP), is proposed to achieve the global optimum both autonomously as well as rapidly.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2176916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6167334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2176916","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6167334/06086561.pdf","startPage":"180","endPage":"194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks: Global Optimization Using Local Interaction Games","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks: Global Optimization Using Local Interaction Games","volume":"6","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6086561/","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12578203","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086561/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks: Global Optimization Using Local Interaction Games","sourcePdf":"jstsp-xu-2176916-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14187S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6167334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"201","xplore-issue":"6167334","articleId":"6086561","onlineDate":"22 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6086563,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamad I.

In addition to sparsity knowledge, we use a statistical characterization of the observed signal to further improve system performance.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2011.2177086","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/6071747/06086569.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2011.2177086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6071747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Sensing With Nonlinear Analog Mapping in a Noisy Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6086569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086569/","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Sensing With Nonlinear Analog Mapping in a Noisy Environment","volume":"19","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12384683","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6086569/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Sensing With Nonlinear Analog Mapping in a Noisy Environment","sourcePdf":"lsp-abousaleh-2177086-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050119S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6071747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6071747","articleId":"6086569","onlineDate":"22 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6086581,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Medina","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation, German AeroSpace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6268389/6086581/6086581-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Medina received the master's degree in telecommunications engineering from the Technical University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria, in 2011.","He has been working for the German Aerospace Center (DLR) as a Research Engineer with the Institute of Communications and Navigation in Oberpfaffenhofen near Munich, Germany.

We propose a rate model and a quality model, both in terms of the quantization stepsize and frame rate. Both models are expressed as the product of separate functions of quantization stepsize and frame rate. The proposed models are analytically tractable, each requiring only a few content-dependent parameters. The rate model is validated over videos coded using both scalable and nonscalable encoders, under a variety of encoder settings. The quality model is validated only for a scalable video, although it is expected to be applicable to a single-layer video as well. We further investigate how to predict the model parameters using the content features extracted from original videos. Results show accurate bit rate and quality prediction (average Pearson correlation >;0.99) can be achieved with model parameters predicted using three features. Finally, we apply rate and quality models for rate-constrained scalable bitstream adaptation and frame rate adaptive rate control. Simulations show that our model-based solutions produce better video quality compared with conventional video adaptation and rate control.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of Rate and Perceptual Quality of Compressed Video as Functions of Frame Rate and Quantization Stepsize and Its Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2177143","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6193248/06086602.pdf","startPage":"671","endPage":"682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2177143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6193248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6086602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086602/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of Rate and Perceptual Quality of Compressed Video as Functions of Frame Rate and Quantization Stepsize and Its Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6086602/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12695194","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of Rate and Perceptual Quality of Compressed Video as Functions of Frame Rate and Quantization Stepsize and Its Applications","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-ma-2177143-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068948S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6193248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"6193248","articleId":"6086602","onlineDate":"22 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6086610,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Johansson","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/6214970/6086610/6086610-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Markus Johansson received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from The Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree from Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2011.","His research interests include computational electromagnetics and dosimetry."]},"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Johansson","id":"38015263400"},{"name":"Hoi-Shun Lui","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/6214970/6086610/6086610-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Hoi-Shun Lui (S'06\u2013M'09) received the Bachelor of Engineering (first class Hons.) and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, in 2003 and 2008, respectively.","While he was a Ph.D. candidate, he carried out consultancy work with Filtronics Australia Ltd.

We here present a phase-retrieval method that uses an optimization algorithm based on the phase angle gradients of a functional. Numerical test cases have shown that the method is working for different initial phase distributions as well as different placements of the source. The method also works well for a test case with measured 50 Hz magnetic flux density from a transformer. The obtained phase angles on a measurement plane in front of the transformer gave calculated field amplitudes on other measurement planes that agree well with measured field. The ratios between the largest amplitude difference and the largest measured amplitude for the three Cartesian magnetic flux density components, for one of the planes, are for example 6.62%, 9.51% and 6.40%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase measurement","Antenna measurements","Electromagnetics","Electromagnetic compatibility","Dosimetry","Wavelength measurement","Surface waves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","dosimetry","magnetic flux","magnetic variables measurement","optimisation","phase measurement","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source modeling","phaseless low-frequency near-field measurements","amplitude-only measurements","dosimetry applications","electromagnetic compatibility investigations","far-field transformations","antenna diagnostics","phase-retrieval method","phase angle gradients","initial phase distributions","Cartesian magnetic flux density components","transformer","optimization algorithm","frequency 50 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex source modeling","electromagnetic dosimetry","electromagnetic measurements","inverse problem","optimization methods"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2011.2171056","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/6214970/06086610.pdf","startPage":"613","endPage":"624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6214970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2011.2171056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Source Modeling Using Phaseless Low-Frequency Near-Field Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6086610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Source Modeling Using Phaseless Low-Frequency Near-Field Measurements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086610/","volume":"54","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6086610/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12785413","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source Modeling Using Phaseless Low-Frequency Near-Field Measurements","sourcePdf":"temc-johansson-2171056-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120094S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"6214970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6214970","articleId":"6086610","onlineDate":"22 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6086614,"authors":[{"name":"Maurizio Martina","affiliation":["VLSI Laboratory, Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6165484/6086614/6086614-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maurizio Martina (S'98\u2013M'05) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy, in 2000 and 2004, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with the VLSI Laboratory, Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Torino.

In particular, first, a unified framework for the so-called generalized max* operation is established, which includes most of the previously published algorithms already known for turbo decoding. Next, the hardware architectures used for the practical implementation of the generalized max* operation, which is derived from this novel framework, are revealed for the first time and further analyzed, in terms of hardware complexity reduction. It is also shown how this generalized max8 operation can be adopted in LDPC decoding, achieving essentially optimal bit error rate performance with small computational complexity against other algorithms in joint turbo-LDPC architectures. This solution is useful in applications where joint decoding architectures are deployed to decode both turbo and LDPC codes. An important example of such application is in software radio receivers of 4G wireless communication systems, such as those proposed in conjunction with the WiMAX standard.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2173045","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6165484/06086614.pdf","startPage":"888","endPage":"895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2173045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Practical Implementation and Generalizations of - Operator for Turbo and LDPC Decoders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6086614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"On Practical Implementation and Generalizations of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$ \\max^{\\ast}$</tex></formula> Operator for Turbo and LDPC Decoders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086614/","publicationDate":"April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12576948","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6086614/","volume":"61","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Practical Implementation and Generalizations of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$ \\max^{\\ast}$</tex></formula> Operator for Turbo and LDPC Decoders","sourcePdf":"tim-martina-2173045-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089977S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6165484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6165484","articleId":"6086614","onlineDate":"22 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6086618,"authors":[{"name":"Francesc Auli-Llinas","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6170603/6086618/6086618-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesc Aul\u00ed-Llin\u00e0s (S'06\u2013M'08) received the B.Sc. and B.E. degrees in computer management engineering and computer engineering in 2000 and 2002, respectively, both from the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (Spain), and for which he was granted with two extraordinary awards of Bachelor (awards given to the first students of the promotion).

We consider two different formulations of the deblurring problem, i.e., one given by the minimization of the single-objective function and another based on the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) balance of two objective functions. The latter results in the algorithm where deblurring and denoising operations are decoupled. The convergence of the developed algorithms is proved.

We employ a large and rich set of feature descriptors (with more than 70 000 descriptors) for face identification using partial least squares to perform multichannel feature weighting. Then, we extend the method to a tree-based discriminative structure to reduce the time required to evaluate probe samples. The method is evaluated on Facial Recognition Technology (FERET) and Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) data sets. Experiments show that our identification method outperforms current state-of-the-art results, particularly for identifying faces acquired across varying conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Vectors","Probes","Feature extraction","Face recognition","Training","Lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","least squares approximations","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face identification task","uncontrolled environments","training data","partial least squares","multichannel feature weighting","tree-based discriminative structure","facial recognition technology","FERET","face recognition grand challenge data sets","FRGC data sets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face identification","feature combination","feature selection","partial least squares (PLS)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Biometry","Face","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Subtraction Technique"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2176951","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6170603/06086621.pdf","startPage":"2245","endPage":"2255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2176951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Identification Using Large Feature Sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6086621","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Face Identification Using Large Feature Sets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086621/","volume":"21","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6086621/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12615459","pubMedId":"22128005","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Identification Using Large Feature Sets","sourcePdf":"tip-schwartz-2176951-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08196S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6170603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6170603","articleId":"6086621","onlineDate":"22 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6086627,"authors":[{"name":"Yiran Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6170997/6086627/6086627-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiran Li received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2003 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from University of Florida, Gainesville, in 2007.

In mobile devices, video processing is one of the most energy-hungry tasks, and DRAM image data access energy consumption becomes increasingly dominant in overall video processing system energy consumption. Hence, it is highly desirable to develop domain-specific techniques that can exploit unique image data access characteristics to improve DRAM energy efficiency. Nevertheless, prior efforts on reducing DRAM energy consumption in video processing pale in comparison with that on reducing video processing logic energy consumption. In this work, we first apply three simple yet effective data manipulation techniques that exploit image data spatial/temporal correlation to reduce DRAM image data access energy consumption, then propose a heterogeneous DRAM architecture that can better adapt to unbalanced image access in most video processing to further improve DRAM energy efficiency. DRAM modeling and power estimation have been carried out to evaluate these domain-specific design techniques, and the results show that they can reduce DRAM energy consumption by up to 92%.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2011.2177079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170997","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2011.2177079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/6170997/06086627.pdf","startPage":"303","endPage":"313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing DRAM Image Data Access Energy Consumption in Video Processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Reducing DRAM Image Data Access Energy Consumption in Video Processing","volume":"14","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6086627/","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12615289","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086627/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing DRAM Image Data Access Energy Consumption in Video Processing","sourcePdf":"tmm-li-2177079-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067103S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6170997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6170997","articleId":"6086627","onlineDate":"22 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6086630,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Fadel","affiliation":["Wireless Intelligent Networks Center (WINC), Nile University, Giza, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6146821/6086630/6086630-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Fadel received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt, in 2009.

The relay beamforming matrices are designed in order to minimize the total power transmitted from the relays subject to quality of service constraints on the received signal to interference-plus-noise ratio at each destination node. Due to the nonconvexity of this problem, several approximations have been used in the literature to find a computationally efficient solution.

By using a pair of invertible, linear-conjugate linear time-varying operators called a properizing FREquency SHift (p-FRESH) vectorizer and a p-FRESH scalarizer, it is shown that, whether the complex noise is proper or improper, the SISO channel can always be converted to an equivalent multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) LTI channel whose output is now corrupted by a proper-complex vector wide-sense stationary noise. A variational problem is then formulated in the frequency domain to find the optimal input distribution that maximizes the throughput of the equivalent MIMO channel. It turns out that the optimal input to the SISO channel, obtained through a procedure similar to the water filling, is an SOCS complex Gaussian random process with the same cycle period as the noise. It is shown that this procedure, named cyclic water filling, significantly outperforms ordinary water filling by effectively utilizing the spectral correlation of the cyclostationary noise.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.110711.100414","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6149856/06086676.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.110711.100414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6149856","startPage":"89","endPage":"100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of Second-Order Cyclostationary Complex Gaussian Noise Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6086676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of Second-Order Cyclostationary Complex Gaussian Noise Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086676/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2012","accessionNumber":"12527264","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6086676/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of Second-Order Cyclostationary Complex Gaussian Noise Channels","sourcePdf":"089-tc1201-han.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081474S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6149856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6149856","articleId":"6086676","onlineDate":"23 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6086677,"authors":[{"name":"Jingxian Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6110251/6086677/6086677-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jingxian Wu (S'02-M'06) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China, in 1998, the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Missouri, Columbia, in 2005.

It is influenced by the scheduling algorithm as well as the signal and interference statistics, which, in turn, depend on the propagation characteristics. In this paper we derive analytical expressions for the short-term and long-term channel-averaged spectral efficiencies of the round robin, greedy Max-SINR, and proportional fair schedulers, which are popular and cover a wide range of system performance and fairness trade-offs. A unified spectral efficiency analysis is developed to highlight the differences among these schedulers. The analysis is different from previous work in the literature in the following aspects: (i) it does not assume the co-channel interferers to be identically distributed, as is typical in realistic cellular layouts, (ii) it avoids the loose spectral efficiency bounds used in the literature, which only considered the worst case and best case locations of identical co-channel interferers, (iii) it explicitly includes the effect of multi-tier interferers in the cellular layout and uses a more accurate model for handling the total co-channel interference, and (iv) it captures the impact of using small modulation constellation sizes, which are typical of cellular standards. The analytical results are verified using extensive Monte Carlo simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified Spectral Efficiency Analysis of Cellular Systems with Channel-Aware Schedulers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.110711.100510","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6110251/06086677.pdf","startPage":"3463","endPage":"3474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.110711.100510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6110251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6086677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086677/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","displayDocTitle":"Unified Spectral Efficiency Analysis of Cellular Systems with Channel-Aware Schedulers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6086677/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425640","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified Spectral Efficiency Analysis of Cellular Systems with Channel-Aware Schedulers","sourcePdf":"3463-tc1112-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077435S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6110251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6110251","articleId":"6086677","onlineDate":"23 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6086678,"authors":[{"name":"Cedomir Stefanovic","affiliation":["Department of Power, Electronics and Communication Engineering, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6149856/6086678/6086678-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cedomir Stefanovic received Dipl.-Ing., Mr.-Ing., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia.

The presented analysis is based on descriptors called cross-bifices, which express similarities among sequences in the set. Based on the obtained results, we examine the problem of frame synchronization in synchronous transmission and derive parameters that could be used for the evaluation of the properties of frame-synchronization sequences.

The present technology of electronic backplanes cannot meet the required data-rate demands for next-generation computers, indicating a need for a technology shift from the electronic to the optic domain. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to describe the effect of air turbulence on a short range free space optical communication link, such as would be found in computer backplane communication, and conduct experiments to validate the model. The air turbulence under discussion resembles that which would result from the high temperature of chips on the board together with the ventilation of the air by the chip fan. In our experiment, the communication performance, expressed as bit error rate (BER), is presented as a function of the location of the turbulence source and the log amplitude variance. The log amplitude variance was evaluated by two independent methods. One of the main results of this study is the indication that the performance of the backplane deteriorates even for very small values of air turbulence strength. This is exacerbated by the fact that extremely low BER performance is required at the backplane (e.g., from 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-14</sup>\n to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">- 18</sup>\n ). We also demonstrate that increasing the distance between the turbulence source and the optical link reduces the influence of the air turbulence in an exponential manner. This fact is important for the design of future-generation optical backplanes. It is noted that operation at wavelengths around 1550 nm yields communication performance that is less severely degraded by air turbulence effects than at 670 nm.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2177442","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6094079/06086696.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2177442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6094079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer Backplane With Free Space Optical Links: Air Turbulence Effects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086696/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2012","displayDocTitle":"Computer Backplane With Free Space Optical Links: Air Turbulence Effects","volume":"30","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2012","accessionNumber":"12485045","htmlLink":"/document/6086696/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer Backplane With Free Space Optical Links: Air Turbulence Effects","sourcePdf":"jlt-arnon-2177442-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071624S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6094079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6094079","articleId":"6086696","onlineDate":"23 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6086698,"authors":[{"name":"Fuad E.

The parallel optical transceiver is based on a through-silicon-via silicon carrier as the platform for integration of 24-channel vertical cavity surface-emitting laser and photodiode arrays with CMOS ICs. The Si carrier also includes optical vias (holes) for optical access to conventional surface-emitting 850 nm optoelectronic devices. The 48-channel 3-D transceiver optochips are flip-chip soldered to organic carriers to form transceiver optomodules. Fully functional optomodules with 24 transmitter + 24 receiver channels were assembled and characterized with transmitters operating up to 20 Gb/s/ch and receivers up to 15 Gb/s/ch. At 15 Gb/s, the 48-channel optomodules provide a bidirectional aggregate bandwidth of 360 Gb/s. In addition, o-PCBs have been developed using a 48-channel flex waveguide assembly attached to FR4 electronic boards. Incorporation of waveguide turning mirrors and lens arrays facilitates optical coupling to/from the o-PCB.

This result is accomplished by the use of Nyquist-shaped, polarization-division-multiplexed (PDM) 32-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and both pre- and post-transmission digital equalization. To overcome the limitation of available digital-to-analog converter bandwidth, a novel method is introduced for the generation of the five-subcarriers of the 450 Gb/s signal. Nearly ideal Nyquist pulse-shaping (roll-off factor = 0.01) enables guard bands of only 200 MHz between subcarriers. To mitigate the narrow optical filtering effects from the 50 GHz-grid reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (ROADM), a broadband optical pulse-shaping method has been proposed and demonstrated. By combined use of electrical and optical shaping techniques, transmission of 5 \u00d7 450 Gb/s PDM-Nyquist 32 QAM on the 50 GHz grid over 800 km and one 50 GHz-grid ROADM has been successfully demonstrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6139287/06086700.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"559","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2177243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2177243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139287","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6086700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PDM-Nyquist-32QAM for 450-Gb/s Per-Channel WDM Transmission on the 50 GHz ITU-T Grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical filters","Optical fibers","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical polarization","Optical pumping","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication","optical modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PDM","Nyquist","32QAM","WDM transmission","ITU-T grid optical network","generation and transmission","wavelength division multiplexed","net spectral efficiency","reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexer","bit rate 450 Gbit/s","frequency 50 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectral efficiency","modulation format","coherent","digital","QAM","optical transmission","fiber","capacity","ROADM","optical filtering","pulse shaping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"PDM-Nyquist-32QAM for 450-Gb/s Per-Channel WDM Transmission on the 50 GHz ITU-T Grid","volume":"30","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6086700/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2012","accessionNumber":"12487913","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PDM-Nyquist-32QAM for 450-Gb/s Per-Channel WDM Transmission on the 50 GHz ITU-T Grid","sourcePdf":"jlt-zhou-2177243-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083398S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6139287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6139287","articleId":"6086700","onlineDate":"23 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6086704,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Jin","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6189422/6086704/6086704-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xin Jin (S'09) received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in July 2007, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering from Pennsylvania State University, University Park, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering.","His current research interests include machine learning, signal processing, control systems, energy management, and robotics.","Mr. Jin is a Student Member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the International Society of Automation, and the American Nuclear Society."]},"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Jin","id":"37399134900"},{"name":"Soumalya Sarkar","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6189422/6086704/6086704-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Soumalya Sarkar received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 2010.

To increase data bandwidth while maintaining power transfer efficiency, a multiband telemetry system transmitting power and data using different frequencies has been adopted. However, the power link and data link interact with each other, complicating the operation of both power and data transmission. In this paper, we demonstrate that to achieve high performance data transmission, the cross-coupling between the power coils and data coils have to be taken into consideration. Design equations have been derived and shown that the signal to noise (interference) ratio could be significantly reduced and the resulting data transmission could fail if only the data link coupling is optimized without considering the cross-coupling between the power link and the data link. Design examples have been constructed to demonstrate that there could be more than 30 dB difference in the signal to noise ratio. The analysis has been verified with simulation and measurement results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086736/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12746868","pubMedId":"23853143","volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6086736/","publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Dual Band Power and Data Telemetry for Biomedical Implants","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Dual Band Power and Data Telemetry for Biomedical Implants","sourcePdf":"tbcas-wang-2171958-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076473S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"6204125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"6204125","articleId":"6086736","onlineDate":"23 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":6086737,"authors":[{"name":"Trevor Snow","affiliation":["Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane, Crane, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6097087/6086737/6086737-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Trevor Snow (S'09) received the B.S.E.E degree from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 2003, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","He has been with the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane, Crane, IN, since 2004 as a Microwave Systems Engineer working on various electronic warfare systems.

The interval approach (IA) has, so far, been the only systematic method to construct such models from data intervals that are collected from a survey. However, as pointed out in this paper, it has some limitations, and its performance can be further improved. This paper proposes an enhanced interval approach (EIA) and demonstrates its performance on data that are collected from a web survey. The data part of the EIA has more strict and reasonable tests than the IA, and the fuzzy set part of the EIA has an improved procedure to compute the lower membership function. We also perform a convergence analysis to answer two important questions: 1) Does the output interval type-2 fuzzy set from the EIA converge to a stable model as increasingly more data intervals are collected, and 2) if it converges, then how many data intervals are needed before the resulting interval type-2 fuzzy set is sufficiently similar to the model obtained from infinitely many data intervals? We show that the EIA converges in a mean-square sense, and generally, 30 data intervals seem to be a good compromise between cost and accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6086759/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12761934","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Interval Approach for Encoding Words Into Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets and Its Convergence Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Interval Approach for Encoding Words Into Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets and Its Convergence Analysis","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-wu-2177272-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142478S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6205698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"6205698","articleId":"6086759","onlineDate":"23 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":6086762,"authors":[{"name":"Aravind R.

For this reason, this paper is concerned with developing data-driven models based on the Volterra series for this complex system. Three kinds of different low-order Volterra filters are designed to predict the hot metal silicon content collected from a pint-sized blast furnace, in which a sliding window technique is used to update the filter kernels timely. The predictive results indicate that the linear Volterra predictor can describe the evolvement of the studied silicon sequence effectively with the high percentage of hitting the target, very low root mean square error and satisfactory confidence level about the reliability of the future prediction. These advantages and the low computational complexity reveal that the sliding-window linear Volterra filter is full of potential for multidimensional blast furnace system.

The conventional estimator suffers from a phase ambiguity that reduces to a sign ambiguity for the WL estimator. We derive accurate closed-form expressions for the MSE of the two estimators under four ambiguity resolution scenarios. In the first three scenarios, the receiver resolves the ambiguity using some clairvoyant knowledge about the channel. The first scenario, used as a reference, is the ideal case of optimal resolution. The second scenario assumes that one of the channel coefficients is known and the third assumes knowledge of the coefficient with the largest magnitude. The fourth scenario considers the more realistic case where pilot symbols are employed for ambiguity resolution. Our work demonstrates that there is a strong relationship between the accuracy of ambiguity resolution and the relative performance of WL and conventional subspace-based estimators, showing that the WL estimator performs better when partial or inaccurate channel information is employed for ambiguity resolution.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6146821/06086772.pdf","startPage":"1307","endPage":"1318","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2177261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2177261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Widely Linear versus Conventional Subspace-Based Estimation of SIMO Flat-Fading Channels: Mean Squared Error Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086772/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Widely Linear versus Conventional Subspace-Based Estimation of SIMO Flat-Fading Channels: Mean Squared Error Analysis","htmlLink":"/document/6086772/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12527114","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Widely Linear versus Conventional Subspace-Based Estimation of SIMO Flat-Fading Channels: Mean Squared Error Analysis","sourcePdf":"tsp-psaromiligkos-2177261-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08808S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6146821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6146821","articleId":"6086772","onlineDate":"23 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6086773,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Tang","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Institute, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Tang","id":"37396938400"},{"name":"Jun Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Tang","id":"37290457800"},{"name":"Yingning Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yingning","lastName":"Peng","id":"37279371100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6086773","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1082},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO radar","Vectors","Colored noise","Receivers","Optimized production technology","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","least mean squares methods","matrix algebra","MIMO radar","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveform optimization","MIMO radar waveform design","colored noise","estimation-oriented criteria","multiple-input multiple-output radar","minimum-mean square error","MMSE minimization","normalized-mean square error minimization","NMSE minimization","waveform matrix singular value optimization","singular vector optimization","matching optimality","eigenvectors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","MMSE","NMSE","waveform design"]}],"abstract":"Previous work on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar waveform design in colored noise based on minimizing minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and normalized mean-square error (NMSE) only considered the optimization of the singular value of the waveform matrix, while the optimization of singular vectors, which forms a basis of singular value optimization, was not stressed enough.

The algorithm utilizes a polarized vector-sensor, comprising a spatially collocated six-component electromagnetic vector-sensor, a dipole triad, or a loop triad. This ESPRIT-based algorithm is based on a time-invariant matrix-pencil pair, derived from the time-delayed data-sets collected by a single polarized vector-sensor. The high-order difference-function of the signal's phase constructs the invariant-factor used in the ESPRIT algorithm. The steering vector is estimated from the signal-subspace eigenvector of the data-correlation matrix, following which the closed-form DOA and polarization can be obtained. Given the degree of the polynomial-phase signal, this approach resolves the two-dimensional azimuth-elevation angle and the polarization of the source, and requires neither a priori knowledge of the polynomial-phase signal's coefficients nor a priori knowledge of the polynomial-phase signal's frequency-spectrum. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is verified by Monte Carlo simulations. Estimation accuracies of the DOA and the polarization parameters are evaluated by the closed-form Cram\u00e9r-Rao bounds, which are independent of the polynomial coefficients, the degree of the polynomial-phase signal, and the azimuth-angle of the source.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction of arrival estimation","Polynomials","Electromagnetics","Estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Vectors","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DOA estimation","polynomial-phase signal polarization","single-polarized vector-sensor","direction-of-arrival estimation","arbitrary degree","six-component electromagnetic vector-sensor","high-order difference-function","signal phase construct","ESPRIT algorithm","steering vector","signal-subspace eigenvector","data-correlation matrix","two-dimensional azimuth-elevation angle","source polarization","Monte Carlo simulations","polarization parameters","closed-form Cramer-Rao bounds","polynomial coefficients"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna arrays","array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","FM radar","polarization","polynomial approximation","radar signal processing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2177263","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6146821/06086774.pdf","startPage":"1270","endPage":"1282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2177263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating the DOA and the Polarization of a Polynomial-Phase Signal Using a Single Polarized Vector-Sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6086774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimating the DOA and the Polarization of a Polynomial-Phase Signal Using a Single Polarized Vector-Sensor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086774/","volume":"60","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6086774/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12527116","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating the DOA and the Polarization of a Polynomial-Phase Signal Using a Single Polarized Vector-Sensor","sourcePdf":"tsp-yuan-2177263-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130283S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6146821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6146821","articleId":"6086774","onlineDate":"23 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6086775,"authors":[{"name":"Ayush Bhandari","affiliation":["Biomedical Imaging Group, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6165492/6086775/6086775-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ayush Bhandari was born in 1985.

A special class of the shift-invariant spaces is the class of sampling spaces in which functions are determined by their values on a discrete set of points. One of the vital tools used in the study of sampling spaces is the Zak transform. The Zak transform is also related to the Poisson summation formula and a common thread between all these notions is the Fourier transform. In this paper, we extend some of these notions to the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) domain. First, we introduce two definitions of the discrete fractional Fourier transform and two semi-discrete fractional convolutions associated with them. We employ these definitions to derive necessary and sufficient conditions pertaining to FrFT domain, under which integer shifts of a function form an orthogonal basis or a Riesz basis for a shift-invariant space. We also introduce the fractional Zak transform and derive two different versions of the Poisson summation formula for the FrFT. These extensions are used to obtain new results concerning sampling spaces, to derive the reproducing-kernel for the spaces of fractional band-limited signals, and to obtain a new simple proof of the sampling theorem for signals in that space. Finally, we present an application of our shift-invariant signal model which is linked with the problem of fractional delay filtering.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2177260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6165492/06086775.pdf","startPage":"1627","endPage":"1637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2177260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shift-Invariant and Sampling Spaces Associated With the Fractional Fourier Transform Domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6086775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086775/","displayDocTitle":"Shift-Invariant and Sampling Spaces Associated With the Fractional Fourier Transform Domain","volume":"60","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12590656","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6086775/","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shift-Invariant and Sampling Spaces Associated With the Fractional Fourier Transform Domain","sourcePdf":"tsp-zayed-2177260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144403S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6165492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6165492","articleId":"6086775","onlineDate":"23 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6086786,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Tawfik","affiliation":["Spanish University of Distance Education, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Mohamed Tawfik, PhD Student, Spanish University for distance Education-UNED, mtawfik@ieec.uned.es"]},"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Tawfik","id":"37709473200"},{"name":"Elio Sancristobal","affiliation":["Spanish University of Distance Education, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Elio Sancristobal, Assistant Professor, Spanish University for Distance Education, elio@ieec.uned.es"]},"firstName":"Elio","lastName":"Sancristobal","id":"37400454100"},{"name":"Sergio Mart\u00edn","affiliation":["Spanish University of Distance Education, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Sergio Mart\u00edn Assistant Professor, Spanish University for Distance Education, smartin@ieec.uned.es"]},"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Mart\u00edn","id":"37335755700"},{"name":"Charo Gil","affiliation":["Spanish University of Distance Education, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Charo G\u00edl Assistant Professor, Spanish University for Distance Education, rgil@ieec.uned.es"]},"firstName":"Charo","lastName":"Gil","id":"37544447800"},{"name":"Alberto Pesquera","affiliation":["Spanish University of Distance Education, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Alberto Pesquera, Software Engineer, Spanish University for Distance Education-UNED, apm@innova.uned.es"]},"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Pesquera","id":"37706017100"},{"name":"Pablo Losada","affiliation":["Spanish University of Distance Education, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Pablo Losada, Technical Staff, Spanish University for Distance Education-UNED, plosada@ieec.uned.es"]},"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Losada","id":"37661915700"},{"name":"Gabriel D\u00edaz","affiliation":["Spanish University of Distance Education, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Gabriel D\u00edaz Assistant Professor, Spanish University for Distance Education-UNED, gdiaz@ieec.uned.es"]},"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"D\u00edaz","id":"37425683200"},{"name":"Juan Peire","affiliation":["Spanish University of Distance Education, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Juan Peire, Professor, Spanish University for Distance Education-UNED, jpeire@ieec.uned.es"]},"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Peire","id":"37296197900"},{"name":"Manuel Castro","affiliation":["Spanish University of Distance Education, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Manuel Castro, Professor, Spanish University for Distance Education-UNED, mcastro@ieec.uned.es"]},"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Castro","id":"37289876300"},{"name":"Javier Garc\u00eda-Zubia","affiliation":["Electronics and Automation Department, University of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Javier Garc\u00eda-Zubia is with University of Deusto, Electronics and Automation Department, Avenida de las Universidades 24, 48007 Bilbao (Spain), is with the University of Deusto, he is Head of Dpt.

It leads to a better understanding and allows mastering scientific concepts and theories. The lack of the availability of practical sessions at many universities and institutions owing to the cost and the unavailability of instructors the most of the time caused a significant decline in experimentation in engineering education over the last decades. Recently, with the progress of computer-based learning, remote laboratories have been proven to be the best alternative to the traditional ones, regarding to its low cost and ubiquity. Some universities have already started to deploy remote labs in their practical sessions. This contribution compiles diverse experiences based on the deployment of the remote laboratory, Virtual Instrument Systems in Reality (VISIR), on the practices of undergraduate engineering grades at various universities within the VISIR community. It aims to show the impact of its usage on engineering education concerning the assessments of students and teachers as well.","doi":"10.1109/GOLC.2011.6086786","publicationTitle":"2011 First Global Online Laboratory Consortium Remote Laboratories Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 First Global Online Laboratory Consortium Remote Laboratories Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/6079222/6086777/06086786.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GOLC.2011.6086786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6086777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VISIR deployment in undergraduate engineering practices","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6086786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"VISIR deployment in undergraduate engineering practices","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12390463","htmlLink":"/document/6086786/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","conferenceDate":"12-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VISIR deployment in undergraduate engineering practices","confLoc":"Rapid City, SD, USA","sourcePdf":"Contribution107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143218S","chronDate":"12-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6079222","isNumber":"6086777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6079222","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6086777","articleId":"6086786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6086794,"authors":[{"name":"Iv\u00e1n F.

The model of the environment and the search algorithm are basic issues in the resolution of the problem. This paper highlights the main features of Path Planning proposal for mobile robots in static environments. In our proposal, the path planning is based on Voronoi diagrams, where obstacles in the environment are considered as the generating points of the diagram, and a genetic algorithm is used to find a path without collisions from the robot initial to target position. This work combines some ideas presented by Roque and Doering, who use Voronoi diagrams for modelling the environment, and other ideas presented by Zhang et al. who adopt a genetic algorithm for computing paths on a regular grid based environment, considering certain quality attributes. The main results were probed both in simulated and real environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IX Latin American Robotics Symposium and IEEE Colombian Conference on Automatic Control, 2011

To Compare with parallel current combining method, series voltage combining method using a stacked amplifier architecture can realize a large output voltage swing from the top transistor without exceeding the transistor breakdown voltage limitations. However, at high frequencies, parasitic capacitances at the drain of each transistor become significant and it cause the phase difference between output current and voltage swing which degrades the performance of the power amplifier (PA). To solve this problem, the optimum inter-stage matching technique using inductors is introduced. With proposed optimum inter-stage matching method, the power amplifier performs a gain of 12.2 dB and saturated output power of 17.5 dBm with power added efficiency (PAE) of 20.5%.

Research Questions: Does the initial medium condition impact decision-making quality, creativity, group development, and process satisfaction? Literature Review: Previous literature on media richness (the ability of a medium to carry and reproduce information based on feedback, multiple cues, language variety, and personal focus) and group outcomes (the level of creativity and quality of the work delivered by the group) suggests that ad-hoc groups using asynchronous CMC alone (without any initial meeting) or asynchronous CMC combined with an initial face-to-face (FTF) meeting have significantly higher levels of creativity and decision quality, compared to single-mode synchronous CMC groups or FTF groups. Methodology: In this study, a laboratory experiment was conducted with 136 participants from 14 countries. All teams used asynchronous CMC for two weeks for a software requirements task, following an initial synchronous meeting in one of four conditions: FTF, desktop audioconferencing, desktop videoconferencing, or text only. Results and Discussion: Results suggest that there are no significant differences among the four conditions. This research indicates that it does not matter what medium is used for an initial short meeting of a group that is to subsequently work together via asynchronous text communication.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/47/6087242/06087244.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"391","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication","doi":"10.1109/TPC.2011.2175759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPC.2011.2175759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6087242","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6087244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Does Medium Matter?

This architecture, however, induces radio impairments such as I-Q imbalance and dc offset that may incur severe degradation in communication performance if left uncompensated. In this paper, a new method is proposed to calibrate simultaneously a transceiver's own transmitter and receiver radio impairments with no dedicated analog circuit in the feedback loop. Based on a unified time-domain approach, the proposed method is able to calibrate jointly the frequency-independent I-Q imbalance, frequency-dependent I-Q imbalance and dc offset and is applicable to any type of communication systems (single-carrier, multiple-carrier, etc.). The existing methods in the literature either need a dedicated analog circuit in the feedback loop and/or are applicable only to a particular type of systems with some radio impairments present. The issue of training sequence design is also investigated to optimize the calibration performance, and analytical and simulation results show that the performance loss due to radio impairments can be recovered by the proposed method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.110811.110939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06087248.pdf","startPage":"832","endPage":"841","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.110811.110939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Calibration of Transmitter and Receiver Impairments in Direct-Conversion Radio Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","displayDocTitle":"Joint Calibration of Transmitter and Receiver Impairments in Direct-Conversion Radio Architecture","volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6087248/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537050","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6087248/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Calibration of Transmitter and Receiver Impairments in Direct-Conversion Radio Architecture","sourcePdf":"832-tw1202-hsu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085096S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6087248","onlineDate":"24 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6087249,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Bagheri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6107468/6087249/6087249-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saeed Bagheri (S'10) received his B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran in 2009.

In this paper, RSTBC is applied to two-way relaying wireless networks which, when two terminals want to send a message to each other, can potentially improve the network throughput by allowing them to exchange data over two or three time slots via bidirectional relay communications. Specifically, two decode-and-forward relaying strategies are considered which take up only two time slots. In the first slot the two sources transmit simultaneously. In the former scheme which we refer to as decode and forward both (DFB) RSTBC, only relays which can reliably decode both source blocks via joint maximum likelihood decoding cooperate, and do so by modulating the bit-level XOR of the decoded data through a single RSTBC. In the latter scheme called decode and forward any (DFA) RSTBC, the relays cooperate in the second slot also when they can decode only one of the two source data. In this case each source data that is decoded is mapped into an independent RSTBC. If the relay decoded reliably both sources, after cancellation of the strong interference, then it sends the two RSTBCs encoding the symbol vectors from each of the sources. A randomized forwarding scheme is also proposed for three-time-slot relaying, which is also a DFA strategy, although without joint decoding or interference cancellation after the first slot. The diversity orders achievable through the three proposed schemes are calculated and the obtained theoretical results are validated by means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Interference (signal)","Space time codes","Signal to noise ratio","Doped fiber amplifiers","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","interference suppression","maximum likelihood decoding","Monte Carlo methods","numerical analysis","radio networks","radiofrequency interference","relays","source coding","space-time block codes","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["randomized space-time block coding","RSTBC","decentralized cooperative technique","multiple uncoordinated relay","two-way relaying wireless network","bidirectional relay communication","randomized decode-and-forward relaying strategy","joint maximum likelihood decoding","bit- level XOR modulating","interference cancellation","encoding","symbol vector","randomized forwarding scheme","three-time-slot relaying","Monte Carlo numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decode-and-forward relaying","diversity analysis","interference cancellation","maximum likelihood (ML) detection","space-time randomized coding","two-way cooperation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.110811.102056","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6107468/06087249.pdf","startPage":"4214","endPage":"4225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.110811.102056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomized Decode-and-Forward Strategies for Two-Way Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6087249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Randomized Decode-and-Forward Strategies for Two-Way Relay Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6087249/","volume":"10","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6087249/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12425564","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomized Decode-and-Forward Strategies for Two-Way Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"4214-tw1112-bagheri.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089312S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6107468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6107468","articleId":"6087249","onlineDate":"24 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6087251,"authors":[{"name":"Wenxun Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6135125/6087251/6087251-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenxun Qiu (S'09) received the B.E. and M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2005 and 2008.

The expansion of wireless services and applications in everyday life has necessitated support of higher mobility, as evident from the emerging wireless standards. This results in time-varying fading channels within a transmission frame for which the interference power control schemes and power allocation strategies have not been developed yet. This paper proposes several interference control and power allocation strategies with different criteria for underlay cognitive radios in time-varying frequency-selective fading channels and extend the transmission schemes to multiple secondary systems. The transmission schemes are evaluated in terms of interference statistics at the primary receiver and the ergodic capacity of the secondary user link. Simulation results over the wide Doppler range show how the proposed schemes with different criteria shape the interference at the primary receiver and the capacity of the secondary user. The results also illustrate better interference control capability of the proposed approaches over the existing scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6087251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12487453","htmlLink":"/document/6087251/","displayDocTitle":"Interference-Controlled Transmission Schemes for Cognitive Radio in Frequency-Selective Time-Varying Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference-Controlled Transmission Schemes for Cognitive Radio in Frequency-Selective Time-Varying Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"142-tw1201-qiu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107976S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6135125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6135125","articleId":"6087251","onlineDate":"24 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6087252,"authors":[{"name":"Behrooz Makki","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6135125/6087252/6087252-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Behrooz Makki was born in Tehran, Iran.

Considering quasi-static fading environments, this paper studies the effect of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) feedback on the average rate of unlicensed spectrum sharing channels. The results are obtained for different scenarios; Under both peak and average secondary user transmission power constraints, the channel average rate is determined under primary user limited received interference power conditions when there is perfect information about the interference available at the secondary user transmitter. An approximate solution for power allocation between incremental redundancy (INR) HARQ-based data retransmissions is proposed which can be applied in single-user networks as well. Then, we investigate the effect of imperfect secondary-primary channel state information on the interference-limited average rate of the secondary channel. Finally, we restudy all mentioned scenarios in the case where the data transmission is constrained to have limited outage probability. Substantial performance improvement is observed with even a single HARQ-based retransmission in all simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.110811.101700","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6135125/06087252.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.110811.101700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6135125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Average Rate of HARQ-Based Quasi-Static Spectrum Sharing Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6087252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6087252/","displayDocTitle":"On the Average Rate of HARQ-Based Quasi-Static Spectrum Sharing Networks","volume":"11","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2012","accessionNumber":"12487454","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6087252/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Average Rate of HARQ-Based Quasi-Static Spectrum Sharing Networks","sourcePdf":"065-tw1201-makki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086682S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6135125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6135125","articleId":"6087252","onlineDate":"24 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6087253,"authors":[{"name":"A.

By considering these channel estimation errors, an optimal power allocation policy for each SU transmitter is derived to achieve a lower-bound of the ergodic sum capacity of opportunistic spectrum sharing MAC, subject to a set of SUs transmit power constraints and a set of interference power constraints at each PU receiver. Furthermore, convex optimization techniques are exploited to derive an efficient algorithm to obtain the optimal power allocation for each SU transmitter.

Despite the many obstacles, clinical trials for electronic approaches are in progress and already demonstrating some success. Optogenetic/optoelectronic retinal prosthesis may prove to have even greater capabilities. Although resolutions are now moving beyond recognition of simple shapes, it will nevertheless be poor compared to normal vision. If we define the aim to be to return mobility and natural scene recognition to the patient, it is important to maximize the useful visual information we attempt to transfer. In this paper, we highlight a method to simplify the scene, perform spatial image compression, and then apply spike coding. We then show the potential for translation on standard consumer processors. The algorithms are applicable to all forms of visual prosthesis, but we particularly focus on optogenetic approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2011.2177498","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6477135/06087275.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2011.2177498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6477135","startPage":"781","endPage":"791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Processing Platform for Optoelectronic/Optogenetic Retinal Prosthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6087275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Processing Platform for Optoelectronic/Optogenetic Retinal Prosthesis","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6087275/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13382338","pubMedId":"22127992","dateOfInsertion":"11 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6087275/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Processing Platform for Optoelectronic/Optogenetic Retinal Prosthesis","sourcePdf":"tbme-alatabany-2177498-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112247S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6477135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6477135","articleId":"6087275","onlineDate":"24 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6087281,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Debes","affiliation":["AGT Group (Research and Development) GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6186874/6087281/6087281-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Debes (M'11) received the M.Sc. and Dr.-Ing. degrees in electrical engineering from Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany, in 2006 and 2010, respectively.","He worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Signal Processing Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt.

Two generalized statistical detectors are proposed which perform joint detection and fusion of a set of multipolarization radar images. The first detector is an extension of a previously proposed iterative target detector for multiview TWRI. This extension allows the detector to automatically adapt to statistics that may vary, depending on target locations and electromagnetic-wave polarizations. The second detector is based on Bayes' test and is of interest when target pixel occupancies are known from, e.g., secondary data. Properties of the proposed detectors are delineated and demonstrated by real data measurements using wideband sum-and-delay beamforming, acquired in a semicontrolled lab environment. We examine the performance of the proposed detectors when imaging both metal objects and humans.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2170077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6186874","startPage":"1968","endPage":"1979","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6186874/06087281.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Detection Using Target Polarization Signatures in Through-the-Wall Radar Imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6087281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6087281/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Detection Using Target Polarization Signatures in Through-the-Wall Radar Imaging","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12691974","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"50","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Detection Using Target Polarization Signatures in Through-the-Wall Radar Imaging","sourcePdf":"tgrs-debes-2170077-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069672S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6186874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6186874","articleId":"6087281","onlineDate":"24 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6087291,"authors":[{"name":"Manav R.

Existing ML and PL decoders of the differentially modulated uncoded data in the DF-based cooperative communication system are only applicable to binary modulated signals like binary phase shift keying and binary frequency shift keying, whereas the proposed decoders are applicable to complex-valued unitary and nonunitary constellations suitable for differential modulation under uncoded transmissions. We derive a closed-form expression of the uncoded average symbol error rate (SER) of the proposed PL decoder with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n phase-shift keying constellation in a cooperative communication system with a single relay and one source-destination pair. An approximate average SER by ignoring higher order noise terms is also derived for this setup. It is analytically shown on the basis of the derived approximate SER that the proposed PL decoder provides full diversity of second order. In addition, we also derive the approximate SER of the differential DF system with multiple relays at asymptotically high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the source-relay links. It is shown by simulations that the proposed PL decoder in the differential DF cooperative system with more than one relay also achieves the maximum possible diversity.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2177482","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6129945/06087291.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2177482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decode-and-Forward-Based Differential Modulation for Cooperative Communication System With Unitary and Nonunitary Constellations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6087291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6087291/","displayDocTitle":"Decode-and-Forward-Based Differential Modulation for Cooperative Communication System With Unitary and Nonunitary Constellations","volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471802","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decode-and-Forward-Based Differential Modulation for Cooperative Communication System With Unitary and Nonunitary Constellations","sourcePdf":"tvt-bhatnagar-2177482-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059023S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","isNumber":"6129945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"54","articleId":"6087291","onlineDate":"24 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6087292,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Long Chin","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6129945/6087292/6087292-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wen-Long Chin received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1994, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2008.","In February 2009, he joined National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, as an Assistant Professor.

In this paper, the energy management control problem for a series plug-in PEMFC/Li-ion battery hybrid midsize sedan is formulated and investigated using a two-stage controller (TSC). The control objective is to minimize hydrogen consumption and simultaneously protect PEMFC health. The proposed TSC consists of two controllers designed in two stages with different control functions. During the first design stage, a predictive controller is developed using the telemetry equivalent consumption minimization strategy (T-ECMS) approach to predict the global battery state-of-charge (SOC) optimality trend and local control reference, without regard for the PEMFC health constraints. During the second stage of design, a tracking controller is designed to track the local control reference with respect to the PEMFC health constraints and other physical limitations at the current control step, which ensures that the system follows the optimal battery SOC reference over a long time horizon. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed TSC is compared with the T-ECMS and an electric vehicle controller (EVC) under the Matlab/Simulink software environment. The results demonstrate that the TSC achieves a reasonable tradeoff between hydrogen fuel consumption and PEMFC health protection.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2177483","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"498","endPage":"508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2177483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151237","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6151237/06087294.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","System-on-a-chip","Vehicles","Energy management","Fuel cells","Vehicle dynamics","Mechanical power transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","energy consumption","energy management systems","fuel cell vehicles","hybrid electric vehicles","predictive control","proton exchange membrane fuel cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-stage energy management control","fuel cell plug-in hybrid electric vehicles","fuel cell longevity","proton exchange membrane fuel cell","PEMFC","two-stage controller","TSC","hydrogen consumption","predictive controller","T-ECMS","global battery state-of-charge","SOC","electric vehicle controller","tracking controller","current control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy management control","equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS)","fuel cell health","plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Two-Stage Energy Management Control of Fuel Cell Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles Considering Fuel Cell Longevity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6087294/","volume":"61","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6087294/","accessionNumber":"12527171","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Stage Energy Management Control of Fuel Cell Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles Considering Fuel Cell Longevity","sourcePdf":"tvt-sun-2177483-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093373S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6151237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6151237","articleId":"6087294","onlineDate":"24 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":6087302,"authors":[{"name":"Luca G.

Various PUF implementation techniques have been proposed to translate chip-specific variations into a unique binary string. It is difficult to maintain repeatability of chip ID generation, especially over a wide range of operating conditions. To address this problem, we propose utilizing configurable ring oscillators and an orthogonal re-initialization scheme to improve repeatability.

A cooperative transmission, in which the destination may overhear all transmission attempts, benefits from incremental redundancy techniques, achieving a higher throughput and reducing the packet delay and the outage probability. This paper presents a theoretical framework to assess the limiting performance of efficient coding techniques in Decode-and-Forward cooperative scenarios. In this paper it is shown that suitable designed codes, such as punctured turbo codes, approach the limiting performance in all the studied scenarios. The paper also addresses the design of punctured turbo code schemes capable of performing close to the presented limiting bound. A novel Genetic Algorithm (GA) is introduced for designing incremental puncturing schemes suited to cooperative transmissions. The algorithm uses a recently proposed tri-dimensional (3D) EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart technique to model the decoding behavior of parallel concatenations of non-systematic periodically punctured convolutional codes. It is shown that the design algorithm allows contriving capacity approaching codes for the source and the relay. The paper further shows that the GA aided designed codes closely approach the theoretical results, outperforming previously proposed systematic incremental and complementary schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6135125/06087379.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.110811.110220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.110811.110220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6135125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6087379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Coding Schemes: Design and Performance Evaluation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Genetic algorithms","Signal to noise ratio","Relays","Turbo codes","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","convolutional codes","cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","genetic algorithms","network coding","packet radio networks","probability","source coding","turbo codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative coding scheme","communication channel","cooperative transmission","incremental redundancy technique","packet delay","outage probability","decode-and-forward cooperative scenario","punctured turbo code","genetic algorithm","incremental puncturing scheme","tri-dimensional extrinsic information transfer chart technique","parallel concatenation","nonsystematic periodically punctured convolutional code","source code","GA aided designed code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel coding","cooperation","sphere-packing bound","EXIT charts","genetic algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6087379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Coding Schemes: Design and Performance Evaluation","volume":"11","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6087379/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2012","accessionNumber":"12487456","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Coding Schemes: Design and Performance Evaluation","sourcePdf":"222-tw1201-babich.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086759S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6135125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6135125","articleId":"6087379","onlineDate":"28 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6087381,"authors":[{"name":"Moslem Noori","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineer, University of Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Moslem","lastName":"Noori","id":"37703264400"},{"name":"Masoud Ardakani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineer, University of Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Ardakani","id":"37272335000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"6087381","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1132},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6087381","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Bit error rate","Phase shift keying","Power control","Synchronization","Labeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","decode and forward communication","error statistics","Gray codes","network coding","phase shift keying","relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbol mapping","binary physical layer network coding","PSK modulation","superimposed constellation","received signal","bit mapping","phase shift keying modulation","BER performance","binary reflected Gray mapping","semiGray mapping condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical-layer network coding","PSK modulation","symbol mapping","minimum Euclidean distance"]}],"abstract":"In a system employing physical-layer network coding, the superimposed constellation at the relay may have ambiguity where one received signal is associated with more than one possible combination of users' data.

The Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Code (QOSTBC), due to its advantages in the transmission rate and the decoding complexity, is an important transmit diversity scheme for more than 2 transmit antennas. In this paper, we investigate the performance of QOSTBC for dual-polarized MIMO channels. We show that when QOSTBC is used with dual-polarized antennas, we need to connect the power amplifiers (PAs) to the differently polarized antennas carefully, in order to avoid more than 1dB performance loss at high cross-polar discrimination (XPD). Also, we show that, if the QOSTBC with constellation rotations, which achieves full diversity in uni-polarized MIMO channels, is used, the performance loss due to the bad PA-to-antenna connections is mitigated. However, when the XPD is high, the QOSTBC without full diversity, if connected properly, can achieve better performance than the QOSTBC with full diversity when connected badly, which shows the importance of a proper connection at high XPD. So, to guarantee robust performance of QOSTBC at any XPD, besides designing codes to have full diversity and good diversity product, connecting the PAs and the antennas properly is also important.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.110811.111061","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6135125/06087382.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.110811.111061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6135125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes for Dual-Polarized MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6087382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6087382/","displayDocTitle":"On Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes for Dual-Polarized MIMO Channels","volume":"11","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2012","accessionNumber":"12503820","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6087382/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes for Dual-Polarized MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"397-tw1201-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083615S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6135125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6135125","articleId":"6087382","onlineDate":"28 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6087383,"authors":[{"name":"Daojing He","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Daojing","lastName":"He","id":"37590740100"},{"name":"Chun Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280741000"},{"name":"Sammy Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Sammy","lastName":"Chan","id":"37281291000"},{"name":"Jiajun Bu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Jiajun","lastName":"Bu","id":"37275132600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"6087383","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":136,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2665},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Manganese","Protocols","Computer crime","Privacy","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic protocols","mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handover authentication","bilinear pairing functions","seamless handover","multiple access points","security attacks","PairHand protocol","pairing-based cryptography","batch signature verification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless networks","security","privacy","efficiency","handover authentication"]}],"abstract":"Seamless handover over multiple access points is highly desirable to mobile nodes, but ensuring security and efficiency of this process is challenging.

However, the location errors can be very large due to the fact that some of the measurements are from non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths. In this paper, a semi-definite programming (SDP) based node localization algorithm in NLOS environments is proposed for ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless sensor networks. The positions of sensors can be estimated using the distance estimates from location-aware anchors as well as other sensors. However, in the absence of line-of-sight (LOS) paths, e.g., in indoor networks, the NLOS range estimates can be significantly biased. As a result, the NLOS error can remarkably decrease the location accuracy, and it is not easy to accurately distinguish LOS from NLOS measurements. According to the information known about the prior probabilities and distributions of the NLOS errors, three different cases are introduced and the respective localization problems are addressed. Simulation results demonstrate that this algorithm achieves high location accuracy even for the case in which NLOS and LOS measurements are not identifiable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6087384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6087384/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","publicationDate":"January 2012","accessionNumber":"12487460","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Non-Line-of-Sight Node Localization Based on Semi-Definite Programming in Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Line-of-Sight Node Localization Based on Semi-Definite Programming in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"108-tw1201-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081026S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6135125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"6135125","articleId":"6087384","onlineDate":"28 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6087385,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6135125/6087385/6087385-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Li (S'10) received his B.S. and M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

To simultaneously achieve these goals, a two-step (hybrid) scheduling method is proposed that pre-selects a set of secondary users based on their interference on the primary, and from among them selects the user(s) that yield the highest secondary throughput. The optimal number of active secondary transmitters is characterized as a function of the primary interference constraint, the secondary transmit power, and the number of secondary transmitters n. The secondary sum-rate (throughput) of the proposed algorithm grows optimally (proportional to log n). We investigate the tradeoff between scaling the secondary throughput and reducing interference on the primary, and characterize the optimum tradeoff in the regime of large n. Finally, we study user scheduling under fairness constraints, which is necessary when the channel statistics of secondary nodes are not identical. A modified hybrid scheduling rule is proposed to ensure user fairness, while still achieving the optimal growth rate for the secondary throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6087385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12487461","htmlLink":"/document/6087385/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Opportunistic Scheduling in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Opportunistic Scheduling in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"328-tw1201-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073153S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6135125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6135125","articleId":"6087385","onlineDate":"28 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6087998,"authors":[{"name":"K.

We assume that the data within each hyperspectral data class lies in a very low-dimensional subspace. Unlike traditional supervised methods, the proposed method does not have separate training and testing phases and, therefore, does not need a training procedure for model creation. Further, to prove the sparsity of hyperspectral data and handle the computational intensiveness and time demand of general-purpose linear programming (LP) solvers, we propose a Homotopy-based sparse classification approach, which works efficiently when data is highly sparse. The approach is not only time efficient, but it also produces results, which are comparable to the traditional methods. The proposed approaches are tested for our difficult classification problem of hyperspectral data with few labeled samples. Extensive experiments on four real hyperspectral data sets prove that hyperspectral data is highly sparse in nature, and the proposed approaches are robust across different databases, offer more classification accuracy, and are more efficient than state-of-the-art methods.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2172617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6200913","startPage":"2287","endPage":"2302","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6200913/06088007.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast and Robust Sparse Approach for Hyperspectral Data Classification Using a Few Labeled Samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6088007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6088007/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Fast and Robust Sparse Approach for Hyperspectral Data Classification Using a Few Labeled Samples","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12728352","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"50","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast and Robust Sparse Approach for Hyperspectral Data Classification Using a Few Labeled Samples","sourcePdf":"tgrs-ulhaq-2172617-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13208S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6200913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"6200913","articleId":"6088007","onlineDate":"28 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6088009,"authors":[{"name":"Sonia Dhia","affiliation":["INSA Toulouse, Toulouse, Occitanie, FR"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6145766/6088009/6088009-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sonia Ben Dhia (M'06) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronic design from the Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es (INSA), Toulouse, France, in 1995 and 1998, respectively.","She is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, INSA.

The in-loop filters are derived from an optimization perspective, and an analytical method to design the controlling parameters of a PLL with in-loop filters is also presented. Such filters can also be selected as conventional window functions in which case they can be tuned to reject certain frequency components similar to the discrete Fourier transform. In this paper, a rigorous method to introduce the concept of in-loop filters and window functions into PLL systems is presented. This method enables smoother estimation of the signal parameters such as phase angle, frequency, and amplitude in the presence of noise and harmonics.

The approach uses exponential smoothing to preprocess traffic flow data by removing the lumpiness from collected traffic flow data, before employing a variant of the LM algorithm to train the NN weights of an NN model. This approach aids NN training, as the preprocessed traffic flow data are more smooth and continuous than the original unprocessed traffic flow data. The proposed method was evaluated by forecasting short-term traffic flow conditions on the Mitchell freeway in Western Australia. With regard to the generalization capabilities for short-term traffic flow forecasting, the NN models developed using the proposed approach outperform those that are developed based on the alternative tested algorithms, which are particularly designed either for short-term traffic flow forecasting or for enhancing generalization capabilities of NNs.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2011.2174051","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/6205705/06088012.pdf","startPage":"644","endPage":"654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2011.2174051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6205705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-Network-Based Models for Short-Term Traffic Flow Forecasting Using a Hybrid Exponential Smoothing and Levenberg\u2013Marquardt Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6088012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6088012/","displayDocTitle":"Neural-Network-Based Models for Short-Term Traffic Flow Forecasting Using a Hybrid Exponential Smoothing and Levenberg\u2013Marquardt Algorithm","volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12761748","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6088012/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-Network-Based Models for Short-Term Traffic Flow Forecasting Using a Hybrid Exponential Smoothing and Levenberg\u2013Marquardt Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tits-chan-2174051-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125862S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6205705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"254","xplore-issue":"6205705","articleId":"6088012","onlineDate":"28 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":6088013,"authors":[{"name":"Huaguang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Synthetic Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6099846/6088013/6088013-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huaguang Zhang (SM'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in control engineering from the Northeast Dianli University of China, Jilin, China, in 1982 and 1985, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in thermal power engineering and automation from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1991.","He joined the Department of Automatic Control, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1992, as a Post-Doctoral Fellow for two years.

A new membership function for classifying the neuron of DCFMN is defined in which the noise, the geometric center of the hyperbox, and the data core are considered. Instead of using the contraction process of the FMNN described by Simpson, a kind of overlapped neuron with new membership function based on the data core is proposed and added to neural network to represent the overlapping area of hyperboxes belonging to different classes. Furthermore, some algorithms of online learning and classification are presented according to the structure of DCFMN. DCFMN has strong robustness and high accuracy in classification taking onto account the effect of data core and noise. The performance of DCFMN is checked by some benchmark datasets and compared with some traditional fuzzy neural networks, such as the fuzzy min-max neural network (FMNN), the general FMNN, and the FMNN with compensatory neuron. Finally the pattern classification of a pipeline is evaluated using DCFMN and other classifiers.

With the increasing number of services available within an enterprise and over the internet, locating a service online may not be appropriate from the performance perspective, especially in large internet-based service repositories. Instead, services usually need to be clustered offline according to their similarity. Thereafter, services in one or several clusters are necessary to be examined online during dynamic service discovery. In this paper we propose to cluster data providing (DP) services using a refined fuzzy C-means algorithm. We consider the composite relation between DP service elements (i.e., input, output, and semantic relation between them) when representing DP services in terms of vectors. A DP service vector is assigned to one or multiple clusters with certain degrees. When grouping similar services into one cluster, while partitioning different services into different clusters, the capability of service search engine is improved significantly.","doi":"10.1109/SKG.2011.9","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Semantics, Knowledge and Grids","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Semantics, Knowledge and Grids","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088022/6088078/06088125.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SKG.2011.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6088078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering and Managing Data Providing Services Using Machine Learning Technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6088125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Clustering and Managing Data Providing Services Using Machine Learning Technique","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406947","htmlLink":"/document/6088125/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering and Managing Data Providing Services Using Machine Learning Technique","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4515a225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1042S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088022","isNumber":"6088078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088022","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6088078","articleId":"6088125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6088177,"authors":[{"name":"Jacek Kopeck\u00fd","affiliation":["Knowledge Media Institute, Open University, UK"],"firstName":"Jacek","lastName":"Kopeck\u00fd","id":"37664902100"},{"name":"Carlos Pedrinaci","affiliation":["Knowledge Media Institute, Open University, UK"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Pedrinaci","id":"37545465000"},{"name":"Alistair Duke","affiliation":["Research and Technology, BT Innovate and Design, UK"],"firstName":"Alistair","lastName":"Duke","id":"37429546200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1127-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1125-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1126-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6088177","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource description framework","Databases","Web services","Concrete","Vocabulary","Security","Next generation networking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","hypermedia","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["restful write-oriented API","RDF knowledge bases","linked data movement","open RDF data","World Wide Web","configurable approach","linked data writing","linked data updating","hypertext","hyperlinking","resource description","update-enabled hyperdata"]}],"abstract":"The Linked Data movement has been very successful in bringing large amounts of open RDF data on the Web.

The main analysis is carried out on the excitation sector of the GTEM chamber - APEX. The basic metamaterial cell pattern employed here consists of a ring resonator - RR or CLL (Capacitively Loaded Loop) in SRR - Split Ring Resonator and CSRR - Complementary Split Ring Resonator configuration topologies. Experimental results are compared to simulated ones and show the tuning characteristic advantages of the patterned septum in comparison to the conventional -passive- type. Also, to avoid reflections, the match between the connector and the center conductor should be carefully designed. This technique appears as an option to optimize GTEM chambers overcoming its size limitation and improving its overall performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6088242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6088242/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12405300","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Metamaterial patterning to improve the septum of a GTEM chamber performance: RR - ring resonator cells stamped and tested on the APEX","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metamaterial patterning to improve the septum of a GTEM chamber performance: RR - ring resonator cells stamped and tested on the APEX","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"a23dearaujo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036696S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6082468","isNumber":"6088236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082468","xplore-issue":"6088236","articleId":"6088242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6088291,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamad Faizal Abd Rahman","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Nibong Tebal, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohamad Faizal Abd","lastName":"Rahman","id":"38239867000"},{"name":"Mohd Rizal Arshad","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Nibong Tebal, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Rizal","lastName":"Arshad","id":"37272134100"},{"name":"Asrulnizam Abd Manaf","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Nibong Tebal, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Asrulnizam Abd","lastName":"Manaf","id":"37604917000"},{"name":"Mohd Ikhwan Hadi Yaacob","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Nibong Tebal, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Ikhwan Hadi","lastName":"Yaacob","id":"38227986200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-846-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-844-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-845-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6088291","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Materials","Acoustics","Sensitivity","Resonant frequency","Damping","Microfluidics","Microchannel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic transducers","damping","electrolytes","harmonic analysis","membranes","microfluidics","polymers","sensitivity","silicon compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidic based acoustic sensor","key structure materials","membrane acoustic response","damping effect","electrolyte material","Teflon","polydimethylsiloxane","PDMS","acoustic pressure signal","deflection sensitivity","carbonate electrolyte","harmonic analysis","Si3N4"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["acoustic sensor","microfludic","membrane"]}],"abstract":"This paper reports the initial investigation on a novel acoustic sensor design based on micro fluidic technology. The report includes the proposed design structure and the simulation of key structure materials that affect the performance of such sensor.

In damping analysis, Propylene Carbonate electrolyte was used as a backing layer that filled the cavity gap. With the PDMS was selected as the membrane structure, harmonic analysis was performed to investigate the damping effect caused by electrolyte material on resonance frequency and deflection sensitivity. Result showed that with the proposed design structure and electrolyte backing layer, the harmonic frequency was shifted to a lower value with the maximum deflection was reduced by about 50%. The result also suggests the needs for selecting the right gap material for micro fluidic application that can compromise the damping and the response of the membrane.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling of a novel design of microfluidic based acoustic sensor","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Regional Symposium on Micro and Nano Electronics","doi":"10.1109/RSM.2011.6088291","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Regional Symposium on Micro and Nano Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6086117/6088265/06088291.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RSM.2011.6088291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6088265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6088291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6088291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Modelling of a novel design of microfluidic based acoustic sensor","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6088291/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406699","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling of a novel design of microfluidic based acoustic sensor","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"141569458039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052218S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6086117","isNumber":"6088265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6086117","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6088265","articleId":"6088291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6088303,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Compressed sampling is a paradigm which exploits sparsity, a feature common to several signals of interest, to allow the design of efficient data acquisition schemes. These need to be followed by more complex signal processing algorithms for accurate signal reconstruction. The discussion focuses on the application of a CS algorithm to spectrum sensing and modulation analysis in wireless communications. When the signals of interest occupy only a few among several possible bands, and do so only for short time bursts, feeding a vector signal analyser with the required preliminary information becomes increasingly important, but also more challenging. Results presented in the paper show that a CS algorithm can successfully extract such information from a record of signal samples, providing spectrum-blind sensing capabilities.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Workshop on Measurements and Networking Proceedings (M&N)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6083233/6088475/06088483.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"41","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Workshop on Measurements and Networking Proceedings (M&N)","doi":"10.1109/IWMN.2011.6088483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWMN.2011.6088483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6088475","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6088483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sensing and vector signal analysis preprocessing based on compressed sampling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Sensors","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation","radiocommunication","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing","vector signal analysis","compressed sampling","signal analysis preprocessor","vector measurements","digital modulation","data acquisition","signal processing algorithm","signal reconstruction","modulation analysis","wireless communications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vector signal analysis","compressed sampling","spectrum sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6088483/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sensing and vector signal analysis preprocessing based on compressed sampling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6088483/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406261","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"10-11 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sensing and vector signal analysis preprocessing based on compressed sampling","confLoc":"Anacapri, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569465947.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067215S","chronDate":"10-11 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6083233","isNumber":"6088475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6083233","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6088475","articleId":"6088483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6088492,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Pivato","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science (DISI), University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Pivato","id":"37680567800"},{"name":"Stefano Dalpez","affiliation":["Centre for Materials and Microsystems (CMM IRST) Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Dalpez","id":"38519602800"},{"name":"David Macii","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science (DISI), University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Macii","id":"37273997500"},{"name":"Dario Petri","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science (DISI), University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Dario","lastName":"Petri","id":"37273676000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0457-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0455-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0456-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6088492","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":411},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Batteries","Accelerometers","Current measurement","Wireless communication","Biomedical monitoring","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body sensor networks","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wearable wireless sensor node","body fall detection","ambient assisted living","smart home services","TelosB","software compatibility","TinyOS","chip antenna","compact high-capacity lithium-ion polymer rechargeable battery","Tmote Sky"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks (WSN)","sensor node architecture","low-power","ambient assisted living"]}],"abstract":"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are commonly considered as a key enabling technology for ambient assisted living (AAL) and smart home services.

To overcome the high energy and long latency associated with write operations of NVMs, a small SRAM is typically incorporated into the hybrid cache for accommodating write-intensive cache blocks. How to efficiently manage this SRAM and manipulate the write operations are crucial to the performance of the hybrid cache. In this paper, we first present our observation that the intensity of write operations on different cache sets is usually non-uniform for real applications, such as multimedia, multi-programmed, multithreaded applications. The previously proposed hybrid cache schemes can not efficiently and symmetrically utilize the small SRAM to accommodate such widely-existing non-uniform writes on cache sets. Based on this observation, we propose a novel hybrid cache design, Dual Associative Hybrid Cache (denoted as DAHYC), as well as the corresponding cache management policy. By organizing the SRAM blocks in the hybrid cache as a semi-independent set-associative cache, several hybrid cache sets can efficiently share and cooperatively utilize their SRAM blocks, instead of exclusively utilizing the SRAM blocks in each cache set in previous hybrid cache schemes, to boost power-efficiency. Through prudently manipulating the locality information of SRAM blocks in both the NVM sets and the SRAM sets, the proposed cache management policy also delivers high-performance. Experimental results show that, compared with previous works, the DAHYC can reduce the dynamic power of the hybrid cache by 24.8% on average and up to 54% for SPEC2000 INT benchmarks, while at the same time improving the performance of the hybrid cache by 1.16% on average.","doi":"10.1109/ESTIMedia.2011.6088521","publicationTitle":"2011 9th IEEE Symposium on Embedded Systems for Real-Time Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 9th IEEE Symposium on Embedded Systems for Real-Time Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6081984/6088514/06088521.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTIMedia.2011.6088521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6088514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting set-level write non-uniformity for energy-efficient NVM-based hybrid cache","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6088521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting set-level write non-uniformity for energy-efficient NVM-based hybrid cache","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12407656","htmlLink":"/document/6088521/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"13-14 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting set-level write non-uniformity for energy-efficient NVM-based hybrid cache","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085775S","chronDate":"13-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081984","isNumber":"6088514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081984","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6088514","articleId":"6088521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6088576,"authors":[{"name":"Raymond R.

This discussion will overview various definitions of dexterity used in the literature and highlight issues related to specific metrics and quantitative analysis. It will also present arguments regarding why hand dexterity is desirable or necessary, particularly in contrast to the capabilities of a kinematically redundant arm with a simple grasper. Finally, we overview and illustrate the various classes of in-hand manipulation, and review a number of dexterous manipulators that have been previously developed. We believe this work will help to revitalize the dialogue on dexterity in the manipulation community and lead to further formalization of the concepts discussed here.","doi":"10.1109/ICAR.2011.6088576","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 15th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6081304/6088536/06088576.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 15th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAR.2011.6088576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6088536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On dexterity and dexterous manipulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulators","Thumb","Kinematics","Grippers","Grasping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dexterous manipulators","manipulator kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dexterous manipulation community","robotic system","robotics community","in-hand manipulation capability","formal description","control complexity","quantitative analysis","hand dexterity","kinematically redundant arm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6088576/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"On dexterity and dexterous manipulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6088576/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12406588","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On dexterity and dexterous manipulation","confLoc":"Tallinn, Estonia","sourcePdf":"0065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070473S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081304","isNumber":"6088536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081304","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6088536","articleId":"6088576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":6088657,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Zhao","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark","Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37403487700"},{"name":"Xiaodan Pang","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Xiaodan","lastName":"Pang","id":"38018791200"},{"name":"Lei Deng","affiliation":["School of Optoelectronics Science & Engineering, HuaZhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, China","DTU Fotonik, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Deng","id":"37709295900"},{"name":"Maisara B.

transmission technologies, RoF-DAS over WDM-PON has been proposed. In this system, WDM is used to multiplex RoF links for many BSs and uses optical TDM to multiplex antenna at a BS and heterogeneous wireless services. The system can transparently transport various types of wireless services to BSs and provide the flexibility for non-uniform traffic distribution and user mobility. This paper experimentally demonstrates MIMO RF signals transmission in the system, theoretically investigates optical beat noise that arises during the process of optical TDM and proposes a method for its reduction.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics jointly held with the 2011 Asia-Pacific Microwave Photonics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6083218/6088649/06088660.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"28","publicationTitle":"2011 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics jointly held with the 2011 Asia-Pacific Microwave Photonics Conference","doi":"10.1109/MWP.2011.6088660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWP.2011.6088660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6088649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6088660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental demonstration of MIMO RF signal transmission in RoF-DAS over WDM-PON","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["RF signals","Passive optical networks","Optical pulses","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical fibers","MIMO","Optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband antennas","MIMO communication","optical noise","passive optical networks","radio-over-fibre","telecommunication traffic","time division multiplexing","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO RF signal transmission","RoF-DAS technology","WDM-PON","ubiquitous antenna system","broadband optical transmission technology","RoF links","optical TDM","multiplex antenna","heterogeneous wireless services","nonuniform traffic distribution","user mobility","optical beat noise","distributed antenna system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","RoF","DAS","OTDM","WDM-PON","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6088660/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Experimental demonstration of MIMO RF signal transmission in RoF-DAS over WDM-PON","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6088660/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406142","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental demonstration of MIMO RF signal transmission in RoF-DAS over WDM-PON","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"0072122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057496S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6083218","isNumber":"6088649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6083218","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6088649","articleId":"6088660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6088665,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia","Victoria Research Laboratory (NICTA-VRL), National ICT Australia Limited, Australia"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Wang","id":"37653875500"},{"name":"Ampalavanapillai Nirmalathas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia","Victoria Research Laboratory (NICTA-VRL), National ICT Australia Limited, Australia"],"firstName":"Ampalavanapillai","lastName":"Nirmalathas","id":"37270057800"},{"name":"Christina Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Christina","lastName":"Lim","id":"37279826900"},{"name":"Efstratios Skafidas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia","Victoria Research Laboratory (NICTA-VRL), National ICT Australia Limited, Australia"],"firstName":"Efstratios","lastName":"Skafidas","id":"37370047000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-718-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-716-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-717-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6088665","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":341},"abstract":"In this paper we experimentally investigate a high-speed full-duplex indoor optical wireless communication system incorporating subcarrier multiplexing to accommodate for multiple users.

Moreover, the downstream traffic wavelength is reused for the upstream traffic signal by using re-modulation technology.

The sampling approach that has been used was based on a photoconductive switch made from low-temperature grown GaAs. The Photonic sampler may be used to down sample RF signals to base band before further conversion in digital by an electronic ADC. Thanks to this approach, the usual frequency mixers used for down-conversion are suppressed and replaced by the Photonic sampler. This very simple approach has a lot of benefits such as high level of integration, extremely low cost, no need of external electrical synchronization signals.","doi":"10.1109/MWP.2011.6088762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWP.2011.6088762","startPage":"425","endPage":"428","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics jointly held with the 2011 Asia-Pacific Microwave Photonics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6083218/6088649/06088762.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics jointly held with the 2011 Asia-Pacific Microwave Photonics Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6088649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct sampling of Ka-Band signals using a photoconductive switch approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Direct sampling of Ka-Band signals using a photoconductive switch approach","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6088762/","accessionNumber":"12406244","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6088762/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct sampling of Ka-Band signals using a photoconductive switch approach","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"1092177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041817S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6083218","isNumber":"6088649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6083218","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6088649","articleId":"6088762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6088941,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Brokalakis","affiliation":["Telecommunication Systems Institute, Technical University of Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Brokalakis","id":"37713107600"},{"name":"Vassilis Paliouras","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Vassilis","lastName":"Paliouras","id":"37271413400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1921-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1920-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1919-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"CD","value":"2162-3562"}],"articleNumber":"6088941","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Pipelines","OFDM","Registers","Computer architecture","Approximation methods","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","modems","OFDM modulation","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arithmetic representation properties","FFT circuits","wireless OFDM systems","modem","mixed linear-logarithmic arithmetic data representation","64-point FFT implementation","BER","complement fixed-point representation","LNS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FFT","arithmetic representation","LNS","energy consumption"]}],"abstract":"FFT is one of the most widely used transformations in modern communication systems, especially those based on OFDM. At the same time, it is one of the largest and most power hungry parts of a modem and therefore any effort to reduce its area and energy footprint is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose the use of mixed linear and logarithmic arithmetic data representation in order to reduce the area and more importantly the energy consumption of a 64-point FFT implementation. By adopting BER as the metric to compare the equivalence between different implementations, we demonstrate that small words can be used throughout the FFT system and these allow the combination of a linear two's complement fixed-point representation with LNS. For the same performance levels, this hybrid representation system requires 5% less area and consumes 23% less energy when compared with a pure linear representation implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using the arithmetic representation properties of data to reduce the area and power consumption of FFT circuits for wireless OFDM

constellations improve Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) performance over fading channels. Indeed, an increased diversity is obtained by coupling a constellation rotation with interleaving between the real and imaginary components of transmitted symbols either in time or frequency domain. Iterative processing at the receiver side can provide additional improvement in performance. In this paper, an efficient shuffled iterative receiver is investigated for the second generation of the terrestrial digital video broadcasting standard DVB-T2. Scheduling an efficient message passing algorithm with low latency between the demapper and the LDPC decoder represents the main contribution. The design and the FPGA prototyping of the resultant shuffled iterative BICM receiver are then described. Architecture complexity and measured performance validate the potential of iterative receiver as a practical and competitive solution for the DVB-T2 standard.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6088949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6088949/","accessionNumber":"12406786","displayDocTitle":"A shuffled iterative bit-interleaved coded modulation receiver for the DVB-T2 standard: Design, implementation and FPGA prototyping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A shuffled iterative bit-interleaved coded modulation receiver for the DVB-T2 standard: Design, implementation and FPGA prototyping","confLoc":"Beirut, Lebanon","sourcePdf":"00055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066012S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6086638","isNumber":"6088939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6086638","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6088939","articleId":"6088949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6088955,"authors":[{"name":"Kung-Yen Hsu","affiliation":["Media IC and System, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kung-Yen","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37690500100"},{"name":"Shao-Yi Chien","affiliation":["Media IC and System, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shao-Yi","lastName":"Chien","id":"37279813300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1921-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1920-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1919-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"CD","value":"2162-3562"}],"articleNumber":"6088955","dbTime":"43 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":361},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Motion estimation","Interpolation","Arrays","Engines","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image restoration","interpolation","liquid crystal displays","motion compensation","motion estimation","parallel architectures","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frame rate up-conversion","global motion estimation","motion blur reduction","liquid crystal displays","hardware engine design","FRUC","subsampling technique","parallel hardware architecture","motion compensated interpolation","moving block classifier","GME","on-chip memory","video processing","MCI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frame rate up-conversion (FRUC)","motion compensated interpolation (MCI)","global motion estimation","global-to-local","motion blur","hardware architecture"]}],"abstract":"Frame rate up-conversion (FRUC) with motion compensated interpolation (MCI) is a key operation for motion blur reduction on liquid crystal displays, and dedicated hardware engine design is necessary. In this paper, a hardware architecture for real-time FRUC applications is designed with global motion estimation and compensation. With the concept of motion estimation in low resolution and motion compensation in high resolution, and redesigning several memory bandwidth-hungry modules, a previous work, global-to-local iterative MCI, is modified for hardware design with similar subjective performance. Next, a high-throughput global motion estimation (GME) engine is designed with subsampling technique and parallel hardware architecture, and global motion compensated interpolation and moving block classifier are both designed by sharing the hardware with GME. Moreover, a motion estimation engine is also designed to support various local motion estimation algorithms in different stages. Implementation results show that the proposed GME engine can achieve much higher specifications with limited hardware cost increase.

The implemented DRV computing circuit consists of a built-in-self-test (BIST) unit, a DC-DC converter and some control logic. The proposed technique can be used to accurately measure the DRV to ensure the SRAM operates at its minimum energy point. The circuit was developed in 90nm technology and simulated using HSPICE.

In this paper, we provide an experimental example showing that maximizing code girth can hurt: codes with larger girth can consume significantly larger decoding power. This is because larger girths require increased length of decoder interconnects. Concretely, we show that for (3,4)-regular LDPC codes of girth 6 and 8 decoded using Gallager-A decoding algorithm, the decoders for girth 8 codes can consume up to 36% more power than those for girth 6 codes at high decoding throughputs. Existing results in theoretical literature suggest that this effect will be greatly exaggerated at larger girths and degrees.","doi":"10.1109/SiPS.2011.6088962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6088939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SiPS.2011.6088962","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6086638/6088939/06088962.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The power cost of over-designing codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"The power cost of over-designing codes","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6088962/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406799","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6088962/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The power cost of over-designing codes","confLoc":"Beirut, Lebanon","sourcePdf":"00128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090712S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6086638","isNumber":"6088939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6086638","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6088939","articleId":"6088962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-18"},{"_id":6088972,"authors":[{"name":"Hossam Amer","affiliation":["German University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt","SCI-STI-MM, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Hossam","lastName":"Amer","id":"38241946600"},{"name":"Ab Al-Hadi Ab Rahman","affiliation":["SCI-STI-MM, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ab Al-Hadi Ab","lastName":"Rahman","id":"38194432300"},{"name":"Ihab Amer","affiliation":["German University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ihab","lastName":"Amer","id":"37271963100"},{"name":"Christophe Lucarz","affiliation":["SCI-STI-MM, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Lucarz","id":"37395318300"},{"name":"Marco Mattavelli","affiliation":["SCI-STI-MM, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Mattavelli","id":"37324342000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1921-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1920-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1919-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"CD","value":"2162-3562"}],"articleNumber":"6088972","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methodology and technique to improve throughput of FPGA-based Cal dataflow programs: Case study of the RVC MPEG-4 SP Intra decoder","abstract":"The specification of complex signal processing systems in hardware by means of HDL is no longer the appropriate way since they are known to be time consuming to design, and less flexible to extend features.

for interference mitigation and its implementation on an SDR baseband processor","abstract":"We present the first implementation of a distributed beam-forming algorithm for interference mitigation on an SDR baseband processor. Co-channel interference (CCI) is becoming a major source of impairments in wireless communications and distributed beamforming is a promising technique to mitigate its negative impact. However, such schemes are challenging to implement in practical scenarios due to their complexity and synchronization requirements. In this paper, we report on implementation of a suboptimal, yet efficient, beamforming scheme for CCI mitigation and present the complexity modeling and algorithm transformations for achieving numerically stability. We also present the fixed-point quantization and the proper mapping on a parallel programmable baseband architecture aimed for software-defined radio (SDR). We optimize this algorithm for a coarse grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) processor and evaluate it in the context of the LTE standard.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6088973/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12406810","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6088973/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming for interference mitigation and its implementation on an SDR baseband processor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming for interference mitigation and its implementation on an SDR baseband processor","confLoc":"Beirut, Lebanon","sourcePdf":"00192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058744S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6086638","isNumber":"6088939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6086638","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6088939","articleId":"6088973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6088976,"authors":[{"name":"Junhee Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junhee","lastName":"Cho","id":"38238011800"},{"name":"Wonyong Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wonyong","lastName":"Sung","id":"37290807000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1921-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1920-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1919-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"CD","value":"2162-3562"}],"articleNumber":"6088976","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":726},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6088976","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Iterative decoding","Reliability","Complexity theory","Product codes","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic codes","decoding","error statistics","Hamming codes","product codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complexity reduction","Chase-Pyndiah decoding algorithm","turbo product codes","code length","code rate","test sequences","error probabilities","algebraic decoder","extended Hamming code-based TPC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block codes","linear codes","turbo codes","product codes","iterative decoding"]}],"abstract":"Turbo product codes (TPC) are very suitable for applications requiring a large code length, a high code-rate, and good error performance. In the Chase decoding algorithm, normally a few least reliable positions are selected and the test sequences are generated from these positions. This paper proposes two methods to lower the complexity of the Chase-Pyndiah decoding algorithm. The first scheme reduces the number of least reliable positions by excluding those having relatively low error probabilities. The other one minimizes computations on unnecessary positions in an algebraic decoder. With these methods, we can significantly reduce the number of test sequences and lower the number of utilized positions for constructing an extended candidate codeword set.

For instance, when the raw bit error rate increases from 2.2*10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n to 4.0*10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n, the proposed ECC scheme migrates from RS(127, 121) along rows and Hamming(72,64) along columns to RS(127, 121) along rows and two Hamming(39, 32) along columns to achieve the same BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n. While the resulting implementation has 12% higher decoding latency, it increases the lifetime of the device significantly.","doi":"10.1109/SiPS.2011.6088985","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6086638/6088939/06088985.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SiPS.2011.6088985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6088939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible product code-based ECC schemes for MLC NAND Flash memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Flexible product code-based ECC schemes for MLC NAND Flash memories","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12406822","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6088985/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6088985/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible product code-based ECC schemes for MLC NAND Flash memories","confLoc":"Beirut, Lebanon","sourcePdf":"00255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106427S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6086638","isNumber":"6088939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6086638","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6088939","articleId":"6088985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6088995,"authors":[{"name":"Isael Diaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Isael","lastName":"Diaz","id":"37529432900"},{"name":"Balaji Sathyanarayanan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Balaji","lastName":"Sathyanarayanan","id":"38228117300"},{"name":"Alirad Malek","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Alirad","lastName":"Malek","id":"38111992700"},{"name":"Farzad Foroughi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Farzad","lastName":"Foroughi","id":"37671082100"},{"name":"Joachim Neves Rodrigues","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Joachim Neves","lastName":"Rodrigues","id":"37270890900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1921-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1920-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1919-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"CD","value":"2162-3562"}],"articleNumber":"6088995","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Estimation","Digital video broadcasting","Standards","Computer architecture","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","channel estimation","CMOS integrated circuits","digital video broadcasting","least mean squares methods","Long Term Evolution","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust MMSE channel estimator","OFDM multistandard environment","VLSI implementation","minimum mean square estimator","multistandard channel estimation","time-domain maximum likelihood estimation","TDMLE","least square estimation","MMSE compliant","3GPP LTE","long term evolution","IEEE 802.11n","WLAN","DVB-H","digital video broadcast for handheld devices","high-threshold standard-cell CMOS library","LTE reception"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a VLSI implementation of a highly scalable MMSE (Minimum Mean Square Estimator) is presented with the ultimate goal of demonstrating the potential of MMSE as enabler for multi-standard channel estimation.

The introduced modification enables the application of MacKay scheme for quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes combined with a proposed matrix puncturing scheme based on an also proposed parity-check matrix construction to achieve code-rate compatibility. The proposed encoding scheme and VLSI encoder architecture address the problem of encoding complexity, since about 80% of MacKay encoding algorithm complexity is linearly depended on LDPC check node degree.

In this paper, we propose a new approach based on PHD particle filters (PHD-PF) to automatically track the number of magnetoencephalography (MEG) neural dipole sources and their unknown states. In particular, by separating the MEG measurements using independent component analysis, PHD-PF is applied in a closed-loop to first estimate the number of sources and then recover their amplitude, location and orientation. We also reduce the processing time and computational complexity by employing window-based processing and multi-channel decomposition. We simulate the overall system using synthetic data and show that the proposed algorithm has tracking performance similar to existing approaches with significantly fewer number of particles. We also map the algorithm on to a Xilinx Virtex-5 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform. The processing period for one iteration using 3,200 particles is only about 314 \u03bcs, which makes this implementation suitable for real-time tracking.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6089004/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406841","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Real-time closed-loop tracking of an unknown number of neural sources using probability hypothesis density particle filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time closed-loop tracking of an unknown number of neural sources using probability hypothesis density particle filtering","confLoc":"Beirut, Lebanon","sourcePdf":"00367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061749S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6086638","isNumber":"6088939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6086638","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6088939","articleId":"6089004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6089023,"authors":[{"name":"Saverio Bolognani","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Saverio","lastName":"Bolognani","id":"37404052500"},{"name":"Guido Cavraro","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Cavraro","id":"38228522300"},{"name":"Federico Cerruti","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Cerruti","id":"37846451300"},{"name":"Alessandro Costabeber","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Costabeber","id":"37391584500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0195-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0194-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0193-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089023","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":584},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089023","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load modeling","Mathematical model","Inverters","Power measurement","Analytical models","Reactive power","Voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","invertors","voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear dynamic model","microgrid voltages","distributed generation","distributed microgenerators","microgenerator inverters","voltage measurements","centralized control algorithms","distributed control algorithms","power distribution grid"]}],"abstract":"We consider the scenario of a low voltage microgrid populated by a number of distributed microgenerators.

Compared to traditional networks, data capture faces significant challenges in cognitive radio networks. In traditional wireless networks, one monitor is usually assigned to one channel to capture traffic, which incurs very high cost in a cognitive radio network because the latter typically has a large number of channels. Furthermore, due to the uncertainty of the primary user's activity, cognitive radio devices change their operating channels randomly, which makes data capturing more difficult. In this paper, we propose a systematic method to capture data in cognitive radio networks with a small number of monitors. We utilize incremental support vector regression to predict packet arrival time and intelligently switch monitors between channels. In addition, a protocol is proposed to schedule multiple monitors to perform channel scan and packet capturing in an efficient manner. The real-world experiments and simulations show that our method is able to achieve the packet capture rate above 70% using a small number of monitors, which outperforms the random scheme by 200%-300%.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2011.6089049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089029","startPage":"176","endPage":"185","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel5/6085960/6089029/06089049.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient data capturing for network forensics in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6089049/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient data capturing for network forensics in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406512","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient data capturing for network forensics in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p176chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073277S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6085960","isNumber":"6089029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6085960","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6089029","articleId":"6089049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6089054,"authors":[{"name":"Xuejun Zhuo","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuejun","lastName":"Zhuo","id":"38228567500"},{"name":"Wei Gao","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37307925500"},{"name":"Guohong Cao","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Guohong","lastName":"Cao","id":"37273327300"},{"name":"Yiqi Dai","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yiqi","lastName":"Dai","id":"37278734200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1394-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1392-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1393-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-1648"}],"articleNumber":"6089054","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":86,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":919},"abstract":"3G networks are currently facing severe traffic overload problems caused by excessive demands of mobile users. Offloading part of the 3G traffic through other forms of networks, such as Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), WiFi hotspots, and Femtocells, is a promising solution. However, since these networks can only provide intermittent and opportunistic connectivity to mobile users, utilizing them for 3G traffic offloading may result in a non-negligible delay. As the delay increases, the users' satisfaction decreases. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoff between the amount of traffic being offloaded and the users' satisfaction. We provide a novel incentive framework to motivate users to leverage their delay tolerance for 3G traffic offloading. To minimize the incentive cost given an offloading target, users with high delay tolerance and large offloading potential should be prioritized for traffic offloading. To effectively capture the dynamic characteristics of users' delay tolerance, our incentive framework is based on reverse auction to let users proactively express their delay tolerance by submitting bids. We further take DTN as a case study to illustrate how to predict the offloading potential of the users by using stochastic analysis. Extensive trace-driven simulations verify the efficiency of our incentive framework for 3G traffic offloading.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel5/6085960/6089029/06089054.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"215","publicationTitle":"2011 19th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2011.6089054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2011.6089054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089029","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Win-Coupon: An incentive framework for 3G traffic offloading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Resource management","Mobile communication","Pricing","Bismuth","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","stochastic processes","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["win-coupon","3G traffic offloading","3G networks","traffic overload problems","mobile users","delay tolerant networks","DTN","WiFi hotspots","Femtocells","stochastic analysis","trace-driven simulations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Win-Coupon: An incentive framework for 3G traffic offloading","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089054/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406517","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Win-Coupon: An incentive framework for 3G traffic offloading","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p206zhuo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075649S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6085960","isNumber":"6089029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6085960","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6089029","articleId":"6089054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6089061,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Li","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Li","id":"37308664400"},{"name":"Henggang Cui","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Henggang","lastName":"Cui","id":"38237925300"},{"name":"Yan Hu","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories China, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Hu","id":"38238637400"},{"name":"Yong Xia","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories China, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Xia","id":"37423925600"},{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293614100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1394-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1392-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1393-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-1648"}],"articleNumber":"6089061","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":630},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Steady-state","Information filters","Engines","Matched filters","Servers","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","data communication","Linux","multicast communication","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable data center multicast","multi-class bloom filter","data center group communications","multicast forwarding table memory space","multicast traffic leakage","software based MBF forwarding engine","Linux"]}],"abstract":"Multicast benefits data center group communications in saving network bandwidth and increasing application throughput. However, it is challenging to scale Multicast to support tens of thousands of concurrent group communications due to limited forwarding table memory space in the switches, particularly the low-end ones commonly used in modern data centers. Bloom Filter is an efficient tool to compress the Multicast forwarding table, but significant traffic leakage may occur when group membership testing is false positive. To reduce the Multicast traffic leakage, in this paper we bring forward a novel multi-class Bloom Filter (MBF), which extends the standard Bloom Filter by embracing element uncertainty. Specifically, MBF sets the number of hash functions in a per-element level, based on the probability for each Multicast group to be inserted into the Bloom Filter. We design a simple yet effective algorithm to calculate the number of hash functions for each Multicast group. We have prototyped a software based MBF forwarding engine on the Linux platform. Simulation and prototype evaluation results demonstrate that MBF can significantly reduce Multicast traffic leakage compared to the standard Bloom Filter, while causing little system overhead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable data center multicast using multi-class Bloom Filter","publicationTitle":"2011 19th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2011.6089061","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel5/6085960/6089029/06089061.pdf","startPage":"266","endPage":"275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2011.6089061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089029","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Scalable data center multicast using multi-class Bloom Filter","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089061/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406524","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable data center multicast using multi-class Bloom Filter","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p266li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06561S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6085960","isNumber":"6089029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6085960","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6089029","articleId":"6089061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6089071,"authors":[{"name":"An Chan","affiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"An","lastName":"Chan","id":"38560405900"},{"name":"Henrik Lundgren","affiliation":["Technicolor, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Henrik","lastName":"Lundgren","id":"37296998500"},{"name":"Theodoros Salonidis","affiliation":["Technicolor, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Theodoros","lastName":"Salonidis","id":"37268092400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1394-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1392-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1393-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-1648"}],"articleNumber":"6089071","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","IEEE 802.11n Standard","Wireless communication","Probes","Protocols","Multiplexing","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","encoding","MIMO communication","protocols","video streaming","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video-aware rate adaptation protocol","MIMO WLAN","IEEE 802.11n standard","multiple input multiple output antenna technologies","high definition video streaming","HD video streaming","VARA","video encoding rate variations","wireless channel variations","VBR","variable bit rate","mobile scenarios"]}],"abstract":"The IEEE 802.11n standard supports very high physical layer data rates using Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna technologies.

A key aspect of exploiting this new physical layer (PHY) is rate adaptation, which consists of finding the best rate for sending data packets. Unlike rate adaptation in single antenna systems, nodes have many choices apart from adapting different modulation types, and these choices include using spatial multiplexing or transmit diversity, types of guard intervals, and channel width. We present an evaluation and implementation of a new rate adaptation scheme for multi-antenna systems applicable to off-the-shelf wireless cards. Our rate adaptation scheme, rate adaptation for multi-antenna systems (RAMAS), is simple and practical, and eliminates the complexity of the rate adaptation approaches proposed for IEEE 802.11n in the recent past. Extensive experimental evaluation is used to show that RAMAS performs consistently better than many current IEEE 802.11n rate adaptation schemes with much less complexity, and that RAMAS is especially efficient in multi-user and interference-laden environments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","IEEE 802.11n Standard","Modulation","Throughput","Receivers","Bit rate","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","space division multiplexing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiantenna systems","physical layer","PHY","data packets","single-antenna systems","spatial multiplexing","transmit diversity","guard interval types","channel width","off-the-shelf wireless cards","RAMAS","IEEE 802.11n rate adaptation schemes","multiuser environment","interference-laden environment"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2011.6089072","publicationTitle":"2011 19th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel5/6085960/6089029/06089072.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2011.6089072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A practical approach to rate adaptation for multi-antenna systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A practical approach to rate adaptation for multi-antenna systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089072/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089072/","accessionNumber":"12406535","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practical approach to rate adaptation for multi-antenna systems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p331nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095465S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6085960","isNumber":"6089029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6085960","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6089029","articleId":"6089072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6089076,"authors":[{"name":"Zi Li","affiliation":["Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Zi","lastName":"Li","id":"37404739400"},{"name":"Yang Peng","affiliation":["Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Peng","id":"37715311400"},{"name":"Wensheng Zhang","affiliation":["Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Wensheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278431100"},{"name":"Daji Qiao","affiliation":["Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Daji","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37302366000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1394-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1392-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1393-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-1648"}],"articleNumber":"6089076","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":98,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":760},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Energy consumption","Robot sensing systems","Schedules","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication network routing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint routing","charging scheme","J-RoC","prolong sensor network lifetime","wireless charging technology","perpetual energy source","energy supply","network energy utilization","small-scale testbed","large-scale networks"]}],"abstract":"The emerging wireless charging technology creates a controllable and perpetual energy source to provide wireless power over distance. Schemes have been proposed to make use of wireless charging to prolong the sensor network lifetime. Unfortunately, existing schemes only passively replenish sensors that are deficient in energy supply, and cannot fully leverage the strengths of this technology. To address the limitation, we propose J-RoC - a practical and efficient Joint Routing and Charging scheme. Through proactively guiding the routing activities in the network and delivering energy to where it is needed, J-RoC not only replenishes energy into the network but also effectively improves the network energy utilization, thus prolonging the network lifetime. To evaluate the performance of the J-RoC scheme, we conduct experiments in a small-scale testbed and simulations in large-scale networks. Evaluation results demonstrate that J-RoC significantly elongates the network lifetime compared to existing wireless charging based schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2011.6089076","publicationTitle":"2011 19th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel5/6085960/6089029/06089076.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2011.6089076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"J-RoC: A Joint Routing and Charging scheme to prolong sensor network lifetime","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089076/","displayDocTitle":"J-RoC: A Joint Routing and Charging scheme to prolong sensor network lifetime","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406539","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089076/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"J-RoC: A Joint Routing and Charging scheme to prolong sensor network lifetime","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p373li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095981S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6085960","isNumber":"6089029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6085960","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"6089029","articleId":"6089076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6089079,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Wang","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Illinois Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37309435700"},{"name":"Kui Ren","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Illinois Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Ren","id":"37288795500"},{"name":"Peng Ning","affiliation":["Department of CS, North Carolina State University, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Ning","id":"37269721200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1394-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1392-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1393-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-1648"}],"articleNumber":"6089079","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":860},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Sensors","Receivers","Access protocols","Indexes","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","decision making","jamming","Markov processes","statistical analysis","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antijamming communication","channel statistics","cognitive radio networks","opportunistic spectrum sensing","access protocols","CRN","partially-observed Markov decision process","POMDP","primary user traffic statistics","PU traffic statistics","secondary users","SU","malicious jamming attacks","cognitive attacker","stochastic dynamic decision making process","antijamming multichannel access","nonstochastic multiarmed bandit problem","NS-MAB problem","probability","learning algorithms"]}],"abstract":"Recently, many opportunistic spectrum sensing and access protocols have been proposed for cognitive radio networks (CRNs). For achieving optimized spectrum usage, existing solutions model the spectrum sensing and access problem as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) and assume that the information states and/or the primary users' (PUs) traffic statistics are known a priori to the secondary users (SUs). While theoretically sound, these existing approaches may not be effective in practice due to two main concerns. First, the assumptions they made are not practical, as before the communication starts, PUs' traffic statistics may not be readily available to the SUs. Secondly and more seriously, existing approaches are extremely vulnerable to malicious jamming attacks. A cognitive attacker can always jam the channels to be accessed by leveraging the same statistic information and stochastic dynamic decision making process that the SUs would follow. To address the above concerns, we formulate the problem of anti-jamming multichannel access in CRNs and solve it as a non-stochastic multi-armed bandit (NS-MAB) problem, where the secondary sender and receiver adaptively choose their arms (i.e., sending and receiving channels) to operate. The proposed protocol enables them to hop to the same set of channels with high probability in the presence of jamming. We analytically show the convergence of the learning algorithms, i.e., the performance difference between the secondary sende and receiver's optimal strategies is no more than O(20k/\u221a\u03b5 \u221aTn ln n). Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical analysis and show that the proposed protocol is highly resilient to various jamming attacks.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2011.6089079","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel5/6085960/6089029/06089079.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2011.6089079","publicationTitle":"2011 19th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","startPage":"393","endPage":"402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anti-jamming communication in cognitive radio networks with unknown channel statistics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089079","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Anti-jamming communication in cognitive radio networks with unknown channel statistics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089079/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089079/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406542","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anti-jamming communication in cognitive radio networks with unknown channel statistics","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p393wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079775S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6085960","isNumber":"6089029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6085960","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6089029","articleId":"6089079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6089111,"authors":[{"name":"Liu xiaoxiong","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"xiaoxiong","id":"37541581300"},{"name":"Sun Li Yuan","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Sun Li","lastName":"Yuan","id":"38238857100"},{"name":"Huang Zhiyi","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Huang","lastName":"Zhiyi","id":"38229792800"},{"name":"Chen Kang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Kang","id":"38237980500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1196-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1195-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1194-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089111","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089111","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Feature extraction","Mathematical model","Monitoring","Torque","Aerospace control","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","aerospace control","backpropagation","condition monitoring","fault diagnosis","feature extraction","neural nets","pattern recognition","preventive maintenance","reliability","remaining life assessment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuator fault health management method","fault occurrence prevention","system reliability improvement","neural network pattern recognition technology","flight control system","actuator fault parameter model","fault feature extraction","health situation assessment","remaining life prediction","BP neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["health management","neural networ","pattern recognition","feature extraction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SoCPaR.2011.6089111","pdfPath":"/iel5/6082536/6089089/06089111.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference of Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition (SoCPaR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference of Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition (SoCPaR)","startPage":"227","endPage":"230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SoCPaR.2011.6089111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research of actuator fault health management method based on neural network","abstract":"By using the health management technology the actuators can be timely responded to the fault situation so that it should be used the right approach to solve and prevent the occurrence of the fault and improve the system reliability.

Adequately dealing with such PHEVs is one of the challenges and opportunities for smart grids. In particular, intelligent control strategies for the charging process can significantly alleviate peak load increases that are to be expected from e.g. residential vehicle charging at home. In addition, the car batteries connected to the grid can also be exploited to deliver grid services, and in particular give stored energy back to the grid to help coping with peak demands stemming from e.g. household appliances. In this paper, we will address such so-called vehicle-to-grid (V2G) scenarios while considering the optimization of PHEV charging in a residential scenario. In particular, we will assess the optimal car battery (dis)charging scheduling to achieve peak shaving and reduction of the variability (over time) of the load of households connected to a local distribution grid. We compare (i) a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, without any intelligent charging, (ii) intelligent local charging optimization without V2G, and (iii) charging optimization with V2G. To evaluate these scenarios, we make use of our simulation tool, based on OMNeT++, which combines ICT and power network models and incorporates a Matlab model that allows e.g. assessing voltage violations. In a case study on a three-feeder distribution network spanning 63 households, we observe that non-V2G optimized charging can reduce the peak demand compared to BAU with 64%. If we apply V2G to the intelligent charging, we can further cut the non-V2G peak demand with 17% (i.e., achieve a peak load which is only 30% of BAU).","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE First International Workshop on Smart Grid Modeling and Simulation (SGMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6086032/6089014/06089203.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE First International Workshop on Smart Grid Modeling and Simulation (SGMS)","doi":"10.1109/SGMS.2011.6089203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SGMS.2011.6089203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089014","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting V2G to optimize residential energy consumption with electrical vehicle (dis)charging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Vehicles","Energy consumption","Load modeling","Optimization","Power grids","Schedules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","distribution networks","hybrid electric vehicles","mathematics computing","optimisation","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["V2G","residential energy consumption","electrical vehicle discharging","pluggable hybrid electrical vehicles","PHEV charging","intelligent control strategies","smart grids","vehicle-to-grid","optimization","optimal car battery","local distribution grid","business-as-usual scenario","BAU scenario","OMNeT++","power network models","Matlab model","voltage violations","three-feeder distribution network spanning 63 households"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-17 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting V2G to optimize residential energy consumption with electrical vehicle (dis)charging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089203/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406676","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"17-17 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting V2G to optimize residential energy consumption with electrical vehicle (dis)charging","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p7mets.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078944S","chronDate":"17-17 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6086032","isNumber":"6089014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6086032","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6089014","articleId":"6089203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6089256,"authors":[{"name":"Raphael Torres Santos Carvalho","affiliation":["Department of Teleinformatics Engineering, Federal University of Cear\u00e1, Fortaleza, Brazil"],"firstName":"Raphael Torres Santos","lastName":"Carvalho","id":"38231673300"},{"name":"Charles Casimiro Cavalcante","affiliation":["Department of Teleinformatics Engineering, Federal University of Cear\u00e1, Fortaleza, Brazil"],"firstName":"Charles Casimiro","lastName":"Cavalcante","id":"37284661400"},{"name":"Paulo C\u00e9sar Cortez","affiliation":["Department of Teleinformatics Engineering, Federal University of Cear\u00e1, Fortaleza, Brazil"],"firstName":"Paulo C\u00e9sar","lastName":"Cortez","id":"37323358400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1124-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1122-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1123-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089256","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Discrete wavelet transforms","Diseases","Speech","Pathology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","feature extraction","medical signal processing","neural nets","neurophysiology","patient diagnosis","speech processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transform","artificial neural networks","voice disorder identification","noninvasive diagnosis","painless tests","voice signal processing","voice signal complexity","healthy voice signal characterization","pathological voice signal characterization","mathematical tools","vocal fold nodules","Reinke's edema","neurological dysphonia"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Voice Processing","Wavelet Transform","Artificial Neural Networks","Vocal Fold Nodules","Reinke's Edema"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089256","abstract":"The amount of non-invasive methods of diagnosis has increased due to the need for simple, quick and painless tests.

Recently, there have been several methods proposed for mining imbalanced data streams, in which training data is read in consecutive data chunks. Each data chunk is considered as a conventional imbalanced data set, making it easy to apply sampling methods to balance data chunks. However, one drawback of chunk-based learning methods is that the update of classification models is delayed until a full data chunk is received. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method for online learning from imbalanced data streams, which uses naive Bayes as the base learner. To deal with the problem of class imbalance, a new training instance from the minority class is always involved in learning, but one from the majority class is only used with a small probability. In effect, this method corresponds to an under-sampling technique on imbalanced data streams. We show the effectiveness of the proposed online learning method on ten UCI data sets of various domains. Problems in the performance of naive Bayes on imbalanced data sets are also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6089268/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12405678","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Online learning from imbalanced data streams","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online learning from imbalanced data streams","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"rp065P126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061084S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6082536","isNumber":"6089089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082536","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6089089","articleId":"6089268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6089274,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Aymen Slim","affiliation":["Ecole Nationale dIng\u00e9nieurs de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed Aymen","lastName":"Slim","id":"38228006400"},{"name":"Afef Abdelkrim","affiliation":["Ecole Nationale dIng\u00e9nieurs de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Afef","lastName":"Abdelkrim","id":"37640746400"},{"name":"Mohamed Benrejeb","affiliation":["Ecole Nationale dIng\u00e9nieurs de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Benrejeb","id":"37325220500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1196-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1195-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1194-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089274","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverse problems","Data models","Computational modeling","Biological system modeling","Biological neural networks","Writing","Silicon compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromyography","handwriting recognition","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RBF neural networks","handwriting process modelling","biological repertory","soft computing techniques","artificial neural networks","radial basis function","electromyographic signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Handwriting Process","Modelling","Experimental Approach","Electromyographic Signals","Artificial Neural Networks","RBF Neural Networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089274","abstract":"Handwriting process is one of the most complex processes of our biological repertory.

We also consider the influence of the normalized space between two adjacent subcarriers of the system in average channel capacity analysis. Gaussian approximation method is employed to model multiuser interference (MUI) which mostly degrades the system performance. Hence, probability density function (PDF) of the instantaneous signal to interference noise ratio (SINR) is derived using Characteristic Function (CF) based method. Therefore, the exact closed form expression for the average channel capacity is derived by taking the expectation of Shannon channel capacity over the PDF of SINR. The results reveal that the average channel capacity of the MIMO OMC DS-CDMA system outperforms that of the conventional OMC DS-CDMA system. Similarly, we observe that MIMO MC DS-CDMA system has better spectral efficiency.

In this paper GDL based maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding of Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs) is introduced and a sufficient condition for an STBC to admit low GDL decoding complexity is given. Fast-decoding and multigroup decoding are the two algorithms used in the literature to ML decode STBCs with low complexity. An algorithm which exploits the advantages of both these two is called Conditional ML (CML) decoding. It is shown in this paper that the GDL decoding complexity of any STBC is upper bounded by its CML decoding complexity, and that there exist codes for which the GDL complexity is strictly less than the CML complexity. Explicit examples of two such families of STBCs is given in this paper. Thus the CML is in general suboptimal in reducing the ML decoding complexity of a code, and one should design codes with low GDL complexity rather than low CML complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2011.6089356","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/6081149/6089351/06089356.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2011.6089356","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","startPage":"10","endPage":"14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized distributive law for ML decoding of STBCs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Generalized distributive law for ML decoding of STBCs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089356/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089356/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12405947","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized distributive law for ML decoding of STBCs","confLoc":"Paraty, Brazil","sourcePdf":"p10natarajan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100353S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081149","isNumber":"6089351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081149","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6089351","articleId":"6089356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6089359,"authors":[{"name":"Shurui Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Shurui","lastName":"Huang","id":"37536726600"},{"name":"Aditya Ramamoorthy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Ramamoorthy","id":"37269688700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0437-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0438-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0436-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089359","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Unicast","Interference","Encoding","Network coding","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","linear codes","network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double unicast problem","minimum cut analysis","network coding","directed acyclic networks","multiple unicast capacity region","linear codes","source nodes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An achievable region for the double unicast problem based on a minimum cut analysis","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2011.6089359","startPage":"120","endPage":"124","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/6081149/6089351/06089359.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2011.6089359","abstract":"We consider the multiple unicast problem under network coding over directed acyclic networks when there are two source-terminal pairs, s\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n - t\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n and s\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n - t\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n.

Because of not using any relaxation or any approximate solution like previous works, the found answer with this method is optimal. We can construct optimal variable node degree distribution for any given binary erasure rate, e, and any check node degree distribution. The presented method is implemented and it works well in practice. The time complexity of this method is of polynomial order.

The capacity of a noisy computation is defined and justified by companion coding theorems. Under some constraints on the encoding process, capacity is the upper bound of input rates allowing reliable computation, i.e. decodability of noisy outputs into expected outputs. A model of noisy computation of a perfect function f thanks to an unreliable device F is given together with a model of reliable computation based on input encoding and output decoding. A coding lemma (extending the Feinstein's theorem to noisy computations), a joint source-computation coding theorem and its converse are proved.

The major consideration here is to take into account the (small) size of the alphabet. This amounts to comparing the generic Johnson bound to the q-ary Johnson bound. The most favourable case is q = 2, for which the decoding radius is greatly improved. Even though the announced result, which is the list-decoding radius of binary Goppa codes, is new, we acknowledge that it can be made up from separate previous sources, which may be a little bit unknown, and where the binary Goppa codes has apparently not been thought at. Only D. J. Bernstein has treated the case of binary Goppa codes in a preprint. References are given in the introduction. We propose an autonomous and simplified treatment and also a complexity analysis of the studied algorithm, which is quadratic in the blocklength n, when decoding e-away of the relative maximum decoding radius.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089384/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12405975","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6089384/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"List-decoding of binary Goppa codes up to the binary Johnson bound","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"List-decoding of binary Goppa codes up to the binary Johnson bound","confLoc":"Paraty, Brazil","sourcePdf":"p229augot.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063174S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081149","isNumber":"6089351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081149","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6089351","articleId":"6089384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6089385,"authors":[{"name":"Giuliano G.

We find that the performance of the DCS code is a batter than Random Diagonal (RD) code and Modified Frequency Hopping (MFH) code. Through the mathematical calculation and simulation analysis, for the bit-error rate of DCS code is significantly better than other SAC-OCDMA codes such as RD and MFH codes. We analyze the performance of the proposed codes and examine how the code size and correlation properties are related. Two different decoding schemes are used for implementing the SAC-OCDMA system: Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) and optical Butterworth filter such as Arrayed Wave Guide Grating (AWG) optical filter. Simulation results show that performance of AWG filter is better than Fiber Brag Grating for optical system with 10 Gbps bit rates.

Regularities of driving patterns in time and in space motivate the formation of communities of common backgrounds and interests. We propose a model for forming and maintaining Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs) that uses trust principles for admission to social groups, and controlling the interactions among members. This paper describes the details of the design, and proposes a simple but representative probabilistic model for deriving the probability of wrongful admissions and the probability of an agent trusting a malicious node. The experimental results, which were obtained from simulations using the network simulation software ns2, describe metrics related to the dynamics of group formation and time to form groups as well as to detecting malicious members. Our system was able to form social groups with agents of common interests and maintain an accurate trust evaluation of their behavior.","doi":"10.1109/ISWTA.2011.6089402","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology and Applications (ISWTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology and Applications (ISWTA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6085575/6089386/06089402.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWTA.2011.6089402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Managing Social Networks in vehicular networks using trust rules","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089402/","displayDocTitle":"Managing Social Networks in vehicular networks using trust rules","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406301","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089402/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Managing Social Networks in vehicular networks using trust rules","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"168173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055773S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6085575","isNumber":"6089386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6085575","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6089386","articleId":"6089402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6089404,"authors":[{"name":"Rozeha A.

Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) technique allows cognitive (unlicensed) user (CU) to opportunistically transmit in a primary (licensed) user (PU) frequency band for a given time if it does not detect any ongoing operations. In this work, DSA is realized using cognitive radio (CR) technology due to its features of able to sense, learn, adapt and react according to the environment. The proposed design of the DSA based CR system consists of four main functional blocks: spectrum sensing, spectrum management, spectrum decision and data transmission. The implementation is done using GNU Radio and Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The result shows a significant improvement in term of Packet Reception Rate (PRR) in DSA based CR systems compared to the system without DSA capability.","doi":"10.1109/ISWTA.2011.6089404","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology and Applications (ISWTA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6085575/6089386/06089404.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWTA.2011.6089404","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology and Applications (ISWTA)","startPage":"180","endPage":"185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling dynamic spectrum access for cognitive radio using software defined radio platform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089404","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Enabling dynamic spectrum access for cognitive radio using software defined radio platform","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089404/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089404/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406303","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling dynamic spectrum access for cognitive radio using software defined radio platform","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"180185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078319S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6085575","isNumber":"6089386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6085575","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6089386","articleId":"6089404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6089410,"authors":[{"name":"Wafaa G.

However, traditional genetic algorithms use a single fitness function with weighted terms for different quality attributes. This is inadequate for software architecture design that has to satisfy multiple incomparable quality requirements simultaneously. To overcome this problem, the use of Pareto optimality is proposed. This technique is studied in the presence of two central quality attributes of software architectures, modifiability and efficiency. The technique produces a spectrum of architecture proposals, ranging from highly modifiable (and less efficient) to highly efficient (and less modifiable). The technique has been implemented and evaluated using an example system. The results demonstrate that Pareto optimality has potential for producing a sensible set of architectures in the efficiency-modifiability space.","doi":"10.1109/NaBIC.2011.6089413","startPage":"29","endPage":"36","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6083215/6089255/06089413.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Third World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NaBIC.2011.6089413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generating software architecture spectrum with multi-objective genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Software architecture","Genetic algorithms","Pareto optimization","Proposals","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Pareto optimisation","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software architecture spectrum","multiobjective genetic algorithms","software architecture design","heuristic search method","pareto optimality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pareto optimality","multi-objective genetic algorithm","software design","search-based software engineering","software architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Generating software architecture spectrum with multi-objective genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089413/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12405846","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generating software architecture spectrum with multi-objective genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Salamanca, Spain","sourcePdf":"rp007P014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063795S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6083215","isNumber":"6089255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6083215","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6089255","articleId":"6089413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6089430,"authors":[{"name":"Mamdouh Abbara","affiliation":["INRIA, Le Chesnay, France"],"firstName":"Mamdouh","lastName":"Abbara","id":"38229370900"},{"name":"Jean-Pierre Tillich","affiliation":["INRIA, Le Chesnay, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Pierre","lastName":"Tillich","id":"37283351500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0437-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0438-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0436-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089430","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Convolutional codes","Turbo codes","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","iterative decoding","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum turbo code","unbounded minimum distance","excellent error-reducing code","iterative decoding","very large channel noise value"]}],"abstract":"We construct here a new family of quantum codes related to serial turbo-codes which are excellent error-reducing codes under iterative decoding for very large channel noise values.

We study the performance of spatially coupled low-density generator-matrix ensembles when used for transmission over binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channels. We show by means of density evolution that the threshold saturation phenomenon also takes place in this setting. Our motivation for studying low-density generator-matrix codes is that they can easily be converted into rateless codes. Although there are already several classes of excellent rateless codes known to date, rateless codes constructed via spatial coupling might offer some additional advantages. In particular, by the very nature of the threshold phenomenon one expects that codes constructed on this principle can be made to be universal, i.e., a single construction can uniformly approach capacity over the class of binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channels. We discuss some necessary conditions on the degree distribution which universal rateless codes based on the threshold phenomenon have to fulfill. We then show by means of density evolution and some simulation results that indeed codes constructed in this way perform very well over a whole range of channel types and channel conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2011.6089436","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/6081149/6089351/06089436.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2011.6089436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal rateless codes from coupled LT codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Universal rateless codes from coupled LT codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12405986","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089436/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089436/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal rateless codes from coupled LT codes","confLoc":"Paraty, Brazil","sourcePdf":"p277aref.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045941S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081149","isNumber":"6089351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081149","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6089351","articleId":"6089436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6089437,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Charles Faug\u00e8re","affiliation":["INRIA, Paris-Rocquencourt Center, SALSA Project, UMR 7606, LIP6, UPMC University Paris 06, Paris, France","UMR 7606, LIP6, CNRS, Paris, France","INRIA, SALSA Project - UPMC Univ Paris, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Charles","lastName":"Faug\u00e8re","id":"37550353400"},{"name":"Val\u00e9rie Gauthier-Uman\u00e3","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Val\u00e9rie","lastName":"Gauthier-Uman\u00e3","id":"37073941100"},{"name":"Ayoub Otmani","affiliation":["SECRET Project - INRIA Rocquencourt, Universite de Caen - Ensicaen, Le Chesnay Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Ayoub","lastName":"Otmani","id":"37326612000"},{"name":"Ludovic Perret","affiliation":["INRIA, Paris-Rocquencourt Center, SALSA Project, UMR 7606, LIP6, UPMC University Paris 06, Paris, France","UMR 7606, LIP6, CNRS, Paris, France","INRIA, SALSA Project - UPMC Univ Paris, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Ludovic","lastName":"Perret","id":"37283214200"},{"name":"Jean-Pierre Tillich","affiliation":["SECRET Project - INRIA Rocquencourt, Universite de Caen - Ensicaen, Le Chesnay Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Pierre","lastName":"Tillich","id":"37283351500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0437-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0438-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0436-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089437","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Vectors","Equations","Decoding","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","Goppa codes","matrix algebra","random codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high rate McEliece cryptosystems","Goppa code distinguishing problem","GCD problem","random matrix","polynomial-time","algebraic characterization","key-recovery problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["McEliece's cryptosystem","Algebraic cryptanalysis","Goppa code distinguishing"]}],"abstract":"The Goppa Code Distinguishing (GCD) problem consists in distinguishing the matrix of a Goppa code from a random matrix.

Our technique can solve the GCD problem in polynomial-time provided that the codes have rates sufficiently large. The key ingredient is an algebraic characterization of the key-recovery problem. The idea is to consider the dimension of the solution space of a linearized system deduced from a particular polynomial system describing a key-recovery. It turns out that experimentally this dimension depends on the type of code.

Intermediate nodes in the network employ an amplify-and-forward scheme to relay their input signals. In this case the overall input-output channel from the source via the relays to the destination effectively behaves as an intersymbol interference channel with colored noise. Unlike previous work we formulate the problem of the maximum achievable rate in this setting as an optimization problem with no assumption on the network size, topology, and signal-to-noise ratio. Previous work considered only scenarios wherein relays use all their power to amplify their received signals. We demonstrate that this may not always maximize the achievable rate in amplify-and-forward relay networks. The proposed formulation allows us to not only recover known results on the performance of the amplify-and-forward schemes for some simple relay networks but also characterize the performance of such schemes in more complex relay networks which cannot be addressed in a straightforward manner with existing approaches. Using cut-set arguments, we derive simple upper bounds on the capacity of general wireless relay networks. Through various examples, we show that a large class of amplify-and-forward relay networks can achieve rates within a constant factor of these upper bounds asymptotically in network parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089444/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12405994","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089444/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Amplify-and-forward in wireless relay networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplify-and-forward in wireless relay networks","confLoc":"Paraty, Brazil","sourcePdf":"p311agnihotri.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051442S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081149","isNumber":"6089351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081149","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6089351","articleId":"6089444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6089451,"authors":[{"name":"Omar Abdul-Rahman","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science & Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Abdul-Rahman","id":"38270499200"},{"name":"Masaharu Munetomo","affiliation":["Information Initiative Center, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaharu","lastName":"Munetomo","id":"37330250200"},{"name":"Kiyoshi Akama","affiliation":["Information Initiative Center, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyoshi","lastName":"Akama","id":"37293787700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1124-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1122-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1123-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089451","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Benchmark testing","Genetic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Convergence","Optimization","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary real coded genetic algorithm","real parameter optimization","biologically inspired algorithms","encoding schemes","component algorithms","evolutionary algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["binary coded GA(BGA)","real coded GA(RGA)","Hybrid Scheme","Design of Experiments"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089451","abstract":"Genetic algorithms (GAs) are vital members within the family biologically inspired algorithms. It has been proven that the performance of GAs is largely affected by the type of encoding schemes used to encode optimization problems. Binary and real encoding schemes are the most popular ones. However, it is still controversial to decide the superiority of one of them for GAs performance. Therefore, we have recently proposed binary-real coded GA (BRGA) that has the ability to use both encoding schemes at the same time. BRGA relays on a parameterized hybrid scheme to share the computational power and coordinate the cooperation between binary coded GA (BGA) and real coded GA (RGA). In this paper, we aim to evaluate the performance of BRGA systematically by utilizing CEC'2005 benchmark of 25 problems and adopting a robust experimental analysis approach. The quality and time performance of BRGA against the benchmark suite and in comparison with original component algorithms (BGA and RGA) is reported discussed and analyzed. Moreover, the performance of BRGA is compared with other Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) from the literature.","doi":"10.1109/NaBIC.2011.6089451","startPage":"149","endPage":"156","publicationTitle":"2011 Third World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NaBIC.2011.6089451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089255","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6083215/6089255/06089451.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved binary-real coded genetic algorithm for real parameter optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089451/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An improved binary-real coded genetic algorithm for real parameter optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089451/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12405865","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved binary-real coded genetic algorithm for real parameter optimization","confLoc":"Salamanca, Spain","sourcePdf":"rp026P048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081394S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6083215","isNumber":"6089255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6083215","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6089255","articleId":"6089451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6089464,"authors":[{"name":"Bindu Garg","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Bindu","lastName":"Garg","id":"38241350100"},{"name":"M.M.

In this work, a scheme is proposed that consists in matching, encoding, decoding, and dematching. Only matching is channel specific whereas coding is not.

The messages belong to a finite alphabet and the update functions are simple boolean maps different from the functions used for the belied propagation (BP) decoder. The maps can be chosen using the knowledge of potential trapping sets such that the decoders surpass the BP decoder in the error floor. In this paper, we address the issue of selecting good FAIDs which perform well in the error floor for column weight three codes. We introduce the notion of noisy trapping set which is a generalization based on analyzing the local dynamic behaviour of a given FAID on a trapping set. Using this notion as the core, we provide an iterative greedy algorithm that outputs a set of candidate FAIDs containing potentially good decoders for any given code. To illustrate the appliance of the methodology on several codes, we show that the set of candidate FAIDs contains particularly good FAIDs for different codes with different rates and lengths.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089476/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12406001","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6089476/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the selection of finite alphabet iterative decoders for LDPC codes on the BSC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the selection of finite alphabet iterative decoders for LDPC codes on the BSC","confLoc":"Paraty, Brazil","sourcePdf":"p345danjean.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0495S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081149","isNumber":"6089351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081149","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6089351","articleId":"6089476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6089477,"authors":[{"name":"David G.

Analytical bounds for the BICM capacity are developed. These bounds suggest that the BICM capacity at high signal-to-noise ration (SNR) is determined by the multiplicity of the minimum Euclidean distance over all the subconstellations generated by the mapper. Based on this observation, we conjecture that for any constellation, the highest BICM capacity at high SNR is always obtained by a Gray code, if one exists. Ready-to-use expressions based on Gauss - Hermite quadratures to compute the coded modulation and BICM capacities for any SNR are also presented. Using these expressions, it is shown that the BICM capacity is in general a nonconvex, nonconcave function of the input bit distribution. For 8PAM and 8PSK, there exist 12 and 7 classes of mappings, respectively, with equivalent high-SNR behavior, of which the best class comprises all Gray codes.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2011.6089480","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/6081149/6089351/06089480.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2011.6089480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089351","startPage":"360","endPage":"364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High SNR bounds for the BICM capacity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089480","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High SNR bounds for the BICM capacity","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089480/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406005","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6089480/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High SNR bounds for the BICM capacity","confLoc":"Paraty, Brazil","sourcePdf":"p360alvarado.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111017S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081149","isNumber":"6089351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081149","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6089351","articleId":"6089480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6089487,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad A.

The ability of smart antennas to beamform and hence improve the signal quality at the clients has made them especially attractive for multicasting applications. Unfortunately, the problem of multicast beamforming design is a non-convex optimization problem for which only suboptimal solutions has been proposed in the literature. In this work, we uncover a hidden convexity of the problem under certain channel conditions which happens frequently for practical systems with Rayleigh fading channel model. We propose a solution based on this observation which consists of two steps: (1) we solve the dual problem and check for a uniqueness condition; if satisfied, we show that the duality gap is zero and the solution of the primal problem is obtained based on the solution of the dual problem; (2) if the uniqueness condition is not satisfied, we use a gradient descent based approach. Our evaluations reveal that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the multicast performance over state-of-the-art solutions. Simulation results show that in most scenarios of interest the algorithm converges within a required limit in the first step with high probability. We also obtain the performance bounds for the primal problem based on the dual formulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/6081149/6089351/06089487.pdf","startPage":"395","endPage":"399","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2011.6089487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2011.6089487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089351","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards an optimal beamforming algorithm for physical layer multicasting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Vectors","Fading","Base stations","Optimization","Antennas","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","concave programming","multicast communication","radio networks","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal beamforming algorithm","physical layer multicasting","group communication","wireless networks","signal quality","multicast beamforming design","nonconvex optimization","Rayleigh fading channel","dual problem","uniqueness condition","duality gap","primal problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Towards an optimal beamforming algorithm for physical layer multicasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089487/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406012","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards an optimal beamforming algorithm for physical layer multicasting","confLoc":"Paraty, Brazil","sourcePdf":"p395khojastepour.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066716S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081149","isNumber":"6089351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081149","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6089351","articleId":"6089487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6089488,"authors":[{"name":"Anatoly Khina","affiliation":["EE-Systems Department, TAU, Tel Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Anatoly","lastName":"Khina","id":"37396405300"},{"name":"Yuval Kochman","affiliation":["EE-Systems Department, TAU, Tel Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Yuval","lastName":"Kochman","id":"37402457900"},{"name":"Uri Erez","affiliation":["EE-Systems Department, TAU, Tel Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Uri","lastName":"Erez","id":"37284119700"},{"name":"Gregory W.

A closed-loop setup is considered where the channel matrices are known to the transmitter and respective receivers. An incremental-redundancy (rateless) scenario is considered, where the effective rate is measured by the time that each user needs to stay online until it is able to decode the message. A practical transmission scheme for the two-user case is proposed which, by linear pre - and post-processing combined with successive decoding and interference cancellation, transforms the two MIMO channels into a set of parallel channels with no loss of mutual information, where each user needs to tune in for a duration of time proportional to its individual capacity. This scheme is used for designing a practical transmission scheme for the Gaussian MIMO half-duplex relay channel. We then turn to the related scenario of transmission to a single user over a MIMO channel with unknown but constant signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), for which we develop an optimal low-complexity hybrid ARQ coding scheme, which is optimal for two SNRs and propose a scheme for more SNRs, the loss of which vanishes when the SNRs are high. Finally, we show that even when applied to single-input single-output (\u201cscalar\u201d) channels, the scheme provides a practical solution for cases not covered by previous work.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2011.6089488","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/6081149/6089351/06089488.pdf","startPage":"400","endPage":"404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2011.6089488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental coding over MIMO channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089488/","displayDocTitle":"Incremental coding over MIMO channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089488/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental coding over MIMO channels","confLoc":"Paraty, Brazil","sourcePdf":"p400khina.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067207S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081149","isNumber":"6089351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081149","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6089351","articleId":"6089488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":6089490,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan Gabrys","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Gabrys","id":"38575893600"},{"name":"Eitan Yaakobi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Eitan","lastName":"Yaakobi","id":"37546078500"},{"name":"Lara Dolecek","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Lara","lastName":"Dolecek","id":"37295938100"},{"name":"Paul H.

Those designs are in general secure and possess no undesirable features that cannot be corrected by a proper choice of parameters and a careful implementation (i.e. semantically secure conversion). Their security reduction is, for the systems who do not require a trapdoor decoder, as good as possible as we have an exact reduction to the syndrome decoding problem, the hardness of which conveys an extreme confidence. For public-key systems (encryption, signature) there exists no really threatening (non exponential) attacks but the security reduction involves other problems (indistinguishability of families of codes) which offer some confidence but which also need to be considered with more hindsight, in particular for variants with reduced key size (typically using quasi-cyclic or quasi-dyadic codes). The security reductions of code-based cryptosystems rely on well identified problems and in that sense are well founded. We hope that the problems we expose here will attract some attention and eventually help to produce even better reductions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089492/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12406017","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6089492/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The tightness of security reductions in code-based cryptography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The tightness of security reductions in code-based cryptography","confLoc":"Paraty, Brazil","sourcePdf":"p415sendrier.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074171S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081149","isNumber":"6089351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081149","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6089351","articleId":"6089492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6089493,"authors":[{"name":"Song-Nam Hong","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Song-Nam","lastName":"Hong","id":"38239277300"},{"name":"Giuseppe Caire","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Caire","id":"37267243200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0437-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0438-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0436-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089493","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":348},"abstract":"We consider a low-complexity version of the Compute and Forward scheme that involves only scaling, offset (dithering removal) and scalar quantization at the relays.

We prove analytically that all LDPC convolutional codes in the family are capacity achieving over the binary erasure channel (BEC). Thus, if applied to an idealized HARQ system over the BEC where the channel parameter stays constant within one complete information delivery, the throughput achieves the capacity of the channel.

Here, the task is to recall a previously memorized pattern from its noisy version using a network of neurons whose states assume values from a finite number of non-negative integer levels. Prior works in this area consider storing a finite number of purely random patterns, and have shown that the pattern retrieval capacities (maximum number of patterns that can be memorized) scale only linearly with the number of neurons in the network. In our formulation of the problem, we consider storing patterns from a suitably chosen set of patterns, that are obtained by enforcing a set of simple constraints on the coordinates (such as those enforced in graph based codes). Such patterns may be generated from purely random information symbols by simple neural operations. Two simple neural update algorithms are presented, and it is shown that our proposed mechanisms result in a pattern retrieval capacity that is exponential in terms of the network size. Furthermore, using analytical results and simulations, we show that the suggested methods can tolerate a fair amount of errors in the input.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2011.6089532","startPage":"80","endPage":"84","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/6081149/6089351/06089532.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2011.6089532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exponential pattern retrieval capacity with non-binary associative memory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Noise","Biological neural networks","Vectors","Associative memory","Information theory","Graph theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exponential pattern retrieval capacity","non-binary associative memory","neural association","non-binary neurons","memorized pattern","non-negative integer levels","neural update algorithms","network size"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Exponential pattern retrieval capacity with non-binary associative memory","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089532/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406057","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exponential pattern retrieval capacity with non-binary associative memory","confLoc":"Paraty, Brazil","sourcePdf":"p80kumar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081149","isNumber":"6089351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081149","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6089351","articleId":"6089532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":6089542,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Ma","affiliation":["CTO Research, Nokia Siemens Networks, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085358925"},{"name":"G\u00fcnter Kompa","affiliation":["Microwave Electronics Laboratory, University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"G\u00fcnter","lastName":"Kompa","id":"37266937500"},{"name":"Aexl Bangert","affiliation":["Microwave Electronics Laboratory, University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Aexl","lastName":"Bangert","id":"37288073900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1497-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1496-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1495-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-7843"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-7851"}],"articleNumber":"6089542","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":344},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Power amplifiers","Power measurement","Integrated circuit interconnections","Scattering parameters","Integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","field effect MMIC","gallium arsenide","HEMT integrated circuits","III-V semiconductors","MMIC power amplifiers","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["first-pass design","RF circuit design","wireless communications","partitioning design approach","class-AB RF power amplifier","HEMT technology","post-fabrication tuning work","frequency 2.14 GHz","AlGaAs-GaAs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RF Power Amplifier","First-pass success design","Partitioning Design Approach"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089542","abstract":"In this paper, a novel RF circuit design concept, namely, Partitioning Design Approach (PDA) is proposed.

Spectrum sensing action must be performed as quickly as possible to obtain a good throughput performance. However, quick sensing makes the fidelity of sensing outcome becomes low. On the other hand, a long sensing time leads to the low throughput performance. Hence, it is important to find out how secondary users (SUs) in opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) system can improve the throughput performance while maintaining sensing time low. In this paper we study the fundamental design of spectrum sensing and throughput performance for cognitive radio (CR) user with limited sensing capability in OSA system. In the first done, we consider 3% of one slot is allocated for spectrum sensing action and observe the throughput performance by varying the channel measurement sample. The Optimal throughput performance is achieved at certain value of sample number and reduces as increasing it. Subsequently, we observed the throughput performance as a function of spectrum sensing slot allocation as well. Increasing the allocation for spectrum sensing action can degrade the throughput performance. Computer simulations are presented to evaluate the performances.","doi":"10.1109/ISWTA.2011.6089555","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology and Applications (ISWTA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6085575/6089386/06089555.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWTA.2011.6089555","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology and Applications (ISWTA)","startPage":"66","endPage":"71","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sensing and throughput performance in opportunistic spectrum access system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sensing and throughput performance in opportunistic spectrum access system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089555/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089555/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406322","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sensing and throughput performance in opportunistic spectrum access system","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"066071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053488S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6085575","isNumber":"6089386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6085575","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6089386","articleId":"6089555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6089556,"authors":[{"name":"Hamidreza Bakhshi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamidreza","lastName":"Bakhshi","id":"37391805700"},{"name":"Babak Sabooniha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Science and Research, Branch Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Babak","lastName":"Sabooniha","id":"38229376100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1497-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1496-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1495-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-7843"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-7851"}],"articleNumber":"6089556","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Receivers","MIMO","Wireless communication","Delay","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","interpolation","least squares approximations","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM system","feedback branch","multi input multi output orthogonal frequency division multiplex system","channel estimation","block type pilot arrangement Management","maximal ratio receiver combining technique","MRRC technique","least square method","LS method","channel interpolation","linear interpolation","Stanford university interim channel models","SUI channel models","bit error rate","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel Estimation","Cyclic Prefix (CP)","Delay Spread","MIMO-OFDM"]}],"abstract":"Channel estimation techniques for Multi Input Multi Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (MIMO-OFDM) systems based on a pilot arrangement are investigated.

This behavior, which contrasts sharply with that of many commonly studied wiretap channels, is made possible by the fact that a small number of linear projections can make a crucial difference in the ability to estimate sparse vectors.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2011.6089562","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/6081149/6089351/06089562.pdf","startPage":"548","endPage":"552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2011.6089562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compressed sensing wire-tap channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089562/","displayDocTitle":"A compressed sensing wire-tap channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406061","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089562/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compressed sensing wire-tap channel","confLoc":"Paraty, Brazil","sourcePdf":"p548reeves.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064569S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081149","isNumber":"6089351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081149","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6089351","articleId":"6089562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6089563,"authors":[{"name":"Mikko Vehkaper\u00e4","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and the ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Vehkaper\u00e4","id":"37268980400"},{"name":"Saikat Chatterjee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and the ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Saikat","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37626130500"},{"name":"Mikael Skoglund","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and the ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mikael","lastName":"Skoglund","id":"37265042800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0437-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0438-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0436-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089563","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":385},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Noise measurement","Compressed sensing","Noise","Estimation","Conferences","Physics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE estimation","compressive sensing","block sparse signal","minimum mean square error estimation","noisy linear measurement","closed form solution","optimum estimator","Tse-Hanly formula","nonzero blocks","nonrigorous replica method"]}],"abstract":"Minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation of block sparse signals from noisy linear measurements is considered. Unlike in the standard compressive sensing setup where the non-zero entries of the signal are independently and uniformly distributed across the vector of interest, the information bearing components appear here in large mutually dependent clusters. Using the replica method from statistical physics, we derive a simple closed-form solution for the MMSE obtained by the optimum estimator. We show that the MMSE is a version of the Tse-Hanly formula with system load and MSE scaled by a parameter that depends on the sparsity pattern of the source. It turns out that this is equal to the MSE obtained by a genie-aided MMSE estimator which is informed in advance about the exact locations of the non-zero blocks. The asymptotic results obtained by the non-rigorous replica method are found to have an excellent agreement with finite sized numerical simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of MMSE estimation for compressive sensing of block sparse signals","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2011.6089563","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/6081149/6089351/06089563.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2011.6089563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089351","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of MMSE estimation for compressive sensing of block sparse signals","conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089563/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406062","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of MMSE estimation for compressive sensing of block sparse signals","confLoc":"Paraty, Brazil","sourcePdf":"p553vehkapera.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089172S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081149","isNumber":"6089351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081149","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6089351","articleId":"6089563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6089564,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Calderbank","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Calderbank","id":"37283818900"},{"name":"Sina Jafarpour","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Sina","lastName":"Jafarpour","id":"37296626500"},{"name":"Maria Nastasescu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Nastasescu","id":"38193789500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0437-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0438-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0436-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089564","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Vectors","Linear code","Symmetric matrices","Sensors","Compressed sensing","Coherence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","data compression","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","linear codes","matrix algebra","probability","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["restricted isometry property","k-sparse signals","binary linear code","probability","random Bernoulli process","asymptotic analysis","eigenvalues","random submatrices","Bernoulli matrix","compressed sensing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089564","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/6081149/6089351/06089564.pdf","startPage":"558","endPage":"562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2011.6089564","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2011.6089564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089351","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Covering radius and the Restricted Isometry Property","abstract":"The Restricted Isometry Property or RIP introduced by Candes and Tao requires an n \u00d7 p dictionary to act as a near isometry on all k-sparse signals.

Information bits, encoded in the time variations of the concentration of molecules, are conveyed to the receiver front through the molecular diffusion in the medium. The receiver, in turn, measures the concentration of the molecules in its vicinity in order to retrieve the information. This is done via ligand-reception process. In this paper, we develop models to study the constraints imposed by the concentration sensing at the receiver side and derive the maximum rate by which a ligand-receiver can receive information. Therefore, the overall capacity of the diffusion channel with the ligand receptors can be obtained by combining the results presented in this paper with our previous work on the achievable information rate of molecular communication over the diffusion channel.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2011.6089591","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/6081149/6089351/06089591.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2011.6089591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089351","startPage":"85","endPage":"89","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of diffusion-based molecular communication with ligand receptors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of diffusion-based molecular communication with ligand receptors","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089591/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406090","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6089591/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of diffusion-based molecular communication with ligand receptors","confLoc":"Paraty, Brazil","sourcePdf":"p85einolghozati.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0878S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6081149","isNumber":"6089351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081149","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6089351","articleId":"6089591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6089609,"authors":[{"name":"Bindu Garg","affiliation":["Department of Computer Eng, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Bindu","lastName":"Garg","id":"38241350100"},{"name":"M.M.

Firstly, OWA weights are determined on the basis of importance of fuzzy set in the system by employing regularly increasing monotonic (RIM) quantifiers. Subsequently, genetic algorithm is employed to generate wide range of parameters for fuzzy membership functions (mf) in the region of time series. Lastly, forecasted value is obtained by OWA aggregation of past fuzzy observations generated at prior time (t, t-1, t-2). Proposed optimized forecasting model has been compared with some pre-existing models on same data. Results demonstrate that forecasting performance of the proposed model has greatly improved by reducing mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).","doi":"10.1109/NaBIC.2011.6089609","pdfPath":"/iel5/6083215/6089255/06089609.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"290","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing","publicationTitle":"2011 Third World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NaBIC.2011.6089609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Employing genetic algorithm to optimize OWA-fuzzy forecasting model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Employing genetic algorithm to optimize OWA-fuzzy forecasting model","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12405893","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6089609/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Employing genetic algorithm to optimize OWA-fuzzy forecasting model","confLoc":"Salamanca, Spain","sourcePdf":"rp048P076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137355S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6083215","isNumber":"6089255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6083215","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6089255","articleId":"6089609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6089612,"authors":[{"name":"G.

During an epileptic seizure, the onset of which tends to be sudden and without prior warning, sufferers are highly vulnerable to harm, and methods that might accurately predict seizure episodes in advance are clearly of value. Building on recent work by Costa et al, we compare and contrast the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of a selection of algorithms that attempt to predict the onset of epileptic seizures on the basis of 14 features extracted from electroencephalograph (EEG) monitoring data. We focus on how predictability varies as a function of how far in advance we are trying to predict the seizure episode, and also consider feature selection issues. We find that, using either a multi-class support vector machine (MC-SVM) or an evolved neural network (EANN), reasonable specificity and sensitivity can be achieved for prediction 8-10 minutes in advance. Indications are that the EANN performance is preferable for advance prediction, however the results so far do not support this with statistical significance. Meanwhile, we find that with a well-chosen reduced feature set (using mutual information), promising results can be obtained with only 8 of the 14 features. Further analysis showed that the accumulated energy in the signal, the maximum Lyupanov exponent, as well as measures of high-frequency signal components measured over short term windows, seem most promising for future research into accurate advance prediction models.","doi":"10.1109/NaBIC.2011.6089646","publicationTitle":"2011 Third World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6083215/6089255/06089646.pdf","startPage":"540","endPage":"545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NaBIC.2011.6089646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating bio-inspired approaches for advance prediction of epileptic seizures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089646/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating bio-inspired approaches for advance prediction of epileptic seizures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12405928","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089646/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating bio-inspired approaches for advance prediction of epileptic seizures","confLoc":"Salamanca, Spain","sourcePdf":"rp090P131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064252S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6083215","isNumber":"6089255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6083215","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6089255","articleId":"6089646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6089659,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Flexible MCASIP architecture templates allow matching the instruction and task level parallelism provided by the processor to the requirements of the application at hand. The processing throughput provided by shared memory (SM) multicores is commonly limited by the SM bandwidth. Synchronizing the execution of multiple threads using lock variables residing in the SM further adds to the bottleneck. In this paper we present a technique to reduce the SM contention in the case of MCASIPs where application-specific hardware customization can be used. The proposed solution is to use customized Datapath Integrated Lock Units (DILU) that enable the implementation of light weight synchronization primitives which minimize SM traffic. The paper presents an experiment with a 48-core MCASIP which shows that the SM impact of the proposed fast barrier based on DILU in comparison to a basic SM polling one is up to 64% smaller. The size of the DILU hardware is negligible.","doi":"10.1109/ISSOC.2011.6089685","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on System on Chip (SoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on System on Chip (SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6085645/6089208/06089685.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSOC.2011.6089685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Customizable Datapath Integrated Lock Unit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2011-Nov. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Customizable Datapath Integrated Lock Unit","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6089685/","accessionNumber":"12406368","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Customizable Datapath Integrated Lock Unit","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"p27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080396S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2011-Nov. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6085645","isNumber":"6089208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6085645","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6089208","articleId":"6089685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6089695,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian H\u00f6ppner","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"H\u00f6ppner","id":"37543012100"},{"name":"Dennis Walter","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Walter","id":"38569613800"},{"name":"Georg Ellguth","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Ellguth","id":"37393982500"},{"name":"Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fcffny","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Ren\u00e9","lastName":"Sch\u00fcffny","id":"37266953100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0672-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0671-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0670-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089695","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Delay","Jitter","System-on-a-chip","Histograms","Estimation","Calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","network-on-chip","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed NoC link","network-on-chip link","asynchronous sub-sampling technique","sampling clock","MPSoC","multiprocessing system-on-chip","on-chip interconnect","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["asynchronous subsampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089695","abstract":"This paper presents asynchronous sub-sampling techniques to measure delay mismatch of clock and data lanes in high-speed serial network-on-chip (NoC) links.

Then a time-domain window function with adaptive parameters, which are decided in terms of the estimated information of the impulsive noise and the carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR), is employed to suppress the impulsive interference. In order to solve the inter-channel interference (ICI) due to suppression of OFDM signal, linear programming based equalization is further estimated.

In this scheme, called Matrix Coded Modulation (MCM), a joint channel error-correcting code and space-time code is considered. Coherent systems are those for which Channel State Information (CSI) is available at the transmitters and/or at the receivers, and their performance strongly depend on the channel estimation. Generally, this CSI estimation requires the insertion of pilot-symbols in the transmitted frame which implies a spectral efficiency loss of the global system. The existing non-coherent MIMO systems like Differential Space Time Modulation (DSTM) suffer not only from the degradation of performance compared to coherent systems, but also from many constraints on the channel and the use of memory at reception. In the proposed MCM scheme, decoding can be achieved with or without CSI at the receiving antennas. Moreover, a low-complexity decoding algorithm is described and compared to the existing differential schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new non-coherent MIMO scheme: Matrix Coded Modulation \u201cMCM\u201d","publicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089714","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6082086/6089698/06089714.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A new non-coherent MIMO scheme: Matrix Coded Modulation \u201cMCM\u201d","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089714/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12407974","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new non-coherent MIMO scheme: Matrix Coded Modulation \u201cMCM\u201d","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"p120elarab.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09885S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6082086","isNumber":"6089698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082086","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6089698","articleId":"6089714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6089718,"authors":[{"name":"Jiping Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jiping","lastName":"Li","id":"37598851100"},{"name":"Shixun Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shixun","lastName":"Wu","id":"38240795700"},{"name":"Shouyin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shouyin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280148500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1295-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1294-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1293-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089718","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"abstract":"Signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) based call admission control (CAC) scheme admits incoming calls as long as the measured SINR is higher than threshold value (SINR\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>\n).

intelligently employs multiple antennas to greatly strengthen the robustness against signal fading in wireless networks. Simulation results show that the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed system is remarkably better than the conventional multi-access FM-DCSK UWB systems under indoor residential environments of the IEEE 802.15.4a standard by means of obtaining the spatial diversity gain. Furthermore, the influence of antenna number of relay to the proposed system is also investigated to provide a good compromise between the system performance and implementation complexity. For these advantages above, the proposed system can be seen as a viable alternative to other FM-DCSK UWB schemes for the low-rate and low-power applications in wireless personal area networks (WPAN).","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089721","publicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6082086/6089698/06089721.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel MIMO relay FM-DCSK UWB system for low-rate and low-power WPAN applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089721","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089721/","displayDocTitle":"A novel MIMO relay FM-DCSK UWB system for low-rate and low-power WPAN applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12407981","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089721/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel MIMO relay FM-DCSK UWB system for low-rate and low-power WPAN applications","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"p159fang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059396S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6082086","isNumber":"6089698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082086","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6089698","articleId":"6089721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6089728,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenxing Luo","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Information Security Control Laboratory, Jiaxing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenxing","lastName":"Luo","id":"38239794500"},{"name":"Caiyi Lou","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Information Security Control Laboratory, Jiaxing, China"],"firstName":"Caiyi","lastName":"Lou","id":"37603783100"},{"name":"Shichuan Chen","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Information Security Control Laboratory, Jiaxing, China"],"firstName":"Shichuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086487399"},{"name":"Shilian Zheng","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Information Security Control Laboratory, Jiaxing, China"],"firstName":"Shilian","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37598057800"},{"name":"Shaowei Li","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Information Security Control Laboratory, Jiaxing, China"],"firstName":"Shaowei","lastName":"Li","id":"38239837700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1295-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1294-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1293-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089728","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"abstract":"Cognitive Radio (CR) is considered as an effective technology for alleviating the spectrum shortage problem by enabling secondary users to utilize vacant spectrum allocated to a primary user (PU).

Through data symbol grouping and block transformation, the BT-OFDM uses reduced size inverse fast Fourier transform to take the advantages of the single-carrier system to overcome the disadvantages of the conventional OFDM system. Frequency domain representation of the BT-OFDM signal reveals that the block transformation implicitly realizes a precoding or block spreading of the transmitted data symbols. When suitable IFFT size is selected, the BT-OFDM also offers the lowest overall system complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block transform OFDM: A robust power and bandwidth efficient system with improved frequency diversity performance","publicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089734","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6082086/6089698/06089734.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089734","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Block transform OFDM: A robust power and bandwidth efficient system with improved frequency diversity performance","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089734/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12407992","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block transform OFDM: A robust power and bandwidth efficient system with improved frequency diversity performance","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"p205xue.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051339S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6082086","isNumber":"6089698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082086","xplore-issue":"6089698","articleId":"6089734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6089736,"authors":[{"name":"Shilian Zheng","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Information Security Control Laboratory, Jiaxing, China"],"firstName":"Shilian","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37598057800"},{"name":"Xiaoniu Yang","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Information Security Control Laboratory, Jiaxing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoniu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37593922900"},{"name":"Caiyi Lou","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Information Security Control Laboratory, Jiaxing, China"],"firstName":"Caiyi","lastName":"Lou","id":"37603783100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1295-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1294-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1293-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089736","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cognitive radio","Convergence","Network topology","Algorithm design and analysis","FCC","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","distributed algorithms","frequency allocation","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed consensus algorithm","decision fusion","cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","primary user detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","consensus","cooperative spectrum sensing"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed consensus algorithms for decision fusion based cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089698","endPage":"221","publicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6082086/6089698/06089736.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089736","startPage":"217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089736","abstract":"Spectrum sensing is one of the fundamental problems for cognitive radio.

It states that the salient information of a signal can be recovered from a relatively small number of linear projections. In wireless networks, anomaly detection is an attractive application. Current research shows that it is promising to apply CS into sparse anomaly network detection, as the number of abnormal events seems much smaller than the total number of nodes. In this article, we firstly propose an ameliorated reconstruction method for abnormal event detection in noise-involved wireless networks, where no prior information is needed. Second, we improve this method to solve a distributed anomaly detection problem considering energy consumption and detection accuracy. Finally, we analyze the performance of our scheme in different conditions. Simulation shows that our detection algorithm proves to be valid and much energy can be saved by the distributed scheme with acceptable performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed anomaly event detection in wireless networks using compressed sensing","publicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089743","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6082086/6089698/06089743.pdf","startPage":"250","endPage":"255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Distributed anomaly event detection in wireless networks using compressed sensing","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089743/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408001","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed anomaly event detection in wireless networks using compressed sensing","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"p250xia.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071313S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6082086","isNumber":"6089698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082086","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6089698","articleId":"6089743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6089752,"authors":[{"name":"Haibin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Haibin","lastName":"Li","id":"37539775300"},{"name":"David Grace","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Grace","id":"37269106100"},{"name":"Paul D.

In a distributed open spectrum sharing situation, decisions regarding channel assignment and the p-persistent probability level are made by each individual cognitive radio user considering historical transmission experiences. Through the learning process, cognitive radio users are expected to avoid each other, and maintain an optimum transmission rather than contending for a channel.

The application of coherent detection and multi-level modulation format makes the laser phase noise to be one of the major factors that would influence the system performance, and a carrier phase estimator is necessary to track the time-varying phase changes caused by the phase noise in such systems. On the other hand, electronic channel equalization can be used to compensate for fiber dispersion, but the interaction of the carrier phase estimator and the channel equalizer can not be ignored any more. This paper proposes a method to combine the electronic channel equalization module with carrier phase estimation module in electric field at the receiver side of the coherent optical fiber communication systems. The phase estimation is achieved after the electric equalization and the results from the phase estimation are feed-backed to the electric equalization for the equalizer's tap coefficients updating. When both phase estimation and electronic channel equalization are used in the system, smaller step-size for electric equalization can be used for lower bit error rate, more stable error performance and longer transmission distance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving

Firstly, we derive the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement factor MN of the colocated MIMO radar array output compare to single-input single-output (SISO) radar array output employing coherent integration, where M is the number of orthogonal transmitted signals and N is the number of receive array elements. Secondly, we derive the array output's SNR expression from radar equation perspective. With the expression, we get the colocated MIMO radar equivalent array gain via comparing the array output's SNR expressions of colocated MIMO radar and SISO radar. Then we obtain the colocated MIMO radar equation without considering the antenna electromagnetic effect.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A derivation of colocated MIMO radar equation","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving (ICCP)","doi":"10.1109/ICCPS.2011.6089762","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving (ICCP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6082087/6089760/06089762.pdf","startPage":"674","endPage":"677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCPS.2011.6089762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089762/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A derivation of colocated MIMO radar equation","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089762/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408213","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A derivation of colocated MIMO radar equation","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"B6158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066007S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6082087","isNumber":"6089760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082087","xplore-issue":"6089760","articleId":"6089762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6089763,"authors":[{"name":"Haiwei Liu","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, UESTC, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Haiwei","lastName":"Liu","id":"38239573500"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Li","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, UESTC, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37559847200"},{"name":"Xiaoxiang Liu","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, UESTC, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"38240609600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0603-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0602-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0600-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0601-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089763","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A joint sparse signal reconstruction and channel estimation for UWB communication system","abstract":"Ultra-wideband(UWB) radio has gained a major breakthrough in wireless communications. However, the sampling is a huge obstacle to it. Applying compressed sensing(CS) principle which can recover a sparse signal from less measurement to UWB communication has been a hot topic for many years. This paper shows two methods to construct the CS model for UWB communication, jointing the signal reconstruction and channel estimation together using the CS approach, one takes a suitable sensing matrix to process the received signal and the other exploits the channel itself as a sensing process. A comparison is made at last between the CS based method and the traditional one. The simulation results demonstrate that our jointing CS method can achieve better performance at low SNR and high bit rate.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6082087/6089760/06089763.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"664","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving (ICCP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCPS.2011.6089763","doi":"10.1109/ICCPS.2011.6089763","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving (ICCP)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089763","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Vectors","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Ultra wideband communication","Mathematical model","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","compressed sensing","matrix algebra","signal reconstruction","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse signal reconstruction","channel estimation","UWB communication system","ultra-wideband radio","wireless communication","compressed sensing","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ultra-wideband","compressed sensing","sparse","channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089763/","displayDocTitle":"A joint sparse signal reconstruction and channel estimation for UWB communication system","accessionNumber":"12408214","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6089763/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A joint sparse signal reconstruction and channel estimation for UWB communication system","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"B6248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046377S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6082087","isNumber":"6089760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082087","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6089760","articleId":"6089763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6089767,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Chen","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"38241290700"},{"name":"Linli Cui","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Linli","lastName":"Cui","id":"38237353900"},{"name":"Chaoran Qi","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Chaoran","lastName":"Qi","id":"38231076100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0603-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0602-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0600-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0601-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089767","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089767","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Unicast","Interpolation","Frequency domain analysis","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","interpolation","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","pilot aided channel estimation","MBSFN","LTE system","linear interpolation","noninterpolation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MBSFN","pilot extracting","channel estimation","LTE"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the performance of the channel estimation methods (LS, LMMSE, ALMMSE) for MBSFN in LTE system.

In this paper, the matrix pencil method (MPM) is applied to synthesize a sparse planar array. The sparse planar array is designed to a separable planar array by a product of two orthogonal linear sparse arrays. In order to obtain these two orthogonal sparse linear arrays, firstly two desired radiation patterns are designed according to the demands. Then the two desired patterns are sampled and reconstructed by using the MPM. Due to the advantages of the MPM, the element positions and excitations can be optimized simultaneously. And very low computational cost is needed for this process. A min-max criterion is also proposed for calculating the weights in the MPM. The method for planar array optimization addressed in this paper is easy to be implemented and has low computational cost. Several simulation cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving (ICCP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6082087/6089760/06089772.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"85","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving (ICCP)","doi":"10.1109/ICCPS.2011.6089772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCPS.2011.6089772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of sparse planar arrays with matrix pencil method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planar arrays","Transmission line matrix methods","Apertures","Chebyshev approximation","Optimization","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","linear antenna arrays","planar antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse planar arrays","matrix pencil method","main lobe width","peak side lobe level","orthogonal linear sparse arrays","antenna radiation patterns","planar array optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["planar array","matrix pencil method","pattern synthesis","sparse array"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of sparse planar arrays with matrix pencil method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089772/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408223","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of sparse planar arrays with matrix pencil method","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"C1174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057696S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6082087","isNumber":"6089760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082087","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6089760","articleId":"6089772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6089774,"authors":[{"name":"Byeong-Yun Chang","affiliation":["Department of Business Administration, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byeong-Yun","lastName":"Chang","id":"37529123200"},{"name":"Byeongsik Kim","affiliation":["Internet Research Laboratory, ETRI, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byeongsik","lastName":"Kim","id":"37534754000"},{"name":"Seunghyun Yoon","affiliation":["Internet Research Laboratory, ETRI, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seunghyun","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37279393800"},{"name":"Dong-Won Seo","affiliation":["School of Management and Management Research Institute, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Won","lastName":"Seo","id":"38008179900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0603-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0602-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0600-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0601-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089774","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a federated cloud computing effect.

Stimulation shows that the improved method is prior to the traditional algorithms respectively while achieving the purpose of Channel Estimation.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6082087/6089760/06089776.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"67","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving (ICCP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCPS.2011.6089776","doi":"10.1109/ICCPS.2011.6089776","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving (ICCP)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089776","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Estimation","Transfer functions","OFDM","Frequency domain analysis","Noise","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computational complexity","least mean squares methods","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE uplink","improved pilot-aided channel estimation","mobile communication system","sounding reference signal","channel quality information","conjugate cancel channel estimation","computational complexity","MMSE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","Channel Estimation","Sounding Reference Signal","Least Square"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089776/","displayDocTitle":"Improved Pilot-Aided channel estimation in LTE uplink","accessionNumber":"12408227","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6089776/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Pilot-Aided channel estimation in LTE uplink","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"C125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037656S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6082087","isNumber":"6089760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082087","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6089760","articleId":"6089776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6089778,"authors":[{"name":"Shunkun Yang","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shunkun","lastName":"Yang","id":"38239652400"},{"name":"Feichi Long","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feichi","lastName":"Long","id":"38008201900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0603-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0602-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0600-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0601-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089778","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Maximum likelihood decoding","Approximation methods","Belief propagation","Detection algorithms","Lagrangian functions","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief propagation based detection","MIMO systems","joint maximum likelihood detection","optimization framework","Bethe approximation"]}],"abstract":"Belief propagation (BP) based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection algorithm can achieve near optimal performance, but the technical analysis remains unsolved.

We consider that a secondary user may access the spectrum allocated to a primary user as long as the average interference power, inflicted at the primary's receiver as an effect of the transmission of the secondary user, remains below predefined power limits. We consider partial channel information of the link between the secondary user transmitter and primary user receiver is available to the secondary user. We derive the optimal power allocation strategy to achieve the maximum effective capacity under Rayleigh fading with imperfect channel information. Finally, we also obtained expressions for the average expenditure-power required to achieve the effective capacity with channel estimation error variance. Numerical results are conducted to corroborate our theoretical results.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCPS.2011.6089786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089760","startPage":"232","endPage":"235","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving (ICCP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6082087/6089760/06089786.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental effective capacity limits of cognitive radio in fading environments with imperfect channel information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6089786/","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental effective capacity limits of cognitive radio in fading environments with imperfect channel information","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408237","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental effective capacity limits of cognitive radio in fading environments with imperfect channel information","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"C2199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044227S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6082087","isNumber":"6089760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082087","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6089760","articleId":"6089786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6089787,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Lin","affiliation":["Chongqing Communication Institute, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Lin","id":"38237323000"},{"name":"You Chunyan","affiliation":["Center of Communication and Tracking Telemetering Command, Chongqing University, China"],"firstName":"You","lastName":"Chunyan","id":"37602827900"},{"name":"Du Guoxin","affiliation":["Chongqing Communication Institute, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Du","lastName":"Guoxin","id":"38242171500"},{"name":"He Tonglin","affiliation":["Department of computing, Chongqing Vocational Institute of Engineering, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Tonglin","id":"38230382500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0603-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0602-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0600-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0601-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089787","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Loading","OFDM","Bit error rate","Energy consumption","Complexity theory","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","energy conservation","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast adaptive loading","OFDM","energy consumption intensity analysis","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","energy efficiency","computation complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive modulation","Frequency division multiaccess","energy conservation","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"A fast approach of adaptive loading for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDM) is proposed.

The CSI among the secondary users are easy to collect by exchanging transmitting and received signal power. However, it is not reasonable to require the CSI between secondary users and primary users since primary users should not send feedbacks to secondary users. Location information has also been used to describe the interference relationship. In this method, primary users' position can be collected by received signal strength based localization approach. Therefore, localization error always exists in localization methods and has not been considered in resource allocation problems. In this paper, we formulate the primary user's position uncertainty as a perturbation. A robust optimization algorithm is proposed for this perturbed problem.

Encoded in DNA","abstract":"The goal of DNA data embedding is to enable robust encoding of non-genetic information in DNA. This field straddles the areas of bioinformatics and digital communications, since DNA mutations can be seen as akin to a noisy channel from the point of view of information encoding. In this paper we present two algorithms which, building on a variant of a method proposed by Yachie et al., rely on repetition coding to effectively counteract the impact that mutations have on an embedded message. The algorithms are designed for resynchronising multiple, originally identical, information encoded DNA sequences, embedded within non-coding DNA (ncDNA) sections of a host genome. They use both BLAST and MUSCLE algorithms to accomplish this. Bit error rates at the decoder are established for mutations rates accumulated over a number of generations of the host organism. The empirical results obtained are compared to a theoretical bound for optimal decoding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12406876","htmlLink":"/document/6089836/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Repetition Coding as an Effective Error Correction Code for Information Encoded in DNA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repetition Coding as an Effective Error Correction Code for Information Encoded in DNA","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4391a253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099641S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088020","isNumber":"6089804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088020","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6089804","articleId":"6089836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6089868,"authors":[{"name":"Tomoyuki Hiroyasu","affiliation":["Department of Life and Medical Sciences, Doshisha University, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoyuki","lastName":"Hiroyasu","id":"37280858300"},{"name":"Yota Miyabe","affiliation":["Graduate School of Life and Medical Sciences, Doshisha University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yota","lastName":"Miyabe","id":"37086649041"},{"name":"Hisatake Yokouchi","affiliation":["Department of Life and Medical Sciences, Doshisha University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hisatake","lastName":"Yokouchi","id":"37603466900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1589-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4121-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4122-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1557-170X"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"6089868","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089868","abstract":"Here, we propose a training data selection method using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the effects of anticancer drugs. Conventionally, SVM is used for distinguishing between several types of data. However, in the method proposed here, the SVM is used to distinguish areas with only one or two types of data. The proposed method treats training data selection as an optimization problem and involves application of a genetic algorithm (GA). Moreover, GA with local search was applied to find the solution as the target problem was difficult to find. The composition method of GA for proposed method was examined. To determine its effectiveness, the proposed method was applied to an artificial anticancer drug data set. The verification results showed that the proposed method can be used to create a verifiable and predictable discriminant function by training data selection.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6089868","startPage":"124","endPage":"128","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6067544/6089866/06089868.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6089868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training data selection method for prediction of anticancer drug effects using a genetic algorithm with local search","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","drugs","genetic algorithms","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["training data selection method","genetic algorithm","support vector machine","optimization problem","artificial anticancer drug effects","predictable discriminant function"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Antineoplastic Agents","Artificial Intelligence","Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted","Humans","Neoplasms","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Treatment Outcome"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 3 2011","displayDocTitle":"Training data selection method for prediction of anticancer drug effects using a genetic algorithm with local search","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089868/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2012","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12436167","pubMedId":"22254266","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training data selection method for prediction of anticancer drug effects using a genetic algorithm with local search","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00312366.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045305S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 3 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6067544","isNumber":"6089866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6067544","xplore-issue":"6089866","articleId":"6089868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6089885,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Ha Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jong-Ha","lastName":"Lee","id":"38185801600"},{"name":"Chang-Hee Won","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Chang-Hee","lastName":"Won","id":"37287389600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1589-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4121-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4122-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1557-170X"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"6089885","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Optical waveguides","Estimation","Phantoms","Algorithm design and analysis","Sensors"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Breast","Elastic Modulus","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Finite Element Analysis","Hardness","Humans","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Nephelometry and Turbidimetry","Neural Networks (Computer)","Phantoms, Imaging","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we developed a methodology for estimating three parameters of tissue inclusion: size, depth, and Young's modulus from the tactile data obtained at the tissue surface with the tactile sensation imaging system.

The forward algorithm is designed to comprehensively predict the tactile data based on the mechanical properties of the tissue inclusion. This forward information is used to develop an inversion algorithm that will be used to extract the size, depth, and Young's modulus of a tissue inclusion from the tactile image. The proposed method is then validated with custom made tissue phantoms with matching elasticities of typical human breast tissues.

Due to the limited sensing capability of CR, the secondary user cannot sense all the channels simultaneously. How to design intelligent sensing strategy is crucial to track the varying spectrum opportunities. However, the availability probability of each channel is not known a prior. The need to learning the information creates a fundamental trade-off between exploration and exploitation. First, the scenario in which a single cognitive user wishes to opportunistically exploit the availability of idle spectrum is considered. An index based strategy from the classical multi-armed bandit problem is efficient to achieve asymptotically optimal performance. Then, the multiuser case is considered. However, the index based strategy for the single user cannot be applied to multiuser scenario directly. If so, collisions among secondary users degrade the overall network performance greatly. We find that randomized selection of the channel to sense is essential to avoid collisions. We extend the exploration and exploitation idea to the multiuser scenario and come up with a randomization based mixed strategy which takes the activity of other secondary users into consideration in the learning process and at the same time achieves exploration and exploitation tradeoff. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve near optimal in terms of total network performance as the centralized scenario without any information exchange among cognitive users.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089953","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6082086/6089698/06089953.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089953","publicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","startPage":"360","endPage":"365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploration vs exploitation for distributed channel access in cognitive radio networks: A multi-user case study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089953","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Exploration vs exploitation for distributed channel access in cognitive radio networks: A multi-user case study","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089953/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089953/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408023","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploration vs exploitation for distributed channel access in cognitive radio networks: A multi-user case study","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"p360wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064642S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6082086","isNumber":"6089698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082086","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6089698","articleId":"6089953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6089957,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Lai","id":"37711319600"},{"name":"Eryk Dutkiewicz","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Eryk","lastName":"Dutkiewicz","id":"38299196300"},{"name":"Ren Ping Liu","affiliation":["ICT Centre, CSIRO, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Ren Ping","lastName":"Liu","id":"37534182900"},{"name":"Rein Vesilo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Rein","lastName":"Vesilo","id":"37388742700"},{"name":"Gengfa Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Gengfa","lastName":"Fang","id":"37286480000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1295-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1294-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1293-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089957","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":270},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089957","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Optimization","Joints","Admission control","Markov processes","Measurement","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network selection","cooperative cognitive radio networks","secondary users","network handover","Markov chain models","blocking probability","forced termination probability","completion probability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089957","publicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6082086/6089698/06089957.pdf","startPage":"378","endPage":"383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network selection in cooperative cognitive radio networks","abstract":"This paper studies network selection issues in cooperative cognitive radio networks (CRNs) where secondary users (SUs) have access to the combined spectrum pool of cooperating CRNs.

We subsequently propose three network selection schemes and theoretically evaluate their performance using corresponding Markov chain models. Our numerical results indicate that a jointly-optimized network selection scheme which takes into account both the number of free channels and the traffic intensity of primary users in each CRN obtains the lowest probability of SU handover. Furthermore, compared to the random selection scheme, the jointly-optimized network selection scheme achieves significant reduction in SU handover probability while having no negative impact on other performance metrics of secondary users, such as blocking probability, forced termination probability and completion probability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089957/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12408027","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089957/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Network selection in cooperative cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network selection in cooperative cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"p378lai.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054062S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6082086","isNumber":"6089698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082086","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6089698","articleId":"6089957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6089961,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Sun","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Sun","id":"37873250300"},{"name":"Xing Yang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37289760700"},{"name":"Daoben Li","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Daoben","lastName":"Li","id":"37277108000"},{"name":"Li Fang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Fang","id":"37399317800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1295-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1294-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1293-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089961","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receiving antennas","Bit error rate","Transmitting antennas","Correlation","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","error statistics","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-maximum-likelihood detection","spatially correlated MIMO system","cutting plane","antenna correlation","bit error rate performance","lattice reduction detection scheme","serial interference cancellation detection scheme","semidefinite relaxation detection scheme","ill conditioned channel matrix"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new efficient scheme is proposed for the fast detection in spatially correlated MEMO systems.

Simulation results show clearly that with the ill conditioned channel matrix, the new detection strategy outperforms the other schemes, while its complexity remains cubic to the number of antennas plus the number of cutting planes added.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-maximum-likelihood detection in spatially correlated MIMO systems using semi-definite relaxation with cutting planes","publicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089961","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6082086/6089698/06089961.pdf","startPage":"412","endPage":"416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Near-maximum-likelihood detection in spatially correlated MIMO systems using semi-definite relaxation with cutting planes","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6089961/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408031","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-maximum-likelihood detection in spatially correlated MIMO systems using semi-definite relaxation with cutting planes","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"p412sun.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081953S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6082086","isNumber":"6089698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082086","xplore-issue":"6089698","articleId":"6089961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6089963,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaorong Xu","affiliation":["Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Information, Network Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaorong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37402623500"},{"name":"Aiping Huang","affiliation":["Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Information, Network Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Aiping","lastName":"Huang","id":"37275718700"},{"name":"Jianrong Bao","affiliation":["College of Telecommunication Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jianrong","lastName":"Bao","id":"37535123200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1295-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1294-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1293-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089963","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":545},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Energy consumption","Bit error rate","Fading","Signal to noise ratio","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio networks","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency analysis","cooperative sensing","cognitive radio networks","energy consumption problem","energy constrained cognitive radio networks","green energy saving cognitive communication","cooperative secondary user","spectrum sharing process","transmission energy consumption","exact closed form expression","BPSK modulation","MQAM modulation","BER performance","minimum energy consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks (CRN)","Energy efficiency","Cooperative sensing and sharing","Transmission energy consumption","Cooperative SU set"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6089963","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089963","publicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","abstract":"This paper investigates energy consumption problem in cooperative spectrum sensing and sharing in energy-constrained Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN). With the aim of the realization of green energy-saving cognitive communications, we mainly analyze energy efficiency in the process of cooperative sensing and transmission. Robust cooperative sensing technique is presented with the consideration of sensing channel SNR and reporting channel SNR. In addition, the error rates of transmission between cooperative secondary users (SUs) are also taken into account, which are more practical than traditional cooperative sensing analysis. In spectrum sharing process, an analytical expression of transmission energy consumption and an exact closed-form expression of average BER with BPSK and MQAM modulation are derived. Based on the minimization of energy consumption, optimization algorithm is presented in order to obtain the whole average BER performance with the minimum energy consumption. Optimal cooperative SU number sets are also presented under certain transmission distance constraint. Simulation results confirm our derivation. It is indicated that the analysis of cooperative sensing and sharing provides a significant way for energy saving in CRN.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6089698","startPage":"422","endPage":"427","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6082086/6089698/06089963.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficiency analysis of cooperative sensing and sharing in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6089963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6089963/","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficiency analysis of cooperative sensing and sharing in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408033","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficiency analysis of cooperative sensing and sharing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"p422xu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060364S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6082086","isNumber":"6089698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082086","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6089698","articleId":"6089963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6089964,"authors":[{"name":"Shashika Biyanwilage","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Western Sydney, Penrith, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Shashika","lastName":"Biyanwilage","id":"37847361300"},{"name":"Upul Gunawardana","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Western Sydney, Penrith, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Upul","lastName":"Gunawardana","id":"37294101900"},{"name":"Ranjith Liyanapathirana","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Western Sydney, Penrith, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Ranjith","lastName":"Liyanapathirana","id":"37372854300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1295-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1294-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1293-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6089964","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Resource management","OFDM","Optimization","Manganese","Correlation","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation method","nonregenerative OFDM relay links","outdated channel knowledge","two-hop OFDM relay link","channel state information","CSI","baseline method"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the power allocation problem in a two-hop OFDM relay link with a nonregenarative relay where the available channel state information (CSI) is an outdated version of the actual instantaneous CSI.
