We focus on protecting physical devices from illegal access by intruders and give basic analysis for fundamental gaps between physical devices and embedded IoT softwares. We clarify that the critical difficulty in IoT security is implementing both of device functions and IoT functions on a same physical device. We also propose the IoT Agent Platform mechanism to separate IoT functions from physical devies and to run isolated IoT functions on cloud environment. The mechanism is based on the Dripcast which is a transparent programming framework for IoT devices where we don't care about communication, server-side programming nor database, at all. The Dripcast provides a very simple and easy development model which is a key for device vendors to develop physical devices to use IoT functions.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 41st Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 41st Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8027037/8029872/08030012.pdf","startPage":"684","endPage":"689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IoT Agent Platform Mechanism with Transparent Cloud Computing Framework for Improving IoT Security","doi":"10.1109/COMPSAC.2017.156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8029872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC.2017.156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030012/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"IoT Agent Platform Mechanism with Transparent Cloud Computing Framework for Improving IoT Security","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17174125","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030012/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IoT Agent Platform Mechanism with Transparent Cloud Computing Framework for Improving IoT Security","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"0367b684.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081512S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8027037","isNumber":"8029872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8027037","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8029872","articleId":"8030012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8030034,"authors":[{"name":"Bingbing Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China","Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8030034/zhang-2750322-small.gif","p":["Bingbing Zhang received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering and the M.S. degree in electronic science and technology from the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), Changsha, China, in 2011 and 2013, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Electronic Science and Engineering.

With advances of technologies, underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) become promising tools for AUV tracking. Due to the energy constraint of underwater nodes, energy saving is a key issue that affects all aspects of the design of a tracking scheme. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient tracking scheme for an AUV to locate itself in time by UWSNs. We first design a tracking protocol considering the energy consumptions in both the AUV and sensor nodes (SNs). Particularly, the protocol is designed in two aspects: 1) the passive listening mechanism and duty-cycle strategy for the AUV and 2) the detection-based ranging packet transmission for SNs. Since the tracking protocol will inevitably affect the packet delivery between the AUV and SNs, we analyze the packet delivery success rate (PDSR) to shed light on the impact of system parameters on the tracking performance. To cope with non-linearity of the model and the intermittent observations mainly arisen from the effect of the tracking protocol, we adopt two extended versions of the original intermittent Kalman filter for tracking. They are intermittent extended Kalman filter and intermittent unscented Kalman filter. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking scheme, and reveal that the PDSR analysis provides a design guidance for parameter selection in system configuration.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2750322","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08030034.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2750322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"18016","endPage":"18032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking a Duty-Cycled Autonomous Underwater Vehicle by Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Tracking a Duty-Cycled Autonomous Underwater Vehicle by Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030034/","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8030034/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17246466","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Major Research Development Program of Hunan Province of China","grantNumber":"2016JC2008"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016T90978"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61604176, 61633017, 61773264, 61471237 and 61301223"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Tracking a Duty-Cycled Autonomous Underwater Vehicle by Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-2750322-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136889S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8030034","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8030038,"authors":[{"name":"Hsuan-Yun Kao","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3/7997986/8030038/kao-2750414-small.gif","p":["Hsuan-Yun Kao received the B.S. degree from the Department of Photonics, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2015.

The multi-mode VCSEL chip with the largest aperture of 11 \u03bcm reveals the widest spectral linewidth and the highest optical power, but provides the smallest modulation bandwidth to support only 44and 28-Gb/s data rates for back-to-back (BtB) and 100-m OM4 MMF transmission cases, respectively. By shrinking the aperture size to reduce transverse-mode number, the few-mode VCSEL with the strongest throughput power enables a BtB transmission capacity as high as 52 Gb/s. However, its modal dispersion induced after OM4 MMF transmission inevitably degrade the data rate to 32 Gb/s. In contrast, the single-mode VCSEL with the smallest aperture of 3 \u03bcm reveals the highest modulation bandwidth and negligible modal dispersion to show competitive BtB transmission capacity with that of the few-mode VCSEL.

A novel method of improving the performance of CSAA by the variable universe adaptive fuzzy logic system (VUAFLS) is studied. We develop the VUAFLS to adjust the annealing temperature, which is a very important parameter governing the performance of CSAA, and this algorithm is named VUAFLS-CSAA. The main innovations of VUAFLS-CSAA lie in the application of VUAFLS containing the fast cooling mechanism and reheating mechanism relative to the characteristic of the sustained temperature fall of CSAA. Compared with the conventional method for controlling annealing temperature, VUAFLS-CSAA can control the annealing temperature more effectively, leading to the high efficiency of CSAA. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with CSAA through two examples. One is the image restoration problem, and the other is the traveling salesman problem (TSP). The experimental result indicates that the new method proposed in this paper can improve the efficiency of CSAA by tremendously shortening the iteration optimization process. And at the same time, the successful application of the new method for tackling two different problems demonstrates the generality of this method. In addition, techniques that can further improve the performance of CSAA are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030049/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17246468","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8030049/","publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Approach to Improve the Performance of Simulated Annealing Algorithm Utilizing the Variable Universe Adaptive Fuzzy Logic System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51275061 and 61672121"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Approach to Improve the Performance of Simulated Annealing Algorithm Utilizing the Variable Universe Adaptive Fuzzy Logic System","sourcePdf":"access-qin-2750399-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121773S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8030049","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8030054,"authors":[{"name":"Yuehua Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Yuehua","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085635570"},{"name":"He Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0001-8886-9680","id":"37539867600"},{"name":"Yonghui Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Yonghui","lastName":"Li","id":"37279887100"},{"name":"Zhiguo Ding","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, Lancaster, U.K."],"firstName":"Zhiguo","lastName":"Ding","orcid":"0000-0001-5280-384X","id":"37278653500"},{"name":"Li Zhuo","affiliation":["Signal and Information Processing Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhuo","id":"38351500300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8030054","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1135},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Signal to noise ratio","NOMA","MIMO","Quality of service","Interference","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","cognitive radio","MIMO communication","probability","quality of service","signal processing","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-form expression","outage performance","SJ-AS","minimal outage probability","possible joint AS schemes","MIMO cognitive radio-inspired NOMA systems","joint antenna selection","nonorthogonal multiple access network","computationally efficient joint AS algorithm","signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)","cognitive radio (CR)","antenna selection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030054","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8170462/08030054.pdf","startPage":"2658","endPage":"2661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2750153","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2750153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna Selection in MIMO Cognitive Radio-Inspired NOMA Systems","abstract":"This letter investigates a joint antenna selection (AS) problem for a MIMO cognitive radio-inspired non-orthogonal multiple access network.

However, many challenges remain and one big issue is how to provide an efficient spectrum management in a mobile environment. In this paper, we propose a new prediction-based spectrum management strategy to tackle this challenge. Both spectrum prediction and users' mobility prediction are fully considered in the proposed strategy. Combining the prediction information and cooperative sensing, a CR base station can obtain the sensing information for future location of each secondary user, so as to prearrange high-quality channels for secondary users ahead of time. In addition, we propose a new channel selection scheme when multiple channels are available simultaneously. Besides traditional decision factors, the new channel selection algorithm takes the channel's future availability obtained from spectrum prediction into account. By properly integrating the spectrum prediction, user mobility prediction, and channel selection, the new spectrum management strategy is capable of allocating the spectrum resource more efficiently. Extensive simulations are conducted and results verify that the proposed spectrum management strategy significantly improves the system performance in terms of reducing handoff times and improving user satisfactory, connection reliability, and channel utilization.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4267003/8543256/8030058-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and

Herein, a local structural sparse Bayesian learning (LS-SBL) algorithm is proposed by exploiting the joint sparsity pattern of adjacent scatterers. A structured prior by modeling the neighboring correlation or dependence is utilized to encode the joint sparsity pattern. Meanwhile, a parametric dictionary with unknown rotational parameters is constructed to represent the target maneuverability. The solution to the LS-SBL algorithm is decomposed into iterations between sparse imaging and dictionary learning. In sparse imaging, an expectation-maximization method is employed for ISAR image formation and hyperparameter estimation by using a predesigned dictionary. In dictionary learning, an efficient approach of rotational parameter estimation is presented to dynamically update the parametric dictionary. Due to the exploitation of joint sparsity pattern, enhanced performance of ISAR image reconstruction can be achieved by effectively preserving the target structure. In addition, the cross-range scaled ISAR image is obtainable by extracting the target geometry, which benefits from the rotational motion estimation. Finally, experiments on simulated and measured data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745852/8098624/08030079.pdf","startPage":"940","endPage":"952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TCI.2017.2750330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2017.2750330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8098624","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced ISAR Imaging and Motion Estimation With Parametric and Dynamic Sparse Bayesian Learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","Radar imaging","Machine learning","Motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","expectation-maximisation algorithm","image reconstruction","image resolution","iterative methods","least squares approximations","motion estimation","parameter estimation","radar imaging","radar resolution","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rotational parameter estimation","parametric dictionary","joint sparsity pattern","high-resolution inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging","expectation-maximization method","cross-range scaled ISAR image formation","predesigned dictionary","hyperparameter estimation","dictionary learning","sparse imaging","LS-SBL algorithm","target maneuverability","unknown rotational parameters","neighboring correlation","local structural sparse Bayesian learning algorithm","compressively sampled echo data","dynamic sparse Bayesian learning","parametric Bayesian learning","rotational motion estimation","target geometry","target structure","ISAR image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sampling","inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR)","sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)","structured prior","dictionary learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030079/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced ISAR Imaging and Motion Estimation With Parametric and Dynamic Sparse Bayesian Learning","volume":"3","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8030079/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17352647","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000947","fundingName":"AcRF Tier-1","grantNumber":"RG103/14 and Tier-2 MOE2014-T2-1-079"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced ISAR Imaging and Motion Estimation With Parametric and Dynamic Sparse Bayesian Learning","sourcePdf":"tci-bi-2750330-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156067S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"8098624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8098624","articleId":"8030079","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":8030088,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Ren","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Technion City, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/8071125/8030088/ren-2750419-small.gif","p":["Yi Ren received the B.Sc. degree from the Ecole Polytechnique, France, in 2014, and the M.Sc. degree from the Department of Computer Science, Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, in 2017.

This problem consists of modeling the desired type of images, either through training examples or via a parametric modeling, and then generating images that belong to the same statistical origin. This paper addresses the image synthesis task, focusing on two specific families of images-handwritten digits and face images. This paper offers two main contributions. First, we suggest a simple and intuitive algorithm capable of generating such images in a unified way. The proposed approach taken is pyramidal, consisting of upscaling and refining the estimated image several times. For each upscaling stage, the algorithm randomly draws small patches from a patch database and merges these to form a coherent and novel image with high visual quality. The second contribution is a general framework for the evaluation of the generation performance, which combines three aspects: the likelihood, the originality, and the spread of the synthesized images. We assess the proposed synthesis scheme and show that the results are similar in nature, and yet different from the ones found in the training set, suggesting that true synthesis effect has been obtained.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2750419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2750419","startPage":"220","endPage":"235","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8071125/08030088.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8071125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Example-Based Image Synthesis via Randomized Patch-Matching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Example-Based Image Synthesis via Randomized Patch-Matching","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2017","volume":"27","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8030088/","accessionNumber":"17303995","pubMedId":"28910768","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030088/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council through the EU 7th Framework Programe, ERC","grantNumber":"320649"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israel Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1770/14"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Example-Based Image Synthesis via Randomized Patch-Matching","sourcePdf":"tip-ren-2750419-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108623S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8071125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","xplore-issue":"8071125","articleId":"8030088","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8030096,"authors":[{"name":"Sachini Jayasooriya","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computing, The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8214934/8030096/jayas-2750179-small.gif","p":["Sachini Jayasooriya (S\u201913) received the B.Sc. degree (Hons.) in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from The University of Newcastle, Australia, in 2017.

In this regard, we first represent Raptor codes as multi-edge type (MET) low-density parity-check codes. This MET representation gives a general framework to analyze and design Raptor codes over a binary input additive white Gaussian noise channel using MET density evolution (MET-DE). We then consider a joint decoding scheme based on the belief propagation (BP) decoding for Raptor codes in the multi-edge framework, and analyze the convergence behavior of the BP decoder using MET-DE. In joint decoding of Raptor codes, the component codes corresponding to the inner code and the precode are decoded in parallel and provide information to each other. We also derive an exact expression for the stability of Raptor codes with joint decoding. We then propose an efficient Raptor code design method using the multi-edge framework, where we simultaneously optimize the inner code and the precode. Through density evolution analysis we show that the designed Raptor codes using the multi-edge framework outperform the existing Raptor codes in literature in terms of realized rates.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2750179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2750179","startPage":"5123","endPage":"5136","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8214934/08030096.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8214934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Design of Raptor Codes Using a Multi-Edge Framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design of Raptor Codes Using a Multi-Edge Framework","volume":"65","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17431451","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030096/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"LP130100783 and FT110100195"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design of Raptor Codes Using a Multi-Edge Framework","sourcePdf":"tcomm-jayasooriya-2750179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089422S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8214934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8214934","articleId":"8030096","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8030103,"authors":[{"name":"Imen Mahjri","affiliation":["HANA Research Laboratory, University of Manouba, Manouba, Tunisia"],"bio":{"p":["Imen Mahjri received the MS and the main engineering diploma both in\n computer science from ENSI, in 2011 and 2013, respectively.

In this paper, we first propose a comprehensive analytical framework for a three dimensional conflict detection. Then, we propose SLIDE a new Straight LIne conflict DEtection and alerting algorithm for a set of UAVs to safely share a common airspace. SLIDE is fully distributed and requires a limited state information exchange between UAVs. The assumptions of precise state information and packet-loss free communications are relaxed so as to guarantee the applicability and efficiency of the algorithm in real world situations. A thorough discussion is also presented to deal with appropriate tuning of the different parameters of the collision detection framework. Extensive simulations based on OMNeT++ are used to validate SLIDE and evaluate its performance. Simulation results indicate that SLIDE guarantees a reduced number of false and missed alarms even in high density traffic scenarios and communication perturbed environments, yet it leaves adequate time to accomplish the required maneuver actions.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2017.2750144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/8330738/08030103.pdf","startPage":"1190","endPage":"1203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2017.2750144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8330738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SLIDE: A Straight Line Conflict Detection and Alerting Algorithm for Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"SLIDE: A Straight Line Conflict Detection and Alerting Algorithm for Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8030103/","accessionNumber":"17683820","volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"1 May 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University","grantNumber":"RGP-1436-031"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SLIDE: A Straight Line Conflict Detection and Alerting Algorithm for Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tmc-belghith-2750144-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104741S","chronDate":"May 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"8330738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8330738","articleId":"8030103","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8030107,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/8071125/8030107/chen-2750413-small.gif","p":["Jie Chen (S\u201913\u2013M\u201916) received the B.S. and M.

One of the emerging technologies is light field (LF) cameras based on micro-lens arrays. To record the directional information of the light rays, a much larger storage space and transmission bandwidth are required by an LF image as compared with a conventional 2D image of similar spatial dimension. Hence, the compression of LF data becomes a vital part of its application. In this paper, we propose an LF codec with disparity guided Sparse Coding over a learned perspective-shifted LF dictionary based on selected Structural Key Views (SC-SKV). The sparse coding is based on a limited number of optimally selected SKVs; yet the entire LF can be recovered from the coding coefficients. By keeping the approximation identical between encoder and decoder, only the residuals of the non-key views, disparity map, and the SKVs need to be compressed into the bit stream. An optimized SKV selection method is proposed such that most LF spatial information can be preserved. To achieve optimum dictionary efficiency, the LF is divided into several coding regions, over which the reconstruction works individually. Experiments and comparisons have been carried out over benchmark LF data set, which show that the proposed SC-SKV codec produces convincing compression results in terms of both rate-distortion performance and visual quality compared with Joint Exploration Model: with 37.9% BD-rate reduction and 1.17-dB BD-PSNR improvement achieved on average, especially with up to 6-dB improvement for low bit rate scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Light Field Compression With Disparity-Guided Sparse Coding Based on Structural Key Views","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2750413","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8071125/08030107.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2750413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8071125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Light Field Compression With Disparity-Guided Sparse Coding Based on Structural Key Views","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8030107/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17303989","pubMedId":"28910766","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CityU Start-up Grant for New Faculty","grantNumber":"7200537/CS"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Light Field Compression With Disparity-Guided Sparse Coding Based on Structural Key Views","sourcePdf":"tip-chau-2750413-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088651S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8071125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8071125","articleId":"8030107","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8030110,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Complexity Science, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/8370013/8030110/chen-2750619-small.gif","p":["Bing Chen received the B.A. degree in mathematics from Liaoning\n University, Shenyang, China, the M.A. degree in mathematics from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, and\n the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1982, 1991, and 1998,\n respectively.","He is currently a Professor with the Institute of Complexity Science, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.

To achieve unprecedented mobile content delivery speeds while reducing backhaul cost and delay, in this paper we propose a new system architecture that combines two recent ideas, distributed caching of content in small cells (FemtoCaching), and, cooperative transmissions from nearby base stations (Coordinated Multi-Point). A key characteristic of the proposed architecture is the interdependence between the caching strategy and the physical layer coordination. Specifically, the caching strategy may cache different content in nearby base stations (BSs) to maximize the cache hit ratio, or cache the same content in multiple nearby BSs such that the corresponding BSs can transmit concurrently, e.g., to multiple users using zero-forcing beamforming, and achieve multiplexing gains. Such interdependency allows a joint cross-layer optimization. Given the popularity distribution of the content, the available cache size, and the network topology, we devise near-optimal strategies of caching such that the system throughput is maximized or the system delay is minimized. Under realistic scenarios and assumptions, our analytical and simulation results show that our system yields significantly faster content delivery, which can be one order of magnitude faster than that of legacy systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/8330738/08030120.pdf","startPage":"1048","endPage":"1061","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2017.2750143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2017.2750143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8330738","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Content Delivery via Distributed Caching and Small Cell Cooperation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Delays","Multiplexing","Microprocessors","Wireless communication","Streaming media","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cache storage","cooperative communication","femtocellular radio","optimisation","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast content delivery","distributed caching","small cell cooperation","mobile video content delivery","wireless devices","Coordinated MultiPoint","caching strategy","physical layer coordination","joint cross-layer optimization","popularity distribution","base stations","cache size","wireless data rates","mobile content delivery speeds","cooperative transmissions","FemtoCaching","cache hit ratio","zero-forcing beamforming","multiplexing gains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous cellular network","caching","coordinated multipoint","diversity","spatial multiplexing"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7755/8330738/8030120-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Fast Content Delivery via Distributed Caching and Small Cell Cooperation","volume":"17","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8030120/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 May 2018","accessionNumber":"17683822","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1444060"},{"fundingName":"Cisco Research Center Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Fast Content Delivery via Distributed Caching and Small Cell Cooperation","sourcePdf":"tmc-ao-2750143-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120193S","chronDate":"May 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"8330738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8330738","articleId":"8030120","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8030121,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/8038917/8030121/li-2734279-small.gif","p":["Yang Li received the B.Eng. degree from the Department of Optical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.

This inspires us to evaluate its applications in analog circuit. In this paper, the evaluation is performed based on the equivalent circuit model and through device- and circuit-level benchmarking against MOSFET counterpart. It is found that the selection of FE thickness is important to balance current amplification and saturated output characteristics. As compared with MOSFET, FeFET exhibits a larger current, transconductance, and current-to-transconductance generation efficiency. Its output resistance is smaller in the linear region and larger in the saturation region. It also has less variation in threshold voltage with temperature. When implementing FeFETs into various analog circuit applications, we find that a node capacitor could be discharged within shorter time to increase circuit speed; A better analog switch consisting of complementary FeFETs exhibits a lower and more linear on-resistance; Differential amplifier provides larger voltage amplification to small input signal; Current mirror transfers a more precise output current to the reference one.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030121/","volume":"64","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8030121/","accessionNumber":"17171509","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Negative Capacitance Ferroelectric MOSFET for Analog Circuit Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Negative Capacitance Ferroelectric MOSFET for Analog Circuit Applications","sourcePdf":"ted-gong-2734279-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104853S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"8038917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8038917","articleId":"8030121","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8030124,"authors":[{"name":"Guojie Hu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Guojie","lastName":"Hu","orcid":"0000-0001-8537-1270","id":"37086101509"},{"name":"Kui Xu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Xu","orcid":"0000-0001-8533-2255","id":"38236981000"},{"name":"Youyun Xu","affiliation":["College of Communications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Youyun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085525390"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8030124","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Multicast communication","Generators","Wireless communication","Complexity theory","Network coding","Quality of service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HDCP data","dual interfaces","adaptive random network coding","full feedback","limited feedback"]}],"abstract":"This letter focuses on the hard deadline constrained prioritized data multicasting scene, in which each user device (UD) that equips with dual wireless interfaces can receive data from the base station and transmit or receive data from near-by UDs simultaneously. In order to maximize the sum throughput, we aim to find the optimal and suboptimal solutions using the backward induction algorithm (BIA) and greedy algorithm (GA) based on full feedback. To decrease the large feedback resources caused by full feedback, we propose a limited feedback strategy, which requires very few channel occupation. We find that the optimal and suboptimal solutions under this limited feedback strategy can also be solved using BIA and GA, but with high complexity. Hence, a heuristic algorithm under this strategy is proposed, which has very low complexity and can keep considerable performance at the same time.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2750155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications

Unfortunately, 1-bit CT\u0394\u03a3Ms are plagued by a host of difficulties. Clock jitter and quantizer metastability are particularly problematic, and the higher loop filter linearity needed to process the full-scale feedback waveform results in increased power dissipation. The use of a finite impulse response (FIR) feedback DAC is a power efficient way of addressing the challenges above. However, even this technique runs into difficulties at multi-GHz clock rates. This paper introduces the idea of time-interleaved (TI) FIR feedback to enhance the performance of a conventional FIR DAC. A single-bit CT\u0394\u03a3M that uses a 2\u00d7 TI-FIR DAC achieves 67.6/68.8/76 dB SNDR/SNR/DR in a 60 MHz bandwidth.

The main challenge of image SR is to recover high-frequency details of a low-resolution (LR) image that are important for human perception. To address this essentially ill-posed problem, we introduce a Deep Edge Guided REcurrent rEsidual (DEGREE) network to progressively recover the high-frequency details. Different from most of the existing methods that aim at predicting high-resolution (HR) images directly, the DEGREE investigates an alternative route to recover the difference between a pair of LR and HR images by recurrent residual learning. DEGREE further augments the SR process with edge-preserving capability, namely the LR image and its edge map can jointly infer the sharp edge details of the HR image during the recurrent recovery process. To speed up its training convergence rate, by-pass connections across the multiple layers of DEGREE are constructed. In addition, we offer an understanding on DEGREE from the view-point of sub-band frequency decomposition on image signal and experimentally demonstrate how the DEGREE can recover different frequency bands separately. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets clearly demonstrate the superiority of DEGREE over the well-established baselines and DEGREE also provides new state-of-the-arts on these data sets. We also present addition experiments for JPEG artifacts reduction to demonstrate the good generality and flexibility of our proposed DEGREE network to handle other image processing tasks.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2750403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8024124/08030140.pdf","startPage":"5895","endPage":"5907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2750403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8024124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Edge Guided Recurrent Residual Learning for Image Super-Resolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030140","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030140/","displayDocTitle":"Deep Edge Guided Recurrent Residual Learning for Image Super-Resolution","volume":"26","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17213551","pubMedId":"28910762","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8030140/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772043"},{"fundingName":"CCF-Tencent Open Research Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Edge Guided Recurrent Residual Learning for Image Super-Resolution","sourcePdf":"tip-liu-2750403-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128436S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8024124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"8024124","articleId":"8030140","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8030148,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Gao","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/8038917/8030148/gao-2742700-small.gif","p":["Rui Gao received the B.Eng. and M Eng. degrees from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

However, its characterization and modeling in nanoscaled devices is a challenge due to their stochastic nature. The objective of this paper is to develop a fast and accurate technique for characterizing the statistical properties of NBTI aging, which can be completed in one day and thus reduce test time significantly. The fast speed comes from replacing the conventional constant voltage stress by the voltage step stress (VSS), while the accuracy comes from capturing the GDs without recovery. The key advances are twofold: first, we demonstrate that this VSS-GD technique is applicable for nanoscaled devices; second, we verify the accuracy of the statistical model based on the parameters extracted from this technique against independently measured data. The proposed method provides an effective solution for GD evaluation, as required when qualifying a CMOS process.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/8038917/08030148.pdf","startPage":"4011","endPage":"4017","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2017.2742700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2017.2742700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038917","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NBTI-Generated Defects in Nanoscaled Devices: Fast Characterization Methodology and Modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","Nanoscale devices","Negative bias temperature instability","Thermal variables control","Voltage measurement","Temperature measurement","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","negative bias temperature instability","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NBTI-generated defects","nanoscaled devices","fast characterization methodology","negative bias temperature instability","VSS-GD technique","statistical properties","NBTI aging","voltage step stress","CMOS process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Defect generation","hole trapping","negative bias tempeture instabilty (NBTI)","variabilty"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"NBTI-Generated Defects in Nanoscaled Devices: Fast Characterization Methodology and Modeling","volume":"64","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8030148/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17171516","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"Newton Research Collaboration Program of the Royal Academy of Engineering","grantNumber":"NRCP1516/4/77"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Science Research Council of U.K.","grantNumber":"EP/L010607/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"NBTI-Generated Defects in Nanoscaled Devices: Fast Characterization Methodology and Modeling","sourcePdf":"ted-ji-2742700-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073828S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"8038917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8038917","articleId":"8030148","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8030206,"authors":[{"name":"P.

For the on-chip training of large-scale deep neural networks using nonvolatile memory (NVM) based synapses, success will require performance levels (e.g., deep neural network classification accuracies) that are competitive with conventional approaches despite the inherent imperfections of such NVM devices, and will also require massively parallel yet low-power read and write access. In this paper, we focus on the latter requirement, and outline the engineering tradeoffs in performing parallel reads and writes to large arrays of NVM devices to implement this acceleration through what is, at least locally, analog computing. We address how the circuit requirements for this new neuromorphic computing approach are somewhat reminiscent of, yet significantly different from, the well-known requirements found in conventional memory applications. We discuss tradeoffs that can influence both the effective acceleration factor (\u201cspeed\u201d) and power requirements of such on-chip learning accelerators.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030206/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2017","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030206/","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"4/5","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Toward on-chip acceleration of the backpropagation algorithm using nonvolatile memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward on-chip acceleration of the backpropagation algorithm using nonvolatile memory","sourcePdf":"jrd-burr-2716579-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078549S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"5288520","isNumber":"8030196","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8030196","articleId":"8030206","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IBM","_value":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8030294,"authors":[{"name":"G.

However, segmentation of the lesion image can be challenging, as these images possess various artifacts distorting the uniformity of the lesion area. Recently, deep convolution learning-based techniques have drawn great attention for pixel-wise image segmentation. These deep networks produce coarse segmentation, and convolutional filters and pooling layers result in segmentation of a skin lesion at a lower resolution than the original skin image. To overcome these drawbacks, we have proposed a superpixel-based fine-tuning strategy to effectively utilize the characteristics of the skin image pixels to accurately extract the border of the lesion. Our proposed approach not only learns a global map for skin lesions, but also acquires the local contextual information, such as lesion boundary. It can, therefore, accurately segment lesions within a given skin image, even in the presence of fuzzy boundaries and complex textures. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, experiments have been conducted using the 2016 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging dataset, and these experiments suggest the effectiveness of the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Skin lesion segmentation using deep convolution networks guided by local unsupervised learning","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/JRD.2017.2708283","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel7/5288520/8030196/08030296.pdf","startPage":"6:1","endPage":"6:8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/JRD.2017.2708283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030196","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030296/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Skin lesion segmentation using deep convolution networks guided by local unsupervised learning","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"4/5","htmlLink":"/document/8030296/","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2017","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Skin lesion segmentation using deep convolution networks guided by local unsupervised learning","sourcePdf":"jrd-bozorgtabar-2708283-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0752S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"5288520","isNumber":"8030196","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8030196","articleId":"8030296","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IBM","_value":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8030297,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This shift introduced a plethora of methods for learning vector representations of sentences, many of them based on compositional methods over word embeddings. These vectors are used as features for subsequent machine learning tasks or for pretraining in the context of deep learning. However, not much is known about the properties that are encoded in these sentence representations and about the language information they encapsulate. Recent studies analyze the encoded representations and the kind of information they capture. In this paper, we analyze results from a previous study on the ability of models to encode basic properties such as content, order, and length. Our analysis led to new insights, such as the effect of word frequency or word distance on the ability to encode content and order.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030297/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2017","volume":"61","issue":"4/5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2017","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030297/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis of sentence embedding models using prediction tasks in natural language processing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CONSENSUS project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission within its FP7 Programme","grantNumber":"611688 and FP7-ICT-10-5.4"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of sentence embedding models using prediction tasks in natural language processing","sourcePdf":"jrd-kermany-2702858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055976S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"5288520","isNumber":"8030196","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8030196","articleId":"8030297","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IBM","_value":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8030298,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Examples of parameters are the number of layers and nodes, the learning rates, and the dropout rates. Typically, these parameters are chosen based on heuristic rules and are manually fine-tuned, which may be very time-consuming, because evaluating the performance of a single parametrization of the NN may require several hours. In this paper, we address the problem of choosing appropriate parameters for the NN by formulating it as a box-constrained mathematical optimization problem and applying a derivative-free optimization tool that automatically and effectively searches the parameter space. The optimization tool employs a radial basis function model of the objective function (the prediction accuracy of the NN) to accelerate the discovery of configurations yielding high accuracy. Candidate configurations explored by the algorithm are trained to a small number of epochs, and only the most promising candidates receive full training. The performance of the proposed methodology is assessed on benchmark sets and in the context of predicting drug\u2013drug interactions, showing promising results. The optimization tool used in this paper is open source.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030298/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"4/5","htmlLink":"/document/8030298/","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An effective algorithm for hyperparameter optimization of neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective algorithm for hyperparameter optimization of neural networks","sourcePdf":"jrd-diaz-2709578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047506S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"5288520","isNumber":"8030196","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8030196","articleId":"8030298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IBM","_value":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8030303,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The signal quality can be degraded due to crowd noise, emotional outbursts, and other sounds from sports play. Different accents from sports players around the world, in combination with different terminologies and slang, cause challenges for ASR systems. The use of our custom online supervised learning method provides a learning mechanism to enable ASR systems to adapt to sporting domains. In this paper, we discuss the results of a novel language model expansion for the 2016 U.S. Open Tennis Championships. Words in the corpora are expanded by \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">hypernyms</i>\n (which provide broader meaning to a target word) and \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">hyponyms</i>\n (which provide specific meaning) of a \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">synset</i>\n, or groups of words that are synonyms. The candidate word is filtered on the basis of relevancy predictors.

Much of the recent progress has been measured in the context of the ImageNet large-scale visual recognition challenge, with a modest subset of 1.2 million images, labeled according to 1,000 concepts of the full ImageNet dataset. Few published results have applied learning to the full ImageNet dataset of 14 million images over nearly 22,000 concepts. This is partly due to the substantial time and computational resources needed to perform adequate training, from such a large dataset, despite exploitation of graphics processing units. To achieve this scale of training, we use Phalanx, a distributed deep learning framework being developed by IBM. Phalanx is a distributed framework with a parameter server as the hub and multiple learners that employ the open source Caffe platform as spokes. Using Phalanx on the full ImageNet dataset, we performed experiments that demonstrate the impact of large-scale learning on multiple training scenarios. This paper includes fine-tuning, where a pretrained model is used as the basis for further training, as well as use of pretrained models for learning deep feature embeddings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2017","volume":"61","issue":"4/5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030315/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed learning of deep feature embeddings for visual recognition tasks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed learning of deep feature embeddings for visual recognition tasks","sourcePdf":"jrd-bhattacharjee-2706118-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064062S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"5288520","isNumber":"8030196","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","xplore-issue":"8030196","articleId":"8030315","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IBM","_value":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8030316,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, Bournemouth University, Poole, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8438339/8030316/jwang-2747400-small.gif","p":["Jing Wang received the B.Eng. degree in electronics and information technology from the Anhui University of Technology, Ma\u2019anshan, China, in 2010, and the M.Sc. degree in multimedia information technology from the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2012.

Given that real-world datasets are often comprised of multiple features or views which describe data from various perspectives, it is important to exploit diversity from multiple views for comprehensive and accurate data representations. Moreover, real-world datasets often come with high-dimensional features, which demands the efficiency of low-dimensional representation learning approaches. To address these needs, we propose a diverse NMF (DiNMF) approach. It enhances the diversity, reduces the redundancy among multiview representations with a novel defined diversity term and enables the learning process in linear execution time. We further propose a locality preserved DiNMF (LP-DiNMF) for more accurate learning, which ensures diversity from multiple views while preserving the local geometry structure of data in each view. Efficient iterative updating algorithms are derived for both DiNMF and LP-DiNMF, along with proofs of convergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methods against the state-of-the-art approaches, proving the advantages of incorporating the proposed diversity term into NMF.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030316/","volume":"48","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8030316/","accessionNumber":"18001108","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"28910783","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Diverse Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Multiview Data Representation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010665","fundingName":"H2020 Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions","grantNumber":"691215"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61702296"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diverse Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Multiview Data Representation","sourcePdf":"tcyb-wang-2747400-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128084S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8438339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8438339","articleId":"8030316","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8030317,"authors":[{"name":"Abbas Kiani","affiliation":["Advanced Networking Laboratory, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8172502/8030317/kiani-2750030-small.gif","p":["Abbas Kiani (S\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran, the M.Sc. degree in communication engineering from Shahed University, Tehran, Iran, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA.","His current research interests include data centers, cloud computing, network optimization, and green communications."]},"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Kiani","id":"37718546700"},{"name":"Nirwan Ansari","affiliation":["Advanced Networking Laboratory, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8172502/8030317/ansar-2750030-small.gif","p":["Nirwan Ansari (S\u201978\u2013M\u201983\u2013SM\u201994\u2013F\u201909) received the B.S.E.E. degree (summa cum laude) from the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Newark, NJ, USA, in 1982, the M.S.E.E. degree from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, in 1983, and the Ph.D. degree from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, in 1988.","He is a Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering with NJIT.

Potential applications include cooperative networks with a large number of simple devices that could be randomly located (e.g., due to mobility). This paper presents the first tractable analytical model for the collective signal strength due to randomly placed transmitters in a 3-D large-scale molecular communication system, either with or without degradation in the propagation environment. Transmitter locations in an unbounded and homogeneous fluid are modeled as a homogeneous Poisson point process. By applying stochastic geometry, analytical expressions are derived for the expected number of molecules absorbed by a fully absorbing receiver or observed by a passive receiver. The bit error probability is derived under ON/OFF keying and either a constant or adaptive decision threshold. Results reveal that the combined signal strength increases proportionately with the transmitter density, and the minimum bit error probability can be improved by introducing molecule degradation. Furthermore, the analysis of the system can be generalized to other receiver designs and other performance characteristics in large-scale molecular communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/TMBMC.2017.2750145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMBMC.2017.2750145","startPage":"118","endPage":"133","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687308/8047728/08030318.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8047728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing Large-Scale Multiuser Molecular Communication via 3-D Stochastic Geometry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing Large-Scale Multiuser Molecular Communication via 3-D Stochastic Geometry","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17260831","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030318/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing Large-Scale Multiuser Molecular Communication via 3-D Stochastic Geometry","sourcePdf":"tmbmc-deng-2750145-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.283997S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6687308","isNumber":"8047728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687308","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8047728","articleId":"8030318","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8030319,"authors":[{"name":"Jiayi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiayi","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0003-2434-4329","id":"37601187300"},{"name":"Xipeng Xue","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xipeng","lastName":"Xue","id":"37086318605"},{"name":"Emil Bj\u00f6rnson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Bj\u00f6rnson","orcid":"0000-0002-5954-434X","id":"37322949300"},{"name":"Bo Ai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Ai","orcid":"0000-0001-6850-0595","id":"37270328400"},{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Jin","id":"37086027447"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8030319","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1023},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030319","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Relays","MIMO","Distortion","Interference","Antennas","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","approximation theory","MIMO communication","radio spectrum management","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output two-way relaying system","single-antenna devices","multipair massive MIMO two-way relaying systems","fixed hardware quality","spectral efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectral efficiency","massive MIMO","two-way relaying","hardware impairments"]}],"abstract":"We consider a multipair massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) two-way relaying system, where multiple pairs of single-antenna devices exchange data with the help of a relay employing a large number of antennas N.

A large-scale approximation of the spectral efficiency with maximum ratio processing is derived in closed form, and the approximation is tight as N \u2192 \u221e. It is revealed that for a fixed hardware quality, the impact of the hardware impairments vanishes asymptotically when N grows large. Moreover, the impact of the impairments may even vanish when the hardware quality is gradually decreased with N, if a scaling law is satisfied.

Energy-efficiency of the miniaturized wireless IoT devices is a key to the cost and convenience factors. While there have been a few prior studies on wireless channel adaptive communication strategies, in this paper we relook at the problem aiming at effectively characterizing the wireless fading channel and devising energy-efficient link-layer retransmission strategy suitable for IoT devices. In particular, we propose a new channel-adaptive strategy that depends on the rate of variation of wireless channel irrespective of the underlying channel fading distribution. We further show that the concept of average fade duration dependent retransmission is a special case of the proposed strategy. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme most effectively characterizes the temporal variations of wireless channel in comparison with the other existing schemes. Performance of the proposed retransmission strategy is compared with the competitive protocols using the Markov model. Numerical results demonstrate that, the proposed scheme offers a gain of about 9% in terms data throughput and about 12% in terms of energy efficiency in comparison to its nearest existing benchmark scheme.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Fading channels","Throughput","Channel estimation","Numerical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fading channel","energy-aware communication","automatic repeat request","high probability analysis","optimal waiting interval","energy-efficiency optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TGCN.2017.2750213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/7511293/8085203/08030325.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGCN.2017.2750213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Temporal Correlation in Wireless Channel for Energy-Efficient Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Temporal Correlation in Wireless Channel for Energy-Efficient Communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030325/","volume":"1","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030325/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ITRA Media Lab Asia Project","grantNumber":"ITRA/15(63)/Mobile/MBSSCRN/01"},{"fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"SB/S3/EECE/0248/2014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Temporal Correlation in Wireless Channel for Energy-Efficient Communication","sourcePdf":"tgcn-de-2750213-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107388S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7511293","isNumber":"8085203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7511293","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8085203","articleId":"8030325","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8030327,"authors":[{"name":"Qinyi Xu","affiliation":["Origin Wireless Inc., Greenbelt, MD, USA","College Park, University of Maryland, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/8302422/8030327/xu-2750201-small.gif","p":["Qinyi Xu (S\u201915) received the B.S.

As the most commonly known waveforming technique for wideband systems, the time-reversal (TR) signal transmission produces a TR resonance by coherently combining multipath energy distributed on virtual antennas, and thus boosts the received signal strength while reducing interference. The wideband waveforming is, in many ways, similar to the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming, where multiple antennas are deployed to imitate a multipath transmission when the bandwidth is limited. In this paper, we provide an overview of recent advances on the wideband waveforming, including massive multipath effect, optimal resource allocation, wireless power transfer and secrecy enhancement for secured communications, and compare with the corresponding counterparts of traditional MIMO beamforming.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2017.2750201","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8302422/08030327.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8302422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2017.2750201","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","startPage":"132","endPage":"149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveforming: An Overview With Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030327","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Waveforming: An Overview With Beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030327/","volume":"20","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8030327/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2018","accessionNumber":"17599745","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveforming: An Overview With Beamforming","sourcePdf":"comst-xu-2750201-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154992S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8302422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8302422","articleId":"8030327","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8030330,"authors":[{"name":"Moslem Nouri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran"],"firstName":"Moslem","lastName":"Nouri","orcid":"0000-0001-9887-028X","id":"37085470031"},{"name":"Maisam Jalilian","affiliation":["Young Researchers and Elite Club, Eslam Abade-E-Gharb Branch, Islamic Azad University, Eslam Abade-E-Gharb, Iran"],"firstName":"Maisam","lastName":"Jalilian","id":"37086248045"},{"name":"Mohsen Hayati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Eslam Abade-E-Gharb, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Hayati","id":"37602311900"},{"name":"Derek Abbott","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Derek","lastName":"Abbott","orcid":"0000-0002-0945-2674","id":"37273382400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8030330","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":606},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030330","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Brain modeling","Integrated circuit modeling","Mathematical model","Data models","Field programmable gate arrays","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","field programmable gate arrays","neural chips","neural nets","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital neuromorphic realization","spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity","synaptic plasticity rules","brain learning","piecewise linear approximations","field-programmable gate array implementation","synaptic weights"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Piecewise linear approximation","field programmable gate array (FPGA)","spiking neural network (SNN)","synaptic learning rule","pair-based spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (PSTDP)","triplet-based spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (TSTDP)"]}],"abstract":"Spike timing dependent plasticity is one of the synaptic plasticity rules that plays a key role in brain learning.

However, an HSI is inevitably contaminated with some unwanted components like noise resulting in spectral distortion, which significantly decreases the performance of postprocessing. In this letter, a deep stage convolutional neural network (CNN) with trainable nonlinearity functions is applied for the first time to remove noise in HSIs. Besides the fact that the weight and bias matrices are learned from cubic training clean-noisy HSI patches, the nonlinearity functions in each stage are also trainable, which differ from the conventional CNN with a fixed nonlinearity function. Compared with the state-of-the-art HSI denoising methods, the experimental results on both synthetic and real HSIs confirm that the proposed method can obtain a more effective and efficient performance.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2017.2743738","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/8082817/08030333.pdf","startPage":"1963","endPage":"1967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2017.2743738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8082817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral Imagery Denoising by Deep Learning With Trainable Nonlinearity Function","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030333/","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Imagery Denoising by Deep Learning With Trainable Nonlinearity Function","volume":"14","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17284804","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8030333/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61222101, 61272120, 61301287, 61301291 and 61350110239"},{"fundingName":"111 project","grantNumber":"B08038"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Province Science and Technology Innovation Team Project","grantNumber":"2013KCT-02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Imagery Denoising by Deep Learning With Trainable Nonlinearity Function","sourcePdf":"lgrs-xie-2743738-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049378S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"8082817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8082817","articleId":"8030333","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8030334,"authors":[{"name":"Samira Ataei","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Samira","lastName":"Ataei","id":"37085756054"},{"name":"James E.

A successful massive MIMO implementation relies on accurate channel estimation, which is typically performed through pilot sequences. However, the channel estimation performance or massive MIMO performance is limited by pilot contamination due to unavoidable reuse of pilot sequences from terminals in neighboring cells. In this paper, a semi-blind decoding method based on independent component analysis (ICA), channel energy levels, and reference bits is proposed. Specifically, the proposed decoding method uses ICA to separate and decode the received signals and to estimate the channels. The estimated channel energy is used to differentiate the in-cell signals and the neighboring cell signals, and reference bits are applied to identify a desired signal among signals within a cell. The analytical performance results of the proposed decoding method are derived. Numerical results show that the proposed semi-blind decoding method has better bit error rate performance and higher transmit efficiency than the traditional minimum mean-square error decoding method and the singular value decomposition-based decoding method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8103134/08030344.pdf","startPage":"7501","endPage":"7511","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2749306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2749306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ICA Based Semi-Blind Decoding Method for a Multicell Multiuser Massive MIMO Uplink System in Rician/Rayleigh Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","MIMO","Channel estimation","Uplink","Fading channels","Principal component analysis","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","decoding","independent component analysis","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","independent component analysis","minimum mean-square error decoding method","singular value decomposition-based decoding method","bit error rate performance","future wireless communications systems","single antenna","massive multiple-input multiple-output system","rician/rayleigh fading channels","multicell multiuser massive MIMO uplink system","ICA based semiblind decoding method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Semi-blind decoding","massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","independent component analysis (ICA)","minimum mean-square error (MMSE)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"ICA Based Semi-Blind Decoding Method for a Multicell Multiuser Massive MIMO Uplink System in Rician/Rayleigh Fading Channels","volume":"16","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8030344/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17372687","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401133 and 61372093"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ICA Based Semi-Blind Decoding Method for a Multicell Multiuser Massive MIMO Uplink System in Rician/Rayleigh Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"twc-shen-2749306-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119828S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8103134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8103134","articleId":"8030344","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8030346,"authors":[{"name":"Shenjie Huang","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communication, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8103134/8030346/huang-2749219-small.gif","p":["Shenjie Huang (S\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree in optoelectronic engineering from Jiangnan University, China, in 2013, and the M.Sc. degree in signal processing and communications from The University of Edinburgh, U.K., in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in digital communications.

However, for certain kind of wideband circuits, the group delay analysis cannot provide a sufficient insight since much of useful information is lost or distorted during the differentiating operation.

It can terminate the decoding procedure after the reencoding step conditionally, which results in the improvement of the serial LCC decoders' speed. The ETA will not degrade the decoding performance of RS codes; on the contrary, it can even improve that of short RS codes remarkably. The simulations of the ETA for (3125) and (255,239) RS codes over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and a (458,410) RS code over the EPR4 channel with 100% AWGN show that it is effective. Moreover, the hardware implementation of the early terminated LCC decoder for (458,410) and (255,239) RS codes is provided. The analysis shows that it can work faster than the previous serial LCC decoder with only a few extra hardware costs. It also shows great advantages in average throughput performance than the common pipelined LCC decoders, especially for relatively high Eb/N0 values, by an overall consideration of the area, speed, and decoding performance.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2746139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8118264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2746139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8118264/08030351.pdf","startPage":"3539","endPage":"3542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Algorithm for Improving the Throughput of Serial Low-Complexity Chase Soft-Decision Reed\u2013Solomon Decoder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"An Algorithm for Improving the Throughput of Serial Low-Complexity Chase Soft-Decision Reed\u2013Solomon Decoder","volume":"25","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8030351/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17390422","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030351/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61474080"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"New Century Excellent Talents in University of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Algorithm for Improving the Throughput of Serial Low-Complexity Chase Soft-Decision Reed\u2013Solomon Decoder","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-luo-2746139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123878S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8118264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8118264","articleId":"8030351","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8030352,"authors":[{"name":"Raed Mesleh","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, German Jordanian University, Amman, Jordan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8103134/8030352/mesle-2749399-small.gif","p":["Raed Mesleh received the Ph.D. degree from Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany, in 2007.

They promise data rate enhancements while maintaining low energy consumption, hardware cost, and computational complexity. As such, they attracted significant research interest in the past few years. One of the major assets of SMTs is the assumption that they can operate with a single RF chain at the transmitter even though multiple antennas might be activated at one time instant. Thus far, this claim is anticipated in several research articles but the transmitter designs of the different SMTs with a single RF chain are not addressed yet in the literature. SMTs include different system configurations, such as spatial modulation, space shift keying, quadrature spatial modulation, and quadrature space shift keying. The required hardware components to implement a transmitter for each of these systems with the minimum number of RF-chains are discussed in this paper. In addition, hardware limitations and the impact of different hardware blocks on the overall system performance are discussed. Besides, a comparison among different schemes along with conventional spatial multiplexing algorithm in terms of power consumption, hardware cost, probability of error, and receiver computational complexity is presented. It is shown that some of these techniques can operate without any RF-chain while a single-RF chain is sufficient for other systems. Moreover, these schemes can be traded off in terms of energy savings, complexity, performance, and cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","volume":"16","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"17372690","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030352/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transmitter Design and Hardware Considerations for Different Space Modulation Techniques","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Deanship of Scientific Research at German Jordanian University","grantNumber":"SIC/2016/42 and SIC/2016/41"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmitter Design and Hardware Considerations for Different Space Modulation Techniques","sourcePdf":"twc-mesleh-2749399-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128001S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8103134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8103134","articleId":"8030352","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8030353,"authors":[{"name":"Shourya Gupta","affiliation":["ECE Department, Bharati Vidyapeeth\u2019s College of Engineering, New Delhi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8118264/8030353/sgupt-2746683-small.gif","p":["Shourya Gupta (S\u201917) was born in New Delhi, India, in 1994.

To impede the read-write conflict of the 6T cell, the seven-transistor (7T) cell with a noise-margin-free read operation has previously been proposed. But it severely lags in terms of its write ability at lower voltages due to its single-ended write operation. Its single-ended read operation also degrades severely in performance when operating in subthreshold (ST) region. To combat these problems, we propose a 7T cell which operates in the ST region down to 0.4 V with improved dynamic write ability. The novel topology also helps reduce power consumption by achieving a lower data retention voltage point. A read assist has been proposed to greatly enhance the performance of the single-ended read operation in ST region. Large improvements in various performance metrics of the proposed cell have been attained while simultaneously achieving a low area of $0.254~\\mu \\text{m}^{2}$ per bit cell on the 32-nm technology node.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2746683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2746683","startPage":"3473","endPage":"3483","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8118264/08030353.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8118264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 32-nm Subthreshold 7T SRAM Bit Cell With Read Assist","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030353/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"A 32-nm Subthreshold 7T SRAM Bit Cell With Read Assist","volume":"25","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","accessionNumber":"17390421","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030353/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 32-nm Subthreshold 7T SRAM Bit Cell With Read Assist","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-gupta-2746683-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060196S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8118264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8118264","articleId":"8030353","onlineDate":"08 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8030362,"authors":[{"name":"Ashok Bindra","bio":{"p":["Ashok Bindra (bindra1@verizon.net) is the editor-in-chief of IEEE Power Electronics Magazine and a veteran freelance writer and editor with more than 35 years of editorial experience covering power electronics, analog/radio-frequency technologies, and semiconductors.

Using grid sabotaging malware, which the cybersecurity firm Dragos called Crash Override and the Slovak antivirus firm ESET called Industroyer, hackers exploited the weakness of the Ukrainian utility's Microsoft Windows machines in its information technology (IT) and communication networks to access the system and control the on/off switching devices of the power transmission lines.

A major step toward greater uptake of these technologies will be the execution of IoT-based large-scale pilots (LSPs) in the entire supply chain. This article outlines the challenges and constraints that an LSP deployment of IoT in this domain must consider. Sectoral and technological challenges are described in order to identify a set of technological and agrifood requirements. An architecture based on a system of systems approach is briefly presented, the importance of addressing the interoperability challenges faced by this sector is highlighted, and we elaborate on requirements for new business models, security, privacy, and data governance. A description of the technologies and solutions involved in designing pilots for four agrifood domains (dairy, fruit, arable, meat and vegetable supply chain) is eventually provided. In conclusion, it is noted that for IoT to be successful in this domain, a significant change of culture is needed.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600528","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8030366/08030481.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IoT in Agriculture: Designing a Europe-Wide Large-Scale Pilot","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030481","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030481/","displayDocTitle":"IoT in Agriculture: Designing a Europe-Wide Large-Scale Pilot","volume":"55","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17169471","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8030481/","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IoT in Agriculture: Designing a Europe-Wide Large-Scale Pilot","sourcePdf":"012ROUSSAKI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047972S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8030366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"8030366","articleId":"8030481","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8030482,"authors":[{"name":"Ferran Adelantado","affiliation":["IN3, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya"],"bio":{"p":["Ferran Adelantado (ferranadelantado@uoe.edu) received his engineering degree in telecommunications (2007) and his Ph.D. degree in telecommunications (2007) from Universitat Politecnico de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain, and his B.Sc. in business sciences (2012) from Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC).

Most of the transmission technologies explicitly designed for IoT and machine-to-machine communication use either an ALOHA-based channel access or some type of Listen Before Talk strategy, based on carrier sensing. In this article, we provide a comparative overview of the uncoordinated channel access methods for Internet of Things technologies, namely ALOHA-based and Listen Before Talk schemes, in relation to the ETSI and FCC regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, we provide a performance comparison of these access schemes, in terms of both successful transmissions and energy efficiency, in a typical Internet of Things deployment. Results show that Listen Before Talk is effective in reducing inter-node interference even for long-range transmissions, although the energy efficiency can be lower than that provided by ALOHA methods. Furthermore, the adoption of rate adaptation schemes lowers the energy consumption while improving the fairness among nodes at different distances from the receiver. Coexistence issues are also investigated, showing that in massive deployments Listen Before Talk is severely affected by the presence of ALOHA devices in the same area.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600617","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8030366/08030484.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030366","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","startPage":"48","endPage":"54","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Uncoordinated Access Schemes for the IoT: Approaches, Regulations, and Performance","volume":"55","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8030484/","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17169470","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncoordinated Access Schemes for the IoT: Approaches, Regulations, and Performance","sourcePdf":"015ZANELLA_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037004S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8030366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8030366","articleId":"8030484","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8030485,"authors":[{"name":"Mahyar Shirvanimoghaddam","affiliation":["University of Sydney"],"bio":{"p":["Mahyar Shirvanimoghaddam [m] (mahyar.shirvanimoghaddam@sydney.edu.au) received his B.Sc. degree with 1st Class Honours from the University of Tehran, Iran, in September 2008, his M.Sc. degree with 1st Class Honours from Sharif University of Technology, Iran, in October 2010, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Sydney, Australia, in January 2015, all in electrical engineering.

On the other hand, the example of Twitter illustrates that very popular products might fail to make money. Both academic researchers and businesses are becoming increasingly aware that we need to reason about the economic and social implications of provided value and privacy in a rigorous, quantitative way.

These issues are caused by key mechanisms being distributed to the IoT network on a large scale, which is why a distributed secure SDN architecture for IoT using the blockchain technique (DistBlockNet) is proposed in this research. It follows the principles required for designing a secure, scalable, and efficient network architecture. The DistBlockNet model of IoT architecture combines the advantages of two emerging technologies: SDN and blockchains technology. In a verifiable manner, blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-confident members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary. A new scheme for updating a flow rule table using a blockchains technique is proposed to securely verify a version of the flow rule table, validate the flow rule table, and download the latest flow rules table for the IoT forwarding devices. In our proposed architecture, security must automatically adapt to the threat landscape, without administrator needs to review and apply thousands of recommendations and opinions manually. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed model architecture and compared it to the existing model with respect to various metrics. The results of our evaluation show that DistBlockNet is capable of detecting attacks in the IoT network in real time with low performance overheads and satisfying the design principles required for the future IoT network.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700041","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8030366/08030491.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"85","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DistBlockNet: A Distributed Blockchains-Based Secure SDN Architecture for IoT Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"DistBlockNet: A Distributed Blockchains-Based Secure SDN Architecture for IoT Networks","volume":"55","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8030491/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17169449","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030491/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DistBlockNet: A Distributed Blockchains-Based Secure SDN Architecture for IoT Networks","sourcePdf":"022PARK_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043821S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8030366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"8030366","articleId":"8030491","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8030492,"authors":[{"name":"Yulong Shen","affiliation":["Xidian University"],"bio":{"p":["Yulong Shen (ylshen@mail.xidian.edu.cn) is a professor at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, China.

Each unstandardized protocol focuses on a specific IoT communication pattern. Inspired by the Internet architecture over which divergent devices can easily be accessed and a considerable number of applications can be run, we propose a generic architecture for IoT. This architecture supports two DIY areas: network DIY for data aggregation and application DIY for service cooperation. To connect these two DIYs, a centralized controller has been designed to provide standardized interfaces for data acquisition, organization, and storage, and to support elastic and supportive computing. With these properties, divergent devices can coexist in a uniform microworld, and rich services can be developed and provided on demand to interoperate with physical devices. This article discusses the background, design principles, and advantages of the proposed architecture, as well as open problems and our initial solution, which substantiates a novel IoT architecture and new research ground.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030492/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","volume":"55","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"17169453","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030492/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"MicroThings: A Generic IoT Architecture for Flexible Data Aggregation and Scalable Service Cooperation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MicroThings: A Generic IoT Architecture for Flexible Data Aggregation and Scalable Service Cooperation","sourcePdf":"023WANG1_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048828S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8030366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8030366","articleId":"8030492","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8030493,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Liu","affiliation":["Central South University"],"bio":{"p":["Xiao Liu received M.Sc. degrees from Central South University, China, in 2017.

In SDN, the purpose is to reduce a large amount of redundant data and response time. We propose a novel Big Data Orchestration as a Service (BDOaaS) as the networking framework, which can dynamically orchestrate big data into services in SDN. In BDOaaS networking, the data center distributes software to all devices in the distributed network, which can orchestrate big data into services in the distributed network; the services- oriented network model is formed. Thus, the network load and response time is reduced. The BDOaaS framework and various components of BDOaaS as well as operation mechanisms are discussed in detail. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed BDOaaS framework. In addition, we discuss a number of challenges in implementing the proposed framework in next generation networks.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700090","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8030366/08030493.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Big Data Orchestration as a Service Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030493/","displayDocTitle":"Big Data Orchestration as a Service Network","volume":"55","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17176571","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8030493/","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Big Data Orchestration as a Service Network","sourcePdf":"024SONG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108516S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8030366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8030366","articleId":"8030493","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8030501,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas F.

Incremental improvements on traditional distributed RANs cannot satisfy these requirements, so the novel and disruptive concept of a cloud RAN (CRAN) has been proposed to decouple digital units (DUs) and radio units (RUs) of base stations (BSs), and centralize DUs into a central office, where virtualization and cloud computing technologies are leveraged to move DUs into the cloud. However, separating RUs and DUs requires low-latency and high-bandwidth connectivity links, called \"fronthaul,\" as opposed to traditional backhaul links. Hence, design of the 5G transport network, that is, the part of the network that carries mobile data traffic between BSs and the core network and data centers, is key to meet the new 5G mobile service requirements and effectively transport the fronthaul traffic. Today, consensus is yet to be achieved on how the fronthaul traffic will be transported between RUs and DUs, and how virtualization of network resources will occur from a radio network segment to the centralized baseband processing units. In this article, we present a new 5G architecture, called virtualized cloud radio access network (V-CRAN), moving toward a cell-less 5G network architecture. We leverage the concept of a virtualized BS (V-BS) that can be optimally formed by exploiting several enabling technologies such as software defined radio (SDR) and coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission/reception. A V-BS can be formed on a per-cell basis or per-user basis by allocating virtualized resources on demand. For the fronthaul solution, our approach exploits the passive optical network (PON), where a wavelength can be dynamically assigned and shared to form a virtualized passive optical network (VPON). Several use cases of the V-CRAN are presented to show how network architecture evolution can enhance system throughput, energy efficiency, and mobility management.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600866","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8030366/08030505.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"209","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtualized Cloud Radio Access Network for 5G Transport","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Virtualized Cloud Radio Access Network for 5G Transport","volume":"55","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8030505/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17169450","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030505/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtualized Cloud Radio Access Network for 5G Transport","sourcePdf":"041WANG2_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059303S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8030366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8030366","articleId":"8030505","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8030545,"authors":[{"name":"Bohao Feng","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University"],"bio":{"p":["Bohao Feng received his B.S. degree from Beijing Jiaotong University in 2011, and is going to receive his Ph.D. degree from the same university in 2017.

However, it is challenging to efficiently build such an integrated network, since terrestrial networks are facing a number of serious problems, and since they do not provide good support for heterogeneous network convergence. In this article, we propose a flexible network architecture, HetNet, for efficient integration of heterogeneous satellite-terrestrial networks. Specifically, the HetNet synthesizes Locator/ID split and Information-Centric Networking to establish a general network architecture. In this way, it is able to achieve heterogeneous network convergence, routing scalability alleviation, mobility support, traffic engineering, and efficient content delivery. Moreover, the HetNet can further improve its network elasticity by using the techniques of Software-Defined Networking and Network Functions Virtualization. In addition, to evaluate the HetNet performance, we build a proof-of-concept prototype system and conduct extensive experiments. The results confirm the feasibility of the HetNet and its advantages.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HetNet: A Flexible Architecture for Heterogeneous Satellite-Terrestrial Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","doi":"10.1109/MNET.2017.1600330","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel7/65/8120228/08030545.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2017.1600330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8120228","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030545/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"November/December  2017","displayDocTitle":"HetNet: A Flexible Architecture for Heterogeneous Satellite-Terrestrial Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8030545/","dateOfInsertion":"27 November 2017","publicationDate":"November/December 2017","accessionNumber":"17394374","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HetNet: A Flexible Architecture for Heterogeneous Satellite-Terrestrial Networks","sourcePdf":"020CHAO_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04477S","chronDate":"November/December  2017","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"8120228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"8120228","articleId":"8030545","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8030546,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Qiu","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Yang Qiu received her B.E. degree in communications engineering from Qiqihar University, Qiqihar, China, in 2010, and the M.E. degree in measurement technology and instruments from Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China, in 2013.

As many passengers are expected to be connected to high-speed Internet, robust and high-capacity direct air-to-ground communication (DA2GC) to connect the aircraft with the ground cellular network is particularly attractive. In this article, we assess the capacity limitations of DA2GC links provided to an aircraft by employing currently available 4G radio technologies. Further, we study different capacity enhancement techniques toward 5G such as an implementation of Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) or coordinated beamsteering to improve DA2GC capacity. We also compare DA2GC performance with connectivity offered by satellites. According to our results, a DA2GC network extended with techniques toward 5G can increase the capacity available per aircraft by nearly 100 Mb/s in comparison with the 4G DA2GC network, assuming 20 MHz bandwidth is exploited. Although the maximum capacity provided by the 5G DA2GC network and satellite communication is the same, satellite communication exhibits only 40 Mb/s for 10000 deployed satellites on average. To motivate future investigation in this field, this article also outlines open challenges and research directions toward more efficient DA2GC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Study on Seamless DA2GC for Aircraft Passengers toward 5G","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700188","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8114510/08030548.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8114510","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030548/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance Study on Seamless DA2GC for Aircraft Passengers toward 5G","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8030548/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17371889","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Study on Seamless DA2GC for Aircraft Passengers toward 5G","sourcePdf":"041VONDRA_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053704S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8114510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8114510","articleId":"8030548","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8030569,"authors":[{"name":"Nhan Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Connecticut"],"firstName":"Nhan","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37085543761"},{"name":"Mohammad Maifi Hasan Khan","affiliation":["University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, US"],"firstName":"Mohammad Maifi Hasan","lastName":"Khan","id":"37086166758"},{"name":"Yusuf Albayram","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Connecticut"],"firstName":"Yusuf","lastName":"Albayram","id":"37085528672"},{"name":"Kewen Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Connecticut"],"firstName":"Kewen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085697584"},{"name":"Swapna Gokhale","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Connecticut"],"firstName":"Swapna","lastName":"Gokhale","id":"37265938600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1993-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1992-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1994-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"8030569","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"abstract":"In large-scale data stream management systems, sampling rate of different sensors can change quickly in response to changed execution environment. However, such changes can cause significant load imbalance on the back-end servers, leading towards performance degradation and data loss. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present a model-driven middleware service (i.e., Arion) that uses a two-step approach to minimize data loss. Specifically, Arion constructs models and algorithms for overload prediction for heterogeneous systems (where different streams can have different sampling rates and message sizes) leveraging limited execution traces from homogeneous systems (where each stream has the same sampling rate and message size). Subsequently, when an overload condition is predicted (or detected), Arion first leverages the a priori constructed models to identify the streams (if any) that can be split into multiple substreams to scale up the performance and minimize data loss without allocating additional servers. If the software based solution turns out to be inadequate, in the second stage, the system allocates additional servers and redirects streams to stabilize the system leveraging the models. Extensive evaluation on a 6 node cluster using Apache Cassandra for various scenarios shows that our approach can predict the potential overload condition with high accuracy (81.9%) while minimizing data loss and the number of additional servers significantly.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Servers","Data models","Middleware","Monitoring","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["middleware","minimisation","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stream data storage","large-scale data stream management systems","Arion constructs models","message size","sampling rates","data loss minimisation","model-driven middleware service","heterogeneous systems","6 node cluster","Apache Cassandra"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cassandra","Data Stream Management","Middleware"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2017.14","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8029867/8030554/08030569.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2017.14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arion: A Model-Driven Middleware for Minimizing Data Loss in Stream Data Storage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Arion: A Model-Driven Middleware for Minimizing Data Loss in Stream Data Storage","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030569/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030569/","accessionNumber":"17188774","conferenceDate":"25-30 June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 June 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arion: A Model-Driven Middleware for Minimizing Data Loss in Stream Data Storage","confLoc":"Honololu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1993a034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127156S","chronDate":"25-30 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8029867","isNumber":"8030554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8029867","xplore-issue":"8030554","articleId":"8030569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8030580,"authors":[{"name":"Chungheon Yi","affiliation":["Department of Communication and Information, Inha University, Incheon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Chungheon","lastName":"Yi","id":"37086154567"},{"name":"Wonik Choi","affiliation":["Department of Communication and Information, Inha University, Incheon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Wonik","lastName":"Choi","id":"37678343700"},{"name":"Ling Liu","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280776600"},{"name":"Youngjun Jeon","affiliation":["Dawul Geoinfo Co, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Youngjun","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37086150249"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1993-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1992-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1994-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"8030580","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"abstract":"This paper presents a cloud-based positioning method that leverages visualized signal images through visual analytics and deep learning. At a mobile client, such as a smart phone, this approach transforms multidimensional signals captured at a known location and at a given time into a signal image and transmits such visual signal images to the Cloud. By collecting and storing many such visual signal images as fingerprints, we can build a visual signal image cloud and produce a signal image map for the geographical region of interest and utilize such signal image map to serve the positioning requests of mobile clients on the move. When a user Alice wants to know her current position, her mobile client will generate a signal image from the multiple signals it receives with timestamp and send this query image to a Cloud server. The server searches the existing signal images stored in the cloud to find those that are similar to this query signal image and estimates the positioning of Alice based on the locations of those similar signal images collected by the server. We evaluate our visual signal images based positioning system on the entire two floors of a large department store and on the street and shops outside the department store, with the signal images collected over 30 minutes before serving positioning queries. The mean error of up to 4 meters is observed. To further verify the applicability of the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted to distinguish whether a user is indoor or outdoor by applying a deep learning algorithm with 60% of signal images collected for training and 40% signal images for testing.

So, the challenge to the HPC system designers is providing not only high performance but also high performance at lower cost. For high performance yet cost effective cyberinfrastructure, we propose a new system model augmenting Amdahl's second law for balanced system to optimize price-performance-ratio. We express the optimal balance among CPU-speed, I/O-bandwidth and DRAM-size (i.e., Amdahl's I/O-and memory-number) in terms of application characteristics and hardware cost. Considering Xeon processor and recent hardware prices, we showed that a system needs almost 0.17GBPS I/O-bandwidth and 3GB DRAM per GHz CPU-speed to minimize the price-performance-ratio for data-and compute-intensive applications. To substantiate our claim, we evaluate three different cluster architectures: 1) SupermikeII, a traditional HPC cluster, 2) SwatIII, a regular datacenter, and 3) CeresII, a MicroBrick-based novel hyperscale system. CeresII with 6-Xeon-D1541 cores (2GHz/core), 1-NVMe SSD (2GBPS I/O-bandwidth) and 64GB DRAM per node, closely resembles the optimum produced by our model. Consequently, in terms of price-performance-ratio CeresII outperformed both SupermikeII (by 65-85%) and SwatIII (by 40-50%) for data-and compute-intensive Hadoop benchmarks (TeraSort and WordCount) and our own benchmark genome assembler based on Hadoop and Giraph.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2017.27","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8029867/8030554/08030583.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"154","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2017.27","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Augmenting Amdahl's Second Law: A Theoretical Model to Build Cost-Effective Balanced HPC Infrastructure for Data-Driven Science","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Augmenting Amdahl's Second Law: A Theoretical Model to Build Cost-Effective Balanced HPC Infrastructure for Data-Driven Science","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030583/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17188866","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030583/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Augmenting Amdahl's Second Law: A Theoretical Model to Build Cost-Effective Balanced HPC Infrastructure for Data-Driven Science","confLoc":"Honololu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1993a147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1943S","chronDate":"25-30 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8029867","isNumber":"8030554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8029867","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8030554","articleId":"8030583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8030593,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Jing Meng","affiliation":["IBM Research-China, Beijing, P.R.

Every anomalous behavior potentially causes incidents, especially some unaware and/or unknown issues, which severely harm their SLA (Service Level Agreement). Existing solutions generally monitor cloud platform at different layers and then detect anomalies based on rules or learning algorithms on monitoring metrics. However, complexity of nowadays cloud platforms, high dynamics of cloud workloads and thousands of various types of metrics make anomalous behavior detection more challenging to be applied in production, especially in large scale cloud production environments. In this paper, we present a practical cloud anomalous behavior detection system called DriftInsight. It firstly analyzes multi-denominational metrics of each component and identifies a set of representative steady components based on the convergences of their states. Then it generates a state model and a state transit model for each steady cloud component. Finally, it detects behavior anomalies of these steady components in near real-time and meanwhile evolve behavior models on the fly. The evaluation results of this approach in a commercial large-scale PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) cloud are demonstrated its capability and efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8029867/8030554/08030593.pdf","startPage":"230","endPage":"237","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2017.37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2017.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030554","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DriftInsight: Detecting Anomalous Behaviors in Large-Scale Cloud Platform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Cloud computing","Production","Anomaly detection","Monitoring","Complexity theory","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","contracts","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DriftInsight","steady cloud component","behavior anomalies","Platform-as-a-Service","large-scale cloud Platform","Service Level Agreement","large scale cloud production environments","cloud anomalous behavior detection system","multidenominational metrics","state model","state transit model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","behavior model","anomaly detection","unsupervised clustering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"DriftInsight: Detecting Anomalous Behaviors in Large-Scale Cloud Platform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8030593/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17188848","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","conferenceDate":"25-30 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DriftInsight: Detecting Anomalous Behaviors in Large-Scale Cloud Platform","confLoc":"Honololu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1993a230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068953S","chronDate":"25-30 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8029867","isNumber":"8030554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8029867","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8030554","articleId":"8030593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8030595,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Yang","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yang","id":"38244270500"},{"name":"Bo Liu","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086154811"},{"name":"Jiannong Cao","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Jiannong","lastName":"Cao","id":"37277630700"},{"name":"Yuvraj Sahni","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yuvraj","lastName":"Sahni","id":"37085813493"},{"name":"Zhenyu Wang","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"38184058600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1993-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1992-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1994-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"8030595","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":998},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030595","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Mobile communication","Bandwidth","Resource management","Mobile handsets","Servers","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing","resource allocation","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile edge cloud","wireless access bandwidth","multidimensional search and adjust","application latency","computation resources","latency sensitive applications","resource allocation problem","joint computation partitioning","mobile device","mobile gaming","mobile applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["computation partitioning","latency sensitive applications","mobile edge cloud"]}],"abstract":"The proliferation of mobile devices and ubiquitous access of the wireless network enables many new mobile applications such as augmented reality, mobile gaming and so on. As the applications are latency sensitive, researchers propose to off load the complex computations of these applications to the nearby mobile edge cloud, in order to reduce the latency. Existing works mostly consider the problem of partitioning the computations between the mobile device and the traditional cloud that has abundant resources. The proposed approaches can not be applied in the context of mobile edge cloud, because both the resources in the mobile edge cloud and the wireless access bandwidth to the edge cloud are constrained. In this paper, we study joint computation partitioning and resource allocation problem for latency sensitive applications in mobile edge clouds. The problem is novel in that we combine the computation partitioning and the two-dimensional resource allocations in both the computation resources and the network bandwidth. We develop a new and efficient method, namely Multi-Dimensional Search and Adjust (MDSA), to solve the problem. We compares MDSA with the classic list scheduling method and the Search Adjust algorithm via comprehensive simulations. The results show that MDSA outperforms the benchmark algorithms in terms of the overall application latency.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2017.39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2017.39","startPage":"246","endPage":"253","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud

Among the various adversarial attacks, MITC (Man in the Cloud) attack on commercial cloud storage applications has emerged as a critical threat because it is easy to launch and hard to detect. In this paper, we propose MITC Defender, a hardware-based defense system capable of protecting client user credentials using Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and preventing against four different types of MITC attack in cloud environment. By adopting Intel SGX security features such as sealing and attestation, MITC Defender can securely seal user credentials locally and easily unseal user credentials, when verifications are needed, in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). We implement MITC Defender on an open source platform OpenSGX and evaluate the performance and potential overhead. Our evaluation results show that MITC Defender is effective on defense against MITC attack and other security threats with a low cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030602/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17188842","htmlLink":"/document/8030602/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","conferenceDate":"25-30 June 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Man in the Cloud (MITC) Defender: SGX-Based User Credential Protection for Synchronization Applications in Cloud Computing Platform","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Man in the Cloud (MITC) Defender: SGX-Based User Credential Protection for Synchronization Applications in Cloud Computing Platform","confLoc":"Honololu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1993a302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091297S","chronDate":"25-30 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8029867","isNumber":"8030554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8029867","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8030554","articleId":"8030602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":8030620,"authors":[{"name":"Tong Jia","affiliation":["Peking University"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Jia","id":"37086021624"},{"name":"Lin Yang","affiliation":["IBM Research"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085444478"},{"name":"Pengfei Chen","affiliation":["IBM Research"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086150566"},{"name":"Ying Li","affiliation":["Peking University"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Li","id":"37061360300"},{"name":"Fanjing Meng","affiliation":["IBM Research"],"firstName":"Fanjing","lastName":"Meng","id":"37722776400"},{"name":"Jingmin Xu","affiliation":["IBM Research"],"firstName":"Jingmin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37597892000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1993-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1992-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1994-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"8030620","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":790},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Production","Flow graphs","Data mining","Yarn","Heart beat","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data mining","multi-threading","security of data","system monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly diagnosis","execution anomalies","cloud systems","execution logs","troubleshooting","problem diagnosis","automatic anomaly detection","anomaly alerts","operational logs","transaction flow","IBM public cloud production platform","simulated systems","TCFG mining","LogSed","time-weighted control flow graph mining","healthy execution","lab environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["interleaved logs","time-weighted control flow graph mining","Anomaly diagnosis"]}],"abstract":"Detecting execution anomalies is very important to monitoring and maintenance of cloud systems. People often use execution logs for troubleshooting and problem diagnosis, which is time consuming and error-prone. There is great demand for automatic anomaly detection based on logs. In this paper, we mine a time-weighted control flow graph (TCFG) that captures healthy execution flows of each component in cloud, and automatically raise anomaly alerts on observing deviations from TCFG. We outlined three challenges that are solved in this paper, including how to deal with the interleaving of multiple threads in logs, how to identify operational logs that do not contain any transactional information, and how to split the border of each transaction flow in the TCFG. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by leveraging logs from an IBM public cloud production platform and two simulated systems in the lab environment. The evaluation results show that our TCFG mining and anomaly diagnosis both perform over 80% precision and recall on average.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2017.64","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8029867/8030554/08030620.pdf","startPage":"447","endPage":"455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2017.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LogSed: Anomaly Diagnosis through Mining Time-Weighted Control Flow Graph in Logs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030620/","displayDocTitle":"LogSed: Anomaly Diagnosis through Mining Time-Weighted Control Flow Graph in Logs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17188795","htmlLink":"/document/8030620/","conferenceDate":"25-30 June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LogSed: Anomaly Diagnosis through Mining Time-Weighted Control Flow Graph in Logs","confLoc":"Honololu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1993a447.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081916S","chronDate":"25-30 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8029867","isNumber":"8030554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8029867","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8030554","articleId":"8030620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8030623,"authors":[{"name":"Yahya Al-Dhuraibi","firstName":"Yahya","lastName":"Al-Dhuraibi"},{"name":"Fawaz Paraiso","affiliation":["Inria/University of Lille"],"firstName":"Fawaz","lastName":"Paraiso","id":"37086029960"},{"name":"Nabil Djarallah","affiliation":["Scalair"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Djarallah","id":"37086017928"},{"name":"Philippe Merle","affiliation":["Inria/University of Lille"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Merle","id":"37086021339"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1993-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1992-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1994-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"8030623","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1920},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Elasticity","Containers","Cloud computing","Linux","Monitoring","Measurement","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application end-users","horizontal elasticity","Kubernetes elasticity","autonomic vertical elasticity","Docker containers","computing resources","application workload","virtual machines","packaging","IBM's autonomic computing MAPE-K principles","ELASTICDOCKER scales","hosting machine","vertical elasticity","cloud computing","resource utilization","quality of experience","migration performance metrics","live migration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","Vertical elasticity","Container","Docker","Live migration"]}],"abstract":"Elasticity is the key feature of cloud computing to scale computing resources according to application workloads timely. In the literature as well as in industrial products, much attention was given to the elasticity of virtual machines, but much less to the elasticity of containers. However, containers are the new trend for packaging and deploying microservices-based applications. Moreover, most of approaches focus on horizontal elasticity, fewer works address vertical elasticity. In this paper, we propose ELASTICDOCKER, the first system powering vertical elasticity of Docker containers autonomously. Based on the well-known IBM's autonomic computing MAPE-K principles, ELASTICDOCKER scales up and down both CPU and memory assigned to each container according to the application workload. As vertical elasticity is limited to the host machine capacity, ELASTICDOCKER does container live migration when there is no enough resources on the hosting machine. Our experiments show that ELASTICDOCKER helps to reduce expenses for container customers, make better resource utilization for container providers, and improve Quality of Experience for application end-users. In addition, based on the observed migration performance metrics, the experiments reveal a high efficient live migration technique. As compared to horizontal elasticity, ELASTICDOCKER outperforms Kubernetes elasticity by 37.63%.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2017.67","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8029867/8030554/08030623.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2017.67","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030554","startPage":"472","endPage":"479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomic Vertical Elasticity of Docker Containers with ELASTICDOCKER","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Autonomic Vertical Elasticity of Docker Containers with ELASTICDOCKER","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030623/","conferenceDate":"25-30 June 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17188853","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030623/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomic Vertical Elasticity of Docker Containers with ELASTICDOCKER","confLoc":"Honololu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1993a472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074019S","chronDate":"25-30 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8029867","isNumber":"8030554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8029867","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8030554","articleId":"8030623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8030632,"authors":[{"name":"Nickolas Allen Davis","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, New Mexico Tech, Socorro, New Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Nickolas Allen","lastName":"Davis","id":"37085852339"},{"name":"Abdelmounaam Rezgui","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, New Mexico Tech, Socorro, New Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Abdelmounaam","lastName":"Rezgui","id":"37671544600"},{"name":"Hamdy Soliman","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, New Mexico Tech, Socorro, New Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Hamdy","lastName":"Soliman","id":"37276704700"},{"name":"Skyler Manzanares","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, New Mexico Tech, Socorro, New Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Skyler","lastName":"Manzanares","id":"37086151237"},{"name":"Milagre Coates","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, New Mexico Tech, Socorro, New Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Milagre","lastName":"Coates","id":"37086157014"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1993-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1992-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1994-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"8030632","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":453},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030632","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Hardware","Data models","Predictive models","Training","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","digital simulation","failure analysis","neural nets","pattern classification","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware failures","cloud data centers","neural network","cloud providers","cloud users","failure prediction","performance information","variable length windowing vector","conservative host failure behavior models","FailureSim","CloudSim","aggregation methods","trained classification algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Failure prediction","Cloud","Simulation","Neural networks","Machine learning","FailureSim","CloudSim","Dynamic CloudSim"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2017.75","pdfPath":"/iel7/8029867/8030554/08030632.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","startPage":"544","endPage":"551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2017.75","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FailureSim: A System for Predicting Hardware Failures in Cloud Data Centers Using Neural Networks","abstract":"Hardware failures in cloud data centers may cause substantial losses to cloud providers and cloud users. Therefore, the ability to accurately predict when failures occur is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present FailureSim, a simulator based on CloudSim that supports failure prediction. FailureSim obtains performance related information from the cloud and classifies the status of the hardware using a neural network. Performance information is read from hosting hardware and stored in a variable length windowing vector. At specified stages, various aggregation methods are applied to the windowing vector to obtain a single vector that is fed as input to the trained classification algorithm. Using conservative host failure behavior models, FailureSim was able to successfully predict host failure in the cloud with roughly 89% accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030632/","accessionNumber":"17188855","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8030632/","publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","conferenceDate":"25-30 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"FailureSim: A System for Predicting Hardware Failures in Cloud Data Centers Using Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FailureSim: A System for Predicting Hardware Failures in Cloud Data Centers Using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Honololu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1993a544.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091005S","chronDate":"25-30 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8029867","isNumber":"8030554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8029867","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8030554","articleId":"8030632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8030638,"authors":[{"name":"Vincenzo Scoca","affiliation":["IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, Italy"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Scoca","id":"37086127563"},{"name":"Rafael Brundo Uriarte","affiliation":["IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, Italy"],"firstName":"Rafael Brundo","lastName":"Uriarte","id":"38230631300"},{"name":"Rocco De Nicola","affiliation":["IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, Italy"],"firstName":"Rocco","lastName":"De Nicola","id":"37370570100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1993-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1992-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1994-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"8030638","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1024},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Contract Negotiation in Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8029867/8030554/08030638.pdf","startPage":"592","endPage":"599","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2017.81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030554","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2017.81","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Contracts","Cloud computing","Syntactics","Runtime","Diamond","Companies","Semantics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","contracts","formal languages","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart contract negotiation","contracts","transaction protocol","formal language"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Smart Contracts","Negotiation","Cloud Computing","Service Level Agreement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030638","abstract":"A smart contract is the formalisation of an agreement, whose terms are automatically enforced by relying on a transaction protocol, while minimising the need of intermediaries. Such contracts not only specify the service and its quality but also the possible changes at runtime of the terms of agreement. Although smart contracts provide a great deal of flexibility, analysing their compatibility and reaching agreements with this level of dynamism is considerably more challenging, due to the freedom of clients and providers in formulating needs/offers. We introduce a formal language to specify interactions between offers and requests and present a methodology for the autonomous negotiation of smart contracts, which analyses the cost and the necessary changes for reaching an agreement. Moreover, we describe a set of experiments that provides insights on the relative cost of dynamism in negotiating smart contracts and compare the request/offer matching rates of our solution with related works.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030638/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17188871","htmlLink":"/document/8030638/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","conferenceDate":"25-30 June 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Smart Contract Negotiation in Cloud Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Contract Negotiation in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Honololu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1993a592.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100788S","chronDate":"25-30 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8029867","isNumber":"8030554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8029867","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8030554","articleId":"8030638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8030640,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086079057"},{"name":"Changlong Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Changlong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085370072"},{"name":"Hang Zhuang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Zhuang","id":"37085354075"},{"name":"Jiali Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Jiali","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086076640"},{"name":"Qingfeng Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Qingfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086080550"},{"name":"Xuehai Zhou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xuehai","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085340896"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1993-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1992-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1994-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"8030640","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":335},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030640","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Sparks","Heuristic algorithms","Cloud computing","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","bioinformatics","biology computing","computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","data analysis","dynamic programming","parallel algorithms","parallel processing","parallel programming","proteins","shared memory systems","very large databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient distributed Smith-Waterman algorithm","Apache Spark","SIMD instructions","621 times speedup","optimal local alignment","pairwise sequences","Single-Instruction Multiple-Data instructions","recent next-generation sequencing machines","sequence alignment algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distrubuted Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm","SIMD instructions","Apache Spark","Scalability","Alluxio","HDFS"]}],"abstract":"The Smith-Waterman algorithm, which produces the optimal local alignment between pairwise sequences, is universally used as a key component in bioinformatics fields.

However, the current data placement strategies in these frameworks lack in consideration of the types of storage devices and the features of surveillance video tasks.So using the current distributed computing framework for large-scale video processing in the cloud computing cluster with hybrid storage architecture will lead to the low utilization of the high-performance devices and the skew of the video task completion time. In this paper, we propose a novel Two-Stage Data Distribution Approach (TSDDA) for optimizing the data placement in the cloud computing platform. Our approach adopts an accurate Processing Time Prediction Model(PTPM) to estimate the processing time of the video task by incorporating the several important video task features, the heterogeneous I/O capabilities and processing abilities in the hybrid cluster. In our approach, an initial data placement algorithm is used to place the data needed by the video processing jobs on the appropriate processing nodes in the process of the initial data loading, and then a dynamic data migration algorithm is further used to migrate the video data from HDD to SSD for further improving the SSD's utilization and the processing efficiency during the process of the job execution. Finally, we conduct the extensive experiments, and the experimental results verify the accuracy of PTPM and show that the proposed TSDDA outperforms the current methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 June 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","conferenceDate":"25-30 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030641/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17188780","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Two-Stage Data Distribution for Distributed Surveillance Video Processing with Hybrid Storage Architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Stage Data Distribution for Distributed Surveillance Video Processing with Hybrid Storage Architecture","confLoc":"Honololu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1993a616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060887S","chronDate":"25-30 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8029867","isNumber":"8030554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8029867","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8030554","articleId":"8030641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8030642,"authors":[{"name":"Jaehun Lee","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, Hanyang Univ, Korea"],"firstName":"Jaehun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085504232"},{"name":"Hochul Lee","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, Hanyang Univ, Korea"],"firstName":"Hochul","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086026106"},{"name":"Young Choon Lee","affiliation":["Dept. of Computing, Macquarie Univ, Australia"],"firstName":"Young Choon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085618907"},{"name":"Hyuck Han","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, Dongduk Women's Univ, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyuck","lastName":"Han","id":"37085609805"},{"name":"Sooyong Kang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, Hanyang Univ, Korea"],"firstName":"Sooyong","lastName":"Kang","id":"37653573000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1993-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1992-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1994-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"8030642","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":658},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collaboration","Mobile communication","Mobile handsets","Hardware","Cloud computing","Androids","Humanoid robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile collaborative applications","hardware resources","software resources","multimedia contents","multiple heterogeneous mobile devices","collaboration scenarios","platform-level collaboration","platform support","mobile edge computing","computing resources","collaboration possibilities","feature-rich mobile devices","traditional video conferencing","multidevice resource sharing","mobile collaborative application development","application level","platform-level solution","media content sharing","cloud-based software","CollaboRoid","Android stack"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile collaboration","edge computing","resource sharing","cloud computing","Android"]}],"abstract":"Computing resources including mobile devices at the edge of a network are increasingly connected and capable of collaboratively processing what's believed to be too complex to them. Collaboration possibilities with today's feature-rich mobile devices go far beyond simple media content sharing, traditional video conferencing and cloud-based software as a services. The realization of these possibilities for mobile edge computing (MEC) requires non-trivial amounts of efforts in enabling multi-device resource sharing. The current practice of mobile collaborative application development remains largely at the application level. In this paper, we present CollaboRoid, a platform-level solution that provides a set of system services for mobile collaboration. CollaboRoid's platform-level design significantly eases the development of mobile collaborative applications promoting MEC. In particular, it abstracts the sharing of not only hardware resources, but also software resources and multimedia contents between multiple heterogeneous mobile devices. We implement CollaboRoid in the application framework layer of the Android stack and evaluate it with several collaboration scenarios on Nexus 5 and 7 devices. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the platform-level collaboration using CollaboRoid in terms of the latency and energy consumption.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2017.84","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8029867/8030554/08030642.pdf","startPage":"624","endPage":"631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2017.84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030554","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Platform Support for Mobile Edge Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030642/","displayDocTitle":"Platform Support for Mobile Edge Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8030642/","publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","conferenceDate":"25-30 June 2017","accessionNumber":"17188844","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Platform Support for Mobile Edge Computing","confLoc":"Honololu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1993a624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065411S","chronDate":"25-30 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8029867","isNumber":"8030554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8029867","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8030554","articleId":"8030642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8030648,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Abdelsalam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Institute for Cyber Security"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Abdelsalam","id":"37088220192"},{"name":"Ram Krishnan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering"],"firstName":"Ram","lastName":"Krishnan","id":"37666690700"},{"name":"Ravi Sandhu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Ravi","lastName":"Sandhu","id":"37266854300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1993-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1992-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1994-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"8030648","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":531},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Monitoring","Anomaly detection","Security","Random access memory","Clustering algorithms","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","invasive software","pattern clustering","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security monitoring","open-source cloud IaaS software","clustering-based IaaS cloud monitoring","infrastructure as a service","virtualized IT infrastructure","datacenter","malicious behavior","sequential k-means clustering","anomaly detection","OpenStack","malware","virtual assets","virtual machines","virtual resources","cloud providers","cloud services","malicious tasks","resource utilization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Cloud IaaS","Insider Threat","Malware","Ransomware"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030648","abstract":"Organizations increasingly utilize cloud services such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) where virtualized IT infrastructure are offered on demand by cloud providers. A major challenge for cloud providers is the security of virtual resources provided to its customers. In particular, a key concern is whether, for example, virtual machines (VMs) in the datacenter are performing tasks that are not expected of those machines. Given the scale of datacenters, continuous security monitoring of the virtual assets is essential to detect unexpected (and potentially malicious) behavior. In this paper, we develop a continuous monitoring framework for cloud IaaS. The proposed framework uses a modified version of sequential K-means clustering algorithm for anomaly detection based on variations in resource utilization that can be observed when cloud insiders or malware perform malicious tasks on cloud customers' VMs. Our approach assumes no prior knowledge of the installed applications on the VMs. Finally, our experiments are performed on data collected from our OpenStack (a popular open-source cloud IaaS software) testbed based on a standard 3-tier web architecture with the ability to scale-out (i.e., multiple copies of the server are spawned) and scale-back (i.e., the number of copies are reduced) on demand. The experiments are based on real-world as well as synthetically injected anomalies.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2017.90","pdfPath":"/iel7/8029867/8030554/08030648.pdf","startPage":"672","endPage":"679","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2017.90","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering-Based IaaS Cloud Monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Clustering-Based IaaS Cloud Monitoring","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17188773","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030648/","conferenceDate":"25-30 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering-Based IaaS Cloud Monitoring","confLoc":"Honololu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1993a672.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051385S","chronDate":"25-30 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8029867","isNumber":"8030554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8029867","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8030554","articleId":"8030648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8030657,"authors":[{"name":"Tessema Mengistu","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, Carbondale, Illinois, USA"],"firstName":"Tessema","lastName":"Mengistu","id":"37086157374"},{"name":"Abdulrahman Alahmadi","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, Carbondale, Illinois, USA"],"firstName":"Abdulrahman","lastName":"Alahmadi","id":"37085458866"},{"name":"Abdullah Albuali","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, Carbondale, Illinois, USA"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Albuali","id":"37086151034"},{"name":"Yousef Alsenani","affiliation":["Dept. of Comput.

In addition to the huge number of dedicated servers deployed in data centers, there are billions of underutilized Personal Computers (PCs), usually used only for a few hours per day, owned by individuals and organizations worldwide. The vast untapped compute and storage capacities of the underutilized PCs can be consolidated as alternative cloud fabrics to provision broad cloud services, primarily infrastructure as a service. This approach, thus referred to as \"no data center\" approach, complements the data center based cloud provision model. In this paper, we present our opportunistic Cloud Computing system, called cuCloud, that runs on scavenged resources of underutilized PCs within an organization/community. Our system demonstrates that the \"no data center\" solution indeed works. Besides proving our concept, model, and philosophy, our experimental results are highly encouraging.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2017.99","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8029867/8030554/08030657.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2017.99","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030554","startPage":"714","endPage":"717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A \"No Data Center\" Solution to Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A \"No Data Center\" Solution to Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030657/","conferenceDate":"25-30 June 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17188775","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030657/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A \"No Data Center\" Solution to Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Honololu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1993a714.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045657S","chronDate":"25-30 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8029867","isNumber":"8030554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8029867","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8030554","articleId":"8030657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8030663,"authors":[{"name":"Guodong Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Georgia"],"firstName":"Guodong","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085584988"},{"name":"Yue Yin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Georgia"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Yin","id":"37085990700"},{"name":"Ruoyan Cai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Georgia"],"firstName":"Ruoyan","lastName":"Cai","id":"37085993689"},{"name":"Kang Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Georgia"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"Li","id":"37277622200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1993-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1992-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1994-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"8030663","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":860},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Virtualization","Virtual machine monitors","Cloud computing","Security","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","operating systems (computers)","program debugging","security of data","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detection framework","virtualization implementations","virtualization specific vulnerabilities","cloud computing","multiple operating systems","virtualization vulnerabilities","domain knowledge","software vulnerabilities","virtual machine","bug finding tools","software implementation","symbolic execution techniques","bugs detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","virtualization","vulnerability","symbolic execution"]}],"abstract":"As the enabling technology, virtualization plays an important role in cloud computing by providing the capability of running multiple operating systems and applications on top of the same underlying hardware. Early detection of vulnerability in virtualization is vital for virtualization performance and to protect against attacks that may lead to information leak or virtual machine(VM) escape. While current bug finding tools can detect common flaws in software implementation, many of the virtualization vulnerabilities are unique to cloud platform and can hardly be addressed by existing techniques. The discovery of these vulnerabilities often requires specific domain knowledge and a significant amount of manual effort. In this paper, we conducted analyses of known vulnerabilities disclosed in recent years in different virtualization platforms, studied the differences between vulnerabilities in virtualization and traditional software vulnerabilities and categorized them into different groups. Based on the analyses, we propose to detect these vulnerabilities by extending symbolic execution techniques and designed a detection framework for virtualization platforms which can detect bugs in virtualization implementations.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2017.105","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8029867/8030554/08030663.pdf","startPage":"743","endPage":"748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2017.105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Virtualization Specific Vulnerabilities in Cloud Computing Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030663/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Virtualization Specific Vulnerabilities in Cloud Computing Environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17188789","htmlLink":"/document/8030663/","conferenceDate":"25-30 June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Virtualization Specific Vulnerabilities in Cloud Computing Environment","confLoc":"Honololu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1993a743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044657S","chronDate":"25-30 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8029867","isNumber":"8030554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8029867","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8030554","articleId":"8030663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8030668,"authors":[{"name":"Hyeong-Jin Kim","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Engineering, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Hyeong-Jin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085747971"},{"name":"Hyeong-Il Kim","affiliation":["1st Missile Systems PMO, Agency for Defense Development, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Hyeong-Il","lastName":"Kim","id":"37578661900"},{"name":"Jae-Woo Chang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Eng, Jeonju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Woo","lastName":"Chang","id":"37367367600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1993-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1992-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1994-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"8030668","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1316},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Cloud computing","Classification algorithms","Data privacy","Databases","Protocols","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","data privacy","database management systems","pattern classification","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy-preserving kNN classification algorithm","cloud computing","privacy-preserving database outsourcing","data privacy","query privacy","encrypted databases","data access patterns","encrypted index scheme","class label","Yao garbled circuit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Database outsourcing","Data privacy","Query protection","Hiding data access pattern","kNN classification algorithm","Cloud computing"]}],"abstract":"With the prevalence of cloud computing, privacy-preserving database outsourcing has been spotlighted. To preserve both data privacy and query privacy from adversaries, databases need to be encrypted before being outsourced to the cloud. However, there exists the only kNN classification scheme over the encrypted databases in the cloud. Because the existing scheme suffers from high computation overhead, we proposed a secure and efficient kNN classification algorithm that conceals the resulting class label and data access patterns.

However, due to its multi-stage execution model and high interactive complexity across nodes, it is nontrivial to understand how/why a specific setting influences the execution flow and performance. To address this challenge, we develop an execution model-driven framework that extracts key performance metrics relevant to different levels of execution (e.g., application level, stage level, task level, system level) and applies statistical analysis techniques to identify the key execution features that change significantly in response to changes in configuration settings. This allows users to answer questions such as \"How does configuration setting X affect the execution behavior of Spark?\" or \"Why does changing configuration setting X degrade the performance of Spark application Y?\". We tested our framework using 6 open source applications (e.g., Word Count, Tera Sort, KMeans, Matrix Factorization, PageRank, and Triangle Count) and demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework in identifying the underlying reasons behind changes in performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2017.119","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8029867/8030554/08030677.pdf","startPage":"802","endPage":"807","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2017.119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding the Influence of Configuration Settings: An Execution Model-Driven Framework for Apache Spark Platform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Understanding the Influence of Configuration Settings: An Execution Model-Driven Framework for Apache Spark Platform","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030677/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17188826","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030677/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the Influence of Configuration Settings: An Execution Model-Driven Framework for Apache Spark Platform","confLoc":"Honololu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1993a802.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073001S","chronDate":"25-30 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8029867","isNumber":"8030554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8029867","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8030554","articleId":"8030677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8030687,"authors":[{"name":"Jianping Li","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jianping Li","id":"37087429558"},{"name":"Zhenguo Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhenguo Wang","id":"37087306110"},{"name":"Junli Deng","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Junli Deng","id":"37087646334"},{"name":"Yuning Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yuning Zhang","id":"37087918202"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6252-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6251-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6250-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6253-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8030687","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"abstract":"Sphere decoding (SD) is an efficient algorithm for Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) digital communications. It has been showed to achieve near Maximum Likelihood (ML) performance with low complexity. However, the complexity of conventional SD algorithm is high under the specific environment. The performance and the computation complexity of SD algorithm is highly dependent on the initial choice of sphere radius. Thus, it is important to design a proper initial radius scheme for SD which improve the performance and reduce the computation complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme base on the knowledge of statistical probability and the constellation energy to design a new initial radius scheme. The performance and algorithmic efficiency of this scheme are increased by application of a factor constellation energy E. The simulation results show under the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) condition. The proposed scheme can achieve the aim that save more operation time than the conventional SD algorithm. At the same time, the performance gap compared to conventional SD algorithm can be restricted to a certain level.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","MIMO","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational complexity","Lattices","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["initial radius selection","sphere decoding","Multiple-input Multiple-output digital communications","MIMO digital communications","maximum likelihood performance","computation complexity","statistical probability","constellation energy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["initial radius selection","constellation energy","sphere decoding","MIMO"]}],"doi":"10.1109/OPTIP.2017.8030687","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Opto-Electronic Information Processing (ICOIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Opto-Electronic Information Processing (ICOIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8023733/8030681/08030687.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIP.2017.8030687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved scheme of initial radius selection in SD algorithm under the low SNR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An improved scheme of initial radius selection in SD algorithm under the low SNR","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030687/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030687/","accessionNumber":"17173416","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved scheme of initial radius selection in SD algorithm under the low SNR","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"2-01_IP003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06345S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8023733","isNumber":"8030681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8023733","xplore-issue":"8030681","articleId":"8030687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8030689,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Zeeshan","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering (CEME), National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Zeeshan","id":"37331829200"},{"name":"Muhammad Waqas Khan","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering (CEME), National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Waqas","lastName":"Khan","id":"37086149963"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6252-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6251-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6250-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6253-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8030689","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Adaptive equalizers","Adaptive systems","Fading channels","Receivers","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive equalisers","code division multiple access","computational complexity","correlation methods","fading channels","least mean squares methods","multipath channels","multiuser channels","radiofrequency interference","signal detection","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive equalization","wireless communication networks","multiuser interference","MUI","channel effects","code division multiple access","hybrid direct sequence time hopped CDMA systems","hybrid DS-TH CDMA system","state-space recursive least squares","adaptive memory","SSRLSWAM","noncoherent detection","multipath fading effects","computational complexity","BER performance","correlating detector","minimum mean square error","MMSE detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","adaptive equalization","SSRLS","DS-TH CDMA"]}],"abstract":"Modern wireless communication networks need to support a variety of data intensive applications in various medium/channel scenarios. It requires high network throughput as well as robustness against Multiuser Interference (MUI), multipath fading and other channel effects. This is achieved by using the hybrid Direct Sequence Time Hopped CDMA (DS-TH CDMA) systems. In this paper, a novel usage of State-Space Recursive Least Squares with Adaptive Memory (SSRLSWAM) with non-coherent detection is proposed for adaptive equalization of DS-TH CDMA system. The proposed algorithm is able to mitigate multipath fading effects through adaptive equalization by effectively initializing the SSRLSWAM and tuning its forgetting factor. The choice to use non-coherent detection is made because of the fact that non-coherent detectors do not utilize the phase information at the receiver side, resulting in lowering computational complexity. The BER performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the correlating detector and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) detector. It is shown that SSRLSWAM results in BER performance better than both the correlating and MMSE.","doi":"10.1109/OPTIP.2017.8030689","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Opto-Electronic Information Processing (ICOIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Opto-Electronic Information Processing (ICOIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8023733/8030681/08030689.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIP.2017.8030689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive equalization in hybrid DS-TH CDMA system using State-Space RLS with Adaptive Memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030689/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive equalization in hybrid DS-TH CDMA system using State-Space RLS with Adaptive Memory","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17173399","htmlLink":"/document/8030689/","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive equalization in hybrid DS-TH CDMA system using State-Space RLS with Adaptive Memory","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"2-03_IP018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048596S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8023733","isNumber":"8030681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8023733","xplore-issue":"8030681","articleId":"8030689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8030754,"authors":[{"name":"Yangyang Wang","affiliation":["School of Reliability and Systems Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yangyang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086156933"},{"name":"Minghong Han","affiliation":["School of Reliability and Systems Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Minghong","lastName":"Han","id":"37064929500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0918-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0919-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8030754","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":286},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pareto optimization","Design optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Linear programming","Joining processes","Reliability engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design engineering","evolutionary computation","genetic algorithms","large-scale systems","Pareto optimisation","particle swarm optimisation","quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intricate problems","multiobjective optimization problem","multiple coupled sub-problems","ATC method","system-level sub-problem","single-objective optimization problems","particle swarm optimization method","multiobjective problems","multiobjective multidisciplinary design optimization","analysis target cascade system","MOPSO method","sequence quadratic programming method","SQP method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multidisciplinary design optimization","analysis target cascade","multi - objective optimization","particle swarm optimization algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030754","abstract":"Complex systems consist of many disciplines or components, which are often difficult to the design optimize as a overall. They need to be broken down into different components, and then coordinate the links between different parts. ATC (Analysis Target Cascade) - one of the multidisciplinary design optimization methods, is an effective way to solve such intricate problems. In the traditional multidisciplinary design optimization methods, there is only one objective function. But the multi-objective optimization problems are often emerged in practical engineering problems. So, we will focus on the multi-objective optimization problems in multidisciplinary design optimization, and solve them with particle swarm optimization. The original problem is firstly decomposed into multiple coupled sub-problems and then coordinate the relation between each sub-problems by ATC method. The system-level sub-problem is a multi-objective optimization problem and the other subsystems are the general single-objective optimization problems, the MOPSO method and the sequence quadratic programming (SQP) method will be used to solve them respectively. The final optimization result is consistent with the optimization result before the original problem is decomposed. Finally, we used two examples to demonstrate the feasibility of particle swarm optimization (PSO) method to get the solution of the multi-objective problems with ATC method.","doi":"10.1109/ICRSE.2017.8030754","pdfPath":"/iel7/8024047/8030549/08030754.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Second International Conference on Reliability Systems Engineering (ICRSE)","publicationTitle":"2017 Second International Conference on Reliability Systems Engineering (ICRSE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRSE.2017.8030754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on multi-objective multidisciplinary design optimization based on particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Research on multi-objective multidisciplinary design optimization based on particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17173490","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030754/","conferenceDate":"10-12 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on multi-objective multidisciplinary design optimization based on particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"R064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057611S","chronDate":"10-12 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8024047","isNumber":"8030549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8024047","xplore-issue":"8030549","articleId":"8030754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8030826,"authors":[{"name":"Bing-Fei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Bing-Fei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37275267600"},{"name":"Po-Wei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Wei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086029332"},{"name":"Tsong-Yang Tsou","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsong-Yang","lastName":"Tsou","id":"37086029752"},{"name":"Tzu-Min Lin","affiliation":["Division of Rheumatology, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzu-Min","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086019695"},{"name":"Meng-Liang Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Meng-Liang","lastName":"Chung","id":"37086021797"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3422-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-3421-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3423-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-0925"}],"articleNumber":"8030826","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":445},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Continuous wavelet transforms","Entropy","Stress","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","medical signal processing","signal denoising","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote-PPG","previous work","optimal signal extraction","webcam","robust signal extraction methods","optic models","frequency analysis","CWT","signal reconstruction","motion/illuminance induced residual noise","continuous wavelet transform","Camera-based Heart Rate measurement","highly dynamic residual noise reduction","FFT","improved SNR ratio","entropy","stationary conditions","motion conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Continuous wavelet transform","photoplethysmography","biomedical monitoring","remote sensing"]}],"abstract":"Recent years have seen increased attention being given to measure Heart Rate with remote-PPG.

There are many problems need to be considered in anomaly-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS), such as ability to adapt to dynamic network environments, unavailability of labeled data, false positive rate. This paper, we use Deep learning techniques to implement an anomaly-based NIDS. These techniques show the sensitive power of generative models with good classification, capabilities to deduce part of its knowledge from incomplete data and the adaptability. Our experiments with KDDCup99 network traffic connections show that our work is effective to exact detect in anomaly-based NIDS and classify intrusions into five groups with the accuracy based on network data sources.","doi":"10.1109/ICSSE.2017.8030867","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on System Science and Engineering (ICSSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on System Science and Engineering (ICSSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8024255/8030818/08030867.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSSE.2017.8030867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8030818","startPage":"210","endPage":"214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An anomaly-based network intrusion detection system using Deep learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An anomaly-based network intrusion detection system using Deep learning","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030867/","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17188307","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8030867/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An anomaly-based network intrusion detection system using Deep learning","confLoc":"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"P43-ICSSE2017-XPL.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043862S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8024255","isNumber":"8030818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8024255","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8030818","articleId":"8030867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8030870,"authors":[{"name":"Duong Nguyen-Ngoc Tran","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Duong Nguyen-Ngoc","lastName":"Tran","id":"37086014079"},{"name":"Long Hoang Pham","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Long Hoang","lastName":"Pham","id":"37085387698"},{"name":"Ha Manh Tran","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Ha Manh","lastName":"Tran","id":"38254716100"},{"name":"Synh Viet-Uyen Ha","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Synh Viet-Uyen","lastName":"Ha","id":"37085348830"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3422-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-3421-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3423-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-0925"}],"articleNumber":"8030870","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030870","abstract":"In the traffic surveillance system (TSS), there are many factors affect the qualities of the result. Through practical application, it is difficult to determine which scene changing during the day period, from the daylight to nighttime, the conversion of the sunny and overcast, wet and dry scene. However, there have been no controlled studies which illustrate the method to distinguish environment scene, which is the one of six main challenges in TSS. Therefore, this paper presents the method to detect and recognize the change of scene during all-day surveillance; Thus, TSS adopt the recognition to determine the appropriate method for each scene, for increasing performance. Our recognition model is based on the combination of the CIE-Lab color space and the histogram of the region-of-interest (ROI) in each frame, which used for extracting the feature for the Feed Forward Neural Network to perform the detection.

Thus, VLSI architecture is a promising candidate in implementing neural network models nowadays. Backpropagation algorithm is used for training multilayer perceptron with high degree of parallel processing. Parallel computing implementation is the best suitable on FPGA or ASIC. The on-chip back-propagation learning algorithm design is proposed to implement 2\u00d72\u00d71 neural network architecture on FPGA. The simulation results show that back-propagation learning algorithm is converged in 3 epochs with error target as small as 0.05.

However, the cutoff frequency of this LC filter also limits the control bandwidth as well as increases the order of the CS-APF current control loop. This issue combining with the inevitable time delay in the DSP-based controller applied to the CS-APF make the actual compensating current always significantly lagged behind the reference current, resulting in the severe degrade of the CS-APF performance.

With the use of higher bands and increased access point density, terrestrial wireless communication systems are encountering more and more line-of-sight conditions than systems of earlier era. Moreover modern era of communication systems is generally designed to adapt transmission parameters dynamically. Such adaptations are done based on estimation of channel statistics. The measure of line-of-sight (Rician K-factor) is one of such statistics. It plays a vital role in estimating fade statistics, which influences the bit error rate, spectral efficiency, level crossing rate, average fade duration and so on. These factors significantly influence design of communication systems. This paper focuses on analytical computation of Rician K-factor of multi-clustered propagation channel models including antenna gain-patterns. Rician K-factor in different wireless channel models, which are based on the indoor channel model given by Saleh and Valenzuela and the channel model for IEEE 802.11ad standard have been calculated and compared with simulations. We show that, channel model provided explicit Rician factor does not agree with actual K-factor experienced by a link when details such as directivity of clusters and antenna gains are considered. The difference results in erroneous estimate of system performance. It is seen that the estimates of the required signal to noise ratio per bit for a given modulation and coding schemes can be affected by as much as 4 dB in sub 6 GHz systems and as high as 5 dB for millimeter wave systems due to incorrect use of Rician K-factor for relevant links. Average channel capacity is affected by around 13% for high SNR links due to variation of Rician K-factor.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2750722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2750722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08030982.pdf","startPage":"19194","endPage":"19212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Calculation of Rician K-Factor for Indoor Wireless Channel Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Calculation of Rician K-Factor for Indoor Wireless Channel Models","volume":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8030982/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17266483","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030982/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Analytical Calculation of Rician K-Factor for Indoor Wireless Channel Models","sourcePdf":"access-mukherjee-2750722-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115948S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8030982","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8030983,"authors":[{"name":"Kuanping Shang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kuanping","lastName":"Shang","id":"37070828500"},{"name":"Shibnath Pathak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shibnath","lastName":"Pathak","id":"38020109600"},{"name":"Chuan Qin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Qin","id":"38245249400"},{"name":"S.

However, obtaining good performance for memoryintensive algorithms, which often exchange large data arrays with external DRAM, still requires timeconsuming optimization and good knowledge of hardware design. This article proposes a new design methodology, based on dedicated applicationand data array-specific caches. These caches provide most of the benefits that can be achieved by coding optimized DMA-like transfer strategies by hand into the HPC application code, but require only limited manual tuning (basically the selection of architecture and size), are neutral to target HLS tool and technology (FPGA or ASIC), and do not require changes to application code. We show experimental results obtained on five common memory-intensive algorithms from very diverse domains, namely machine learning, data sorting, and computer vision. We test the cost and performance of our caches against both out-of-the-box code originally optimized for a GPU, and manually optimized implementations specifically targeted for FPGAs via HLS. The implementation using our caches achieved an 8X speedup and 2X energy reduction on average with respect to out-of-the-box models using only simple directive-based optimizations (e.g., pipelining). They also achieved comparable performance with much less design effort when compared with the versions that were manually optimized to achieve efficient memory transfers specifically for an FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2750923","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08030985.pdf","startPage":"18953","endPage":"18974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2750923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acceleration by Inline Cache for Memory-Intensive Algorithms on FPGA via High-Level Synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030985/","displayDocTitle":"Acceleration by Inline Cache for Memory-Intensive Algorithms on FPGA via High-Level Synthesis","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8030985/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17266484","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Xilinx Inc."},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission through the ECOSCALE Project","grantNumber":"H2020-ICT-671632"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Acceleration by Inline Cache for Memory-Intensive Algorithms on FPGA via High-Level Synthesis","sourcePdf":"access-ma-2750923-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103929S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8030985","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8030997,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Ren","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8030997/ren-2749515-small.gif","p":["Jie Ren received the B.S. degree from the Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2011 and the M.S. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2014.

To improve the reception reliability of destinations with poor channel conditions, we first divide destinations in the network into two types: Type I and Type II. Type I destinations refer to the destinations with capability of successful information decoding and energy harvesting, which serve as relays to help other destinations. Type II destinations have poor connections to the source and hence compete to obtain help from Type I destinations. Accordingly, cooperative relaying strategies for the two types of destinations are proposed on the basis of coalition formation game. First, we propose to utilize the dynamic programming (DP) approach to obtain the optimal coalition structure in the network, though at the cost of heavy time and storage complexity. Then, two distributed hedonic coalition formation (DHCF) approaches are developed to generate coalition structures, which are more efficient than the DP approach. Simulation results show that all proposed approaches outperform the non-cooperative one (i.e., direct link transmission). The results also illustrate that the DP approach achieves the largest data rate and lowest outage probability for destinations, and the DHCF approaches achieve near-to-optimal performance.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08030997.pdf","startPage":"17644","endPage":"17659","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2749515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2749515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coalition Formation Approaches for Cooperative Networks With SWIPT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030997/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Coalition Formation Approaches for Cooperative Networks With SWIPT","htmlLink":"/document/8030997/","publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","accessionNumber":"17246470","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"volume":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61471022 and 61573037"},{"fundingName":"Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation","grantNumber":"151061"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/L025272/1"},{"fundingName":"H2020-MSCA-RISE-2015","grantNumber":"690750"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Coalition Formation Approaches for Cooperative Networks With SWIPT","sourcePdf":"access-ren-2749515-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147662S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8030997","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8030999,"authors":[{"name":"Zahid Akhtar","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8030999/akhta-2750918-small.gif","p":["Zahid Akhtar received the Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from the University of Cagliari, Italy.

It plays a crucial role in shaping audio-visual processing, compression, transmission and systems, along with their implementation, optimization, and testing. Service providers are enacting different quality of service (QoS) solutions to issue the best quality of experience (QoE) to their customers. Thus, devising precise perception-based quality metrics will greatly help improving multimedia services over wired and wireless networks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the works that have been carried out over recent decades in perceptual audio, video, and joint audio-visual quality assessments, describing existing methodologies in terms of requirement of a reference signal, feature extraction, feature mapping, and classification schemes. In this context, an overview of quality formation and perception, QoS, QoE as well as quality of perception is also presented. Finally, open issues and challenges in audio-visual quality assessment are highlighted and potential future research directions are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2750918","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08030999.pdf","startPage":"21090","endPage":"21117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2750918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Audio-Visual Multimedia Quality Assessment: A Comprehensive Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8030999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Audio-Visual Multimedia Quality Assessment: A Comprehensive Survey","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8030999/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17515785","htmlLink":"/document/8030999/","volume":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Audio-Visual Multimedia Quality Assessment: A Comprehensive Survey","sourcePdf":"access-akhtar-2750918-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.300126S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8030999","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8031004,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Chang","affiliation":["University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4"],"bio":{"p":["Zheng Chang [M] (zheng.chang@jyu.fi) received the B.Eng. degree from Jilin University, Changchun, China in 2007, the M.Sc.

The benefits of using CMC for content distribution or distributed computing from social networking perspectives have been studied earlier. In this article, we first present the concepts of CMC and then discuss the energy-efficiency benefits from the system-level point-of-view as well as open challenges in designing a green CMC. Moreover, we investigate the problem of forming mobile clouds for the purpose of content distribution and energy-efficiency. Specifically, given a group of users interested in downloading the same content from an operator, an energy-aware based user selection and scheduling algorithm is proposed. Simulation examples show that a significant energy-saving performance can be achieved without depleting the battery of any user equipment by the proposed scheme. Also, the research potential is discussed in the context of CMC.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/8352607/08031004.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"192","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2017.1600170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2017.1600170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8352607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collaborative Mobile Clouds: An Energy Efficient Paradigm for Content Sharing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031004/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Collaborative Mobile Clouds: An Energy Efficient Paradigm for Content Sharing","htmlLink":"/document/8031004/","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2018","accessionNumber":"17736847","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaborative Mobile Clouds: An Energy Efficient Paradigm for Content Sharing","sourcePdf":"032CHANG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073084S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"8352607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8352607","articleId":"8031004","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8031014,"authors":[{"name":"Chaoqiong Fan","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8387695/8031014/fan-2750801-small.gif","p":["Chaoqiong Fan received the Bachelor's degree in communication\n engineering from China University of Petroleum, Shandong, China, in 2015.

Most of the existing works only allow temporal-domain access and admit at most one user at each time slot, resulting in significant underutilization of spectrum resource, which will be less attractive to mm-wave UDN applications. A generalized temporal-spatial sharing scheme is proposed in this paper for UDN by exploiting the location information of incumbent devices, where multiple users are allowed to access each channel simultaneously via spatial separations. For distributed applications, the global information exchange among secondary users (SU) tends to be impractical, given the unaffordable signaling overhead and latency. Thus, a noncooperative game with fine-grained two-dimensional reuse is formulated, which leads to a more efficient access strategy. It is then proved to be an ordinary potential game (OPG), which guarantees the existence of the strategy Nash equilibrium (NE). Finally, an improved decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm is designed, with which SUs can learn from wireless environments and adapt toward an NE point, relying on the individual observation and the historical action reward (rather than the global information exchanging). The convergence efficiency of the new scheme is also rigorously proved. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the performances of the proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2750801","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8387695/08031014.pdf","startPage":"4954","endPage":"4968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2750801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning-Based Spectrum Sharing and Spatial Reuse in mm-Wave Ultradense Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031014/","displayDocTitle":"Learning-Based Spectrum Sharing and Spatial Reuse in mm-Wave Ultradense Networks","volume":"67","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17840070","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8031014/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning-Based Spectrum Sharing and Spatial Reuse in mm-Wave Ultradense Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-li-2750801-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097224S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8387695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8387695","articleId":"8031014","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8031020,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Leu","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/8196978/8031020/leu-2735861-small.gif","p":["Adrian Leu received the Ph.D. degree in computer vision and robotics\n from the University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany, in 2014.","He was a Technical Manager for the EU FP7 project CORBYS, responsible for the development and implementation of the\n cognitive robot control architecture and system integration.

The harvester is able to drive along an asparagus dam in the field, detect asparagus stalks, identify stalks that are ready for harvesting, and perform harvesting without damaging. These system abilities are enabled by a novel vision perception module and a novel harvesting mechanism. The perception module is based on three-dimensional-point cloud processing, and it is able to reliably and robustly detect the asparagus stalks, their positions, and dimensions. A novelty of the proposed harvesting mechanism is a multi-tools solution to increase harvesting productivity. The results of the first outdoor field tests demonstrate the applicability of the presented robotic harvester.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031020/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","volume":"22","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"17447006","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8031020/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robotic Green Asparagus Selective Harvesting","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Commission as part of the GARotics experiment of the ECHORD++","grantNumber":"601116"},{"fundingName":"FP7-SME-2012 AmLight","grantNumber":"304556"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Robotic Green Asparagus Selective Harvesting","sourcePdf":"tmech-risticdurrant-2735861-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10633S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"8196978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8196978","articleId":"8031020","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8031025,"authors":[{"name":"Slobodan N.

The voltage disturbances are commonly suppressed by enhancing the controller with an inner active resistance feedback. In cases where the switching noise and parasitic oscillations introduce sampling errors, conventional sampling is replaced by the oversampling-based error-free feedback acquisition which derives the average of the measured currents over the past switching period. The time delay introduced into the feedback path creates difficulties in designing the current controller with the active resistance. In this paper, we introduce a novel structure of the current controller, which includes the error-free sampling and the active resistance feedback. Devised structure improves the disturbance rejection by extending the range of permissible values of the active resistance. Controller structure is based on the internal model principles, and it maintains the input step response unaffected. This paper comprises analytical design, the gain setting procedure, computer simulation, and experimental results obtained from an experimental setup with a three-phase inverter, digital controller, and a permanent-magnet synchronous motor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031025/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","volume":"65","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","accessionNumber":"17447561","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8031025/","displayDocTitle":"Digital Current Controller With Error-Free Feedback Acquisition and Active Resistance","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Digital Current Controller With Error-Free Feedback Acquisition and Active Resistance","sourcePdf":"tie-levi-2745476-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071921S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8214929","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8214929","articleId":"8031025","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":8031026,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng-Guang Wu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Institute of Cyber-Systems and Control, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8466048/8031026/zwu-2744671-small.gif","p":["Zheng-Guang Wu was born in 1982.

A novel distributed event-triggered communication protocol based on state estimates of neighboring agents is proposed to solve the consensus problem of the leader-following systems. We first investigate the consensus problem in a fixed topology, and then extend to the switching topologies. State estimates in fixed topology are only updated when the trigger condition is satisfied. However, state estimates in switching topologies are renewed with two cases: 1) the communication topology is switched or 2) the trigger condition is satisfied. Clearly, compared to continuous-time interaction, this protocol can greatly reduce the communication load of multiagent networks. Besides, the event-triggering function is constructed based on the local information and a new event-triggered rule is given. Moreover, \u201cZeno behavior\u201d can be excluded. Finally, we give two examples to validate the feasibility and efficiency of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2017.2744671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2017.2744671","startPage":"1736","endPage":"1746","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/8466048/08031026.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8466048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-Triggered Control for Consensus of Multiagent Systems With Fixed/Switching Topologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031026/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Event-Triggered Control for Consensus of Multiagent Systems With Fixed/Switching Topologies","volume":"48","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2018","accessionNumber":"18079738","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8031026/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61603102 and 61673339"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"R1100716 and LR16F030001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005153","fundingName":"China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists","grantNumber":"61425009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-Triggered Control for Consensus of Multiagent Systems With Fixed/Switching Topologies","sourcePdf":"tsmc-xu-2744671-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118884S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8466048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"8466048","articleId":"8031026","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8031030,"authors":[{"name":"Felip Riera-Palou","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, University of the Balearic Islands, Mallorca, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8290782/8031030/riera-2750922-small.gif","p":["Felip Riera-Palou (SM\u201911) received the B.S./M.S. degree in\n computer engineering from the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB), Mallorca, Spain, in 1997, the M.Sc. and Ph.D.\n degrees in communication engineering from the University of Bradford, Bradford, U.K., in 1998 and 2002, respectively,\n and the M.Sc. degree in statistics from the University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K., in 2006.

To this end, the network is partitioned into clusters, each comprising a small number of base stations that share data and/or control information and thus are able to apply cluster-wide cooperative multiple-antenna techniques such as network MIMO (N-MIMO) or large-scale MIMO (LS-MIMO). In contrast to previous works whose main goal was the study of purely physical layer metrics, the framework proposed here serves to evaluate the network performance in terms of operator-relevant metrics such as the average user throughput, the average delay, or different fairness indices. The cross-layer design introduced here is general enough to encompass various forms of power allocation or scheduling policies while being able to incorporate per-cluster or per-base power constraints. Remarkably, different greedy algorithms are introduced for both N-MIMO and LS-MIMO that effectively exploit the multiuser and frequency diversity of the system while remaining computationally feasible. A particularly interesting application of the proposed framework, explored in detail in this paper, is a thorough and realistic comparison of the performance of N-MIMO and LS-MIMO that reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each strategy in terms of different performance metrics.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8290782/08031030.pdf","startPage":"1202","endPage":"1216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2750922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2750922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8290782","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cluster-Based Cooperative MIMO-OFDMA Cellular Networks: Scheduling and Resource Allocation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Resource management","Measurement","Optimization","5G mobile communication","Computer architecture","Scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cooperative communication","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","telecommunication scheduling","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDMA cellular networks","resource allocation","wideband wireless cellular systems","cluster-wide cooperative multiple-antenna techniques","N-MIMO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA cellular networks","large-scale MIMO","network MIMO","resource allocation","scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Cluster-Based Cooperative MIMO-OFDMA Cellular Networks: Scheduling and Resource Allocation","volume":"67","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8031030/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17577977","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008530","fundingName":"European Regional Development Fund","grantNumber":"TEC2014-59255-C3-2-R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster-Based Cooperative MIMO-OFDMA Cellular Networks: Scheduling and Resource Allocation","sourcePdf":"tvt-rierapalou-2750922-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117241S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8290782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8290782","articleId":"8031030","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8031035,"authors":[{"name":"Georges El Rahi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8595470/8031035/rahi-2750706-small.gif","p":["Georges El Rahi received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from the Lebanese American University, Byblos, Lebanon, and the M.S. degree from the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech in 2017, with thesis entitled Demand-Side Energy Management in the Smart Grid: Games and Prospects.

The problem is formulated as a single-leader, multiple-follower Stackelberg game between the power company and multiple prosumers. In this game, the power company acts as a leader who determines the pricing strategy that maximizes its profits, while the prosumers act as followers who react by choosing the amount of energy to buy or sell so as to optimize their current and future profits. The proposed game accounts for each prosumer's subjective decision when faced with the uncertainty of profits, induced by the random future price. In particular, the framing effect, from the framework of prospect theory (PT), is used to account for each prosumer's valuation of its gains and losses with respect to an individual utility reference point. The reference point changes between prosumers and stems from their past experience and future aspirations of profits. The followers' noncooperative game is shown to admit a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) under classical game theory which is obtained using a fully distributed algorithm. The results are extended to account for the case of PT using algorithmic solutions that can achieve an NE under certain conditions. Simulation results show that the total grid load varies significantly with the prosumers' reference point and their loss-aversion level. In addition, it is shown that the power company's profits considerably decrease when it fails to account for the prosumers' subjective perceptions under PT.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2017.2750706","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8595470/08031035.pdf","startPage":"702","endPage":"713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8595470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2017.2750706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Managing Price Uncertainty in Prosumer-Centric Energy Trading: A Prospect-Theoretic Stackelberg Game Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031035","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5165411/8595470/8031035-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Managing Price Uncertainty in Prosumer-Centric Energy Trading: A Prospect-Theoretic Stackelberg Game Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031035/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18365274","htmlLink":"/document/8031035/","volume":"10","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1549894, ACI-1541105, ECCS-1549881, CNS-1446621 and ECCS 1549900"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Managing Price Uncertainty in Prosumer-Centric Energy Trading: A Prospect-Theoretic Stackelberg Game Approach","sourcePdf":"tsg-etesami-2750706-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105499S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8595470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"8595470","articleId":"8031035","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8031038,"authors":[{"name":"Hakim Ghazzai","affiliation":["Qatar Mobility Innovations Center, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7511293/8085203/8031038/ghazz-2750721-small.gif","p":["Hakim Ghazzai (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia, in 2015, and the Diplome d\u2019Ingenieur degree in telecommunication engineering and the Master of Science degree from the Ecole Superieure des Communications de Tunis, Tunisia in 2010 and 2011, respectively.

Most of the MUAV-based applications require time-limited access to the spectrum to complete data transmission due to limited battery capacity of the flying units. These characteristics are the origin of two challenges in MUAV-based communications: 1) efficient-energy management and 2) opportunistic spectrum access. This paper proposes an energy-efficient solution to minimize the MUAV\u2019s flying and communication energies while integrating cognitive radio technology. A non-convex optimization problem exploiting the mobility of MUAVs is developed for the underlay operating mode where the data rate threshold of the spectrum\u2019s owner has to be respected. The objective is to determine a joint optimized 3-D location and transmit power control solution by which the secondary MUAV can complete its transmission. A deterministic algorithm based on the Weber formulation is proposed to solve the optimization problem. The performances of the deterministic approach are compared to those of a meta-heuristic algorithm, namely particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). Selected numerical results illustrate the behavior of the MUAV versus various system parameters. It is shown that the proposed solution achieves very close results to those of the PSO in spite of their different conceptional constructions.","doi":"10.1109/TGCN.2017.2750721","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/7511293/8085203/08031038.pdf","startPage":"434","endPage":"443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGCN.2017.2750721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Management of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Underlay Cognitive Radio Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Management of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Underlay Cognitive Radio Systems","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8031038/","volume":"1","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund (a member of The Qatar Foundation)","grantNumber":"NPRP #

Many applications enabled by such communication will be based on a continuous broadcast of information about the own status from each vehicle to the neighborhood, often referred as cooperative awareness or beaconing. Although the only standardized technology allowing direct vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication has been IEEE 802.11p until now, the latest release of longterm evolution (LTE) included advanced device-to-device features designed for the vehicular environment (LTE-V2V) making it a suitable alternative to IEEE 802.11p. Advantages and drawbacks are being considered for both technologies, and which one will be implemented is still under debate. The aim of this paper is thus to provide an insight into the performance of both technologies for cooperative awareness and to compare them. The investigation is performed analytically through the implementation of novel models for both IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2V able to address the same scenario, with consistent settings and focusing on the same output metrics. The proposed models take into account several aspects that are often neglected by related works, such as hidden terminals and capture effect in IEEE 802.11p, the impact of imperfect knowledge of vehicles position on the resource allocation in LTE-V2V, and the various modulation and coding scheme combinations that are available in both technologies. Results show that LTE-V2V allows us to maintain the required quality of service at even double or more the distance than IEEE 802.11p in moderate traffic conditions. However, due to the half-duplex nature of devices and the structure of LTE frames, it shows lower capacity than IEEE 802.11p if short distances and very high vehicle density are targeted.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2750803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2750803","startPage":"10419","endPage":"10432","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8103982/08031051.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2V for the Cooperative Awareness of Connected Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2V for the Cooperative Awareness of Connected Vehicles","volume":"66","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2017","accessionNumber":"17372543","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8031051/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2V for the Cooperative Awareness of Connected Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tvt-bazzi-2750803-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116564S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8103982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"8103982","articleId":"8031051","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8031052,"authors":[{"name":"Francis N.

The concepts of trivially balanced symmetric Boolean function and sporadic balanced Boolean function are extended to this type of perturbations. An observation made by Canteaut and Videau for symmetric Boolean functions of fixed degree is extended. To be specific, it is proved that, excluding the trivial cases, balanced perturbations of fixed degree do not exist when the number of variables grows. Some sporadic balanced perturbations are presented. Finally, a beautiful but unexpected identity between exponential sums for perturbations of two different symmetric Boolean functions is also included in this work.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/8263292/8031052-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031052/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","volume":"64","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"17519229","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8031052/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Diophantine Equations With Binomial Coefficients and Perturbations of Symmetric Boolean Functions","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"NSF-DUE","grantNumber":"1356474"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000873","fundingName":"Mellon-Mays Undergraduate Fellowship"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Diophantine Equations With Binomial Coefficients and Perturbations of Symmetric Boolean Functions","sourcePdf":"tit-medina-2750674-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07636S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8263292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"8263292","articleId":"8031052","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8031053,"authors":[{"name":"Olumuyiwa Ibidunmoye","affiliation":["Computing Science Department, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4275028/8310716/8031053/ibidu-2750906-small.gif","p":["Olumuyiwa Ibidunmoye received the M.Tech. degree in computer science from the Federal University of Technology Akure, Nigeria.

However, the volume and fast changing behavior of metric streams have rendered it a challenging task. Many diagnosis frameworks often rely on thresholding with stationarity or normality assumption, or on complex models requiring extensive offline training. Such techniques are known to be prone to spurious false-alarms in online settings as metric streams undergo rapid contextual changes from known baselines. Hence, we propose two unsupervised incremental techniques following a two-step strategy. First, we estimate an underlying temporal property of the stream via adaptive learning and, then we apply statistically robust control charts to recognize deviations. We evaluated our techniques by replaying over 40 time-series streams from the Yahoo! Webscope S5 datasets as well as four other traces of real Web service QoS and ISP traffic measurements. Our methods achieve high detection accuracy and few false-alarms, and better performance in general compared to an open-source package for time-series anomaly detection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Performance Metric Streams","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2017.2750906","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/4275028/8310716/08031053.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2017.2750906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8310716","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031053/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Performance Metric Streams","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8031053/","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17616620","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Swedish Research Council (VR) for the Cloud Control project","grantNumber":"C0590801"},{"fundingName":"Swedish Strategic Research Program eSSENCE"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"EU Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"610711 (CACTOS)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Performance Metric Streams","sourcePdf":"tnsm-ibidunmoye-2750906-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10754S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"8310716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8310716","articleId":"8031053","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8031061,"authors":[{"name":"Dehong Zhou","affiliation":["Maritime Institute, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8320030/8031061/zhou-2750766-small.gif","p":["Dehong Zhou (S\u201914\u2013M\u201917) was born in Sichuan\n Province, China, in 1989.

It is a promising control technique for three-phase four-switch rectifiers (TPFSRs) because capacitor-voltage-balancing control and instantaneous power control can be simultaneously designed for this type of power converters. However, since only one switching vector is allowed in each control interval, conventional MPPC (C-MPPC) may lead to significant output power ripples that can severely degrade system power quality. This is particularly true for TPFSRs due to the limited number of switching states as well as the constraint imposed by the capacitor-voltage-balancing control. To improve the performance of TPFSRs, this paper proposes a multiple-vector MPPC scheme, which can minimize active power and reactive power ripples and achieve capacitor voltage balancing with a constant switching frequency. An equivalent zero-voltage vector model and a capacitor-voltage-balancing model are derived to implement the proposed control scheme. Comparative experimental results are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed control scheme over the C-MPPC.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2750766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8320030/08031061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2750766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8320030","startPage":"5824","endPage":"5835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-Vector Model-Predictive Power Control of Three-Phase Four-Switch Rectifiers With Capacitor Voltage Balancing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-Vector Model-Predictive Power Control of Three-Phase Four-Switch Rectifiers With Capacitor Voltage Balancing","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031061/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17649672","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8031061/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Singapore Maritime Institute"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-Vector Model-Predictive Power Control of Three-Phase Four-Switch Rectifiers With Capacitor Voltage Balancing","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhou-2750766-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08005S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8320030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8320030","articleId":"8031061","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8031064,"authors":[{"name":"Zhonggang Yin","affiliation":["Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8248572/8031064/yin-2751008-small.gif","p":["Zhonggang Yin (M\u201913) was born in Shandong, China, in 1982.

The simulation and experimental results indicate that the robustness of the proposed optimal design method for ADRC is better than that of the conventional ADRC when the disturbances occur and that the method is feasible and effective.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2751008","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8248572/08031064.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2751008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8248572","startPage":"3077","endPage":"3094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on Autodisturbance-Rejection Control of Induction Motors Based on an Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Research on Autodisturbance-Rejection Control of Induction Motors Based on an Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031064/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17485629","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8031064/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51677150 and 51307139"},{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2015KJXX-29"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on Autodisturbance-Rejection Control of Induction Motors Based on an Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tie-yin-2751008-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134181S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8248572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8248572","articleId":"8031064","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8031066,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086115868"},{"name":"Suneel Yadav","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Suneel","lastName":"Yadav","id":"38581133300"},{"name":"Neetesh Purohit","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Neetesh","lastName":"Purohit","id":"37706919000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"8031066","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1144},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this letter, we derived a mathematical expression that can help in developing a generalized rational sampling rate conversion polyphase finite impulse response filter, for all relatively prime values of the upsampling (L) and downsampling (M) factors.

However, this task is highly difficult to automate due to extremely large variations of building appearances, and still heavily relies on manual work. To attack this problem, we design a deep convolutional network with a simple structure that integrates activation from multiple layers for pixel-wise prediction, and introduce the signed distance function of building boundaries to represent output, which has an enhanced representation power. To train the network, we leverage abundant building footprint data from geographic information systems (GIS) to generate large amounts of labeled data. The trained model achieves a superior performance on datasets that are significantly larger and more complex than those used in prior work, demonstrating that the proposed method provides a promising and scalable solution for automating this labor-intensive task.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031068/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18145246","pubMedId":"28910757","volume":"40","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8031068/","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning Building Extraction in Aerial Scenes with Convolutional Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000266","fundingName":"National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Building Extraction in Aerial Scenes with Convolutional Networks","sourcePdf":"tpami-yuan-2750680-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057505S","chronDate":"Nov. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"8478843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"8478843","articleId":"8031068","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":8031073,"authors":[{"name":"Davide Rossi","affiliation":["Energy Efficient Embedded Systems Laboratory, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Davide Rossi is an Assistant Professor at the Energy Efficient Embedded Systems Laboratory at the University of Bologna.

Space missions like these are exposed to radiation, which is a cause of errors in electronic systems. Memories are one of the electronic systems that need special attention. Radiation effects in memories include single-event upsets (SEUs), multiple cell upsets, and single-event functional interrupts (SEFIs). In this paper, two solutions are presented to protect a nano/pico satellite onboard computer memory prototype with 16-bit data words against SEFIs and SEUs. The prototype uses a 32-bit memory interface, organized in two 16-bit chips. The approach to provide the error-correction capabilities is based on orthogonal latin square codes. The results show that the area and delay introduced by the solutions are acceptable. When a SEFI affects one of the chips, the solutions are able to recover the information using the remaining data.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298/8169690/08031074.pdf","startPage":"698","endPage":"707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SEFI Protection for Nanosat 16-Bit Chip Onboard Computer Memories","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2017.2750718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2017.2750718","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031074/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"SEFI Protection for Nanosat 16-Bit Chip Onboard Computer Memories","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17446621","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8031074/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007136","fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness","grantNumber":"ESP2014-54505-C2-1-R and ESP2014-54505-C2-2-R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEFI Protection for Nanosat 16-Bit Chip Onboard Computer Memories","sourcePdf":"tdmr-sanchezmacian-2750718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083873S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"8169690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8169690","articleId":"8031074","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8031075,"authors":[{"name":"Yannick Saouter","affiliation":["Institut Mines Telecom Atlantique\u2013LAB-STICC, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Yannick","lastName":"Saouter","orcid":"0000-0001-7980-9168","id":"37269011300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8031075","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Elliptic curves","Linear systems","Parity check codes","Mathematical model","Decoding","Telecommunications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parity check codes","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elliptic curves","finite fields","low density parity check codes","LDPC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC","elliptic curves","finite fields"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031075","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8170462/08031075.pdf","startPage":"2558","endPage":"2561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2750660","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2750660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructions of LDPCs From Elliptic Curves Over Finite Fields","abstract":"In this letter, a new framework for the construction of low density parity check codes is exposed.

Consequently, they are far from capturing the critical features of contemporary SSD devices. More importantly, while the performance of modern systems that adopt SSDs can vary based on their numerous internal design parameters and storage-level configurations, a full system simulation with traditional SSD models often requires unreasonably long runtimes and excessive computational resources. In this work, we propose SimpleSSD, a high-fidelity simulator that models all detailed characteristics of hardware and software, while simplifying the nondescript features of storage internals. In contrast to existing SSD simulators, SimpleSSD can easily be integrated into publicly-available full system simulators. In addition, it can accommodate a complete storage stack and evaluate the performance of SSDs along with diverse memory technologies and microarchitectures. Thus, it facilitates simulations that explore the full design space at different levels of system abstraction.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/10208/8316264/8031080-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031080/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-June 1 2018","volume":"17","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17633586","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2018","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8031080/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SimpleSSD: Modeling Solid State Drives for Holistic System Simulation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NRF","grantNumber":"2016R1C1B2015312"},{"fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1640196 and SRC/NRC NERC 2016-NE-2697-A"},{"fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1439021, 1439057, 1409095, 1626251, 1629915, 1629129 and 1526750"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"SimpleSSD: Modeling Solid State Drives for Holistic System Simulation","sourcePdf":"lca-jung-2750658-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101872S","chronDate":"Jan.-June 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"10208","isNumber":"8316264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10208","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8316264","articleId":"8031080","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8031125,"authors":[{"name":"Ramakanth Kavuluru","affiliation":["Division of Biomedical Informatics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY"],"firstName":"Ramakanth","lastName":"Kavuluru","id":"37085697495"},{"name":"Anthony Rios","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Rios","id":"37085697936"},{"name":"Tung Tran","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY"],"firstName":"Tung","lastName":"Tran","id":"37086196845"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4881-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4882-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8031125","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":456},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031125","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Drugs","Recurrent neural networks","Computer architecture","Kernel","Support vector machines","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drugs","medical computing","recurrent neural nets","statistical analysis","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drug-drug interactions","adverse drug reactions","relation extraction","DDI extraction","character-level RNNs","MMF","deep learning","bootstrapping method","mean microF scores","word-level recurrent neural networks","character-level recurrent neural networks","EMR","RNN architectures","unstructured text","confidence intervals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["drug-drug interactions","recurrent neural networks","relation classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICHI.2017.15","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030514/8031114/08031125.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","startPage":"5","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHI.2017.15","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extracting Drug-Drug Interactions with Word and Character-Level Recurrent Neural Networks","abstract":"Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are known to be responsible for nearly a third of all adverse drug reactions. Hence several current efforts focus on extracting signal from EMRs to prioritize DDIs that need further exploration. To this end, being able to extract explicit mentions of DDIs in free text narratives is an important task. In this paper, we explore recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures to detect and classify DDIs from unstructured text using the DDIExtraction dataset from the SemEval 2013 (task 9) shared task. Our methods are in line with those used in other recent deep learning efforts for relation extraction including DDI extraction. However, to our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the potential of character-level RNNs (Char-RNNs) for DDI extraction (and relation extraction in general). Furthermore, we explore a simple but effective model bootstrapping method to (a). build model averaging ensembles, (b). derive confidence intervals around mean micro-F scores (MMF), and (c). assess the average behavior of our methods. Without any rule based filtering of negative examples, a popular heuristic used by most earlier efforts, we achieve an MMF of 69.13. By adding simple replicable heuristics to filter negative instances we are able to achieve an MMF of 70.38. Furthermore, our best ensembles produce micro F-scores of 70.81 (without filtering) and 72.13 (with filtering), which are superior to metrics reported in published results. Although Char-RNNs turnout to be inferior to regular word based RNN models in overall comparisons, we find that ensembling models from both architectures results in nontrivial gains over simply using either alone, indicating that they complement each other.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031125/","accessionNumber":"17190431","pubMedId":"29034375","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8031125/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Extracting Drug-Drug Interactions with Word and Character-Level Recurrent Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extracting Drug-Drug Interactions with Word and Character-Level Recurrent Neural Networks","confLoc":"Park City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"4881a005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07877S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030514","isNumber":"8031114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030514","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8031114","articleId":"8031125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8031130,"authors":[{"name":"Rajaram Anantharaman","affiliation":["School of Computing and Engineering, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri, USA"],"firstName":"Rajaram","lastName":"Anantharaman","id":"37086021941"},{"name":"Vidya Anantharaman","affiliation":["College of Graduate Health Studies, A.

Health promotion is recognized as a viable approach to preventing diseases and disorders and promoting changes in health behaviors or practices. Each year, oral cancer kills more people in the US than does cervical cancer, malignant melanoma, or Hodgkin's disease. A first line of defense against oral diseases is an orofacial selfexamination. The goal of this experiment titled \"Oro Vision\" is to provide an assessment tool for field workers to perform initial examinations of orofacial diseases, using a camera enabled mobile phone. For this experiment, we chose to implement Oro Vision to detect mouth sores. The goal is to extend this model to identify several other Oral diseases such as Thrush, Leukoplakia, Lichenplanus, etc. One variety of mouth sore, referred to as the \"cold sore\" is highly contagious and an infected person can easily pass on the infection to another person just through skin to skin contact. \"Oro Vision\" is implemented as an HTML5 mobile responsive web app that can be accessed through any mobile or standard browser. Oro Vision uses deep learning to train a model and subsequently uses this trained model to distinguish a cold sore from a canker sore. In addition, an accurate diagnosis by a trained healthcare professional is required before any kind of treatment is discussed since several other conditions of the mouth including oral cancer may mimic canker sores.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHI.2017.69","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030514/8031114/08031130.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"45","doi":"10.1109/ICHI.2017.69","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oro Vision: Deep Learning for Classifying Orofacial Diseases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Oro Vision: Deep Learning for Classifying Orofacial Diseases","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8031130/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17190412","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031130/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oro Vision: Deep Learning for Classifying Orofacial Diseases","confLoc":"Park City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"4881a039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07145S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030514","isNumber":"8031114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030514","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8031114","articleId":"8031130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8031131,"authors":[{"name":"Yinchong Yang","affiliation":["Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen Siemens AG, Corporate Technology, Munich"],"firstName":"Yinchong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085867397"},{"name":"Peter A.

Our approach also provides physicians with a list of similar historical patient cases to support the recommended decisions. By using a combination of a Recurrent Neural Network Encoder and a Multinomial Hierarchical Regression Decoder, we specifically tackle two common challenges in modeling clinical data:First, the issue of handling episodic data of variable lengths and, second, the need to represent hierarchical decision procedures.

These results demonstrate the utility of natural language processing(NLP) and machine learning for EHR-based phenotyping.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030514/8031114/08031135.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"90","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Machine Learning Algorithm for Identifying Atopic Dermatitis in Adults from Electronic Health Records","doi":"10.1109/ICHI.2017.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHI.2017.31","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Machine Learning Algorithm for Identifying Atopic Dermatitis in Adults from Electronic Health Records","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17190374","pubMedId":"29104964","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8031135/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Machine Learning Algorithm for Identifying Atopic Dermatitis in Adults from Electronic Health Records","confLoc":"Park City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"4881a083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073648S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030514","isNumber":"8031114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030514","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8031114","articleId":"8031135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8031146,"authors":[{"name":"William Stephen van der Kamp","affiliation":["University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, CA"],"firstName":"William Stephen","lastName":"van der Kamp","id":"37086130258"},{"name":"Nathaniel David Osgood","affiliation":["University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"firstName":"Nathaniel David","lastName":"Osgood","id":"37542896700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4881-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4882-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8031146","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"abstract":"Smartphone-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers growing value for health research.

Studies have discovered that children with autistic spectrum disorder exhibit certain actions through which we can anticipate mutilating meltdowns in them. The objective of our project is to build a system that can recognize such kind of actions using deep learning techniques thereby, notifying the caretakers/parents so that they can get the situation under control in lesser time. Using deep learning RCNNs, we can train the system faster yet reliable because unlike all the machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms are more efficient and have more scope into future. We have trained a classifier on images that are gathered from videos and reliable internet sources with most predictive gestures, through which we can detect the meltdowns more precisely. We have trained a model that validated the accuracy by ~93% which is accompanied by a loss/train classifier with a minimal 0.4% loss. Functional testing was done through feeding the deep neural network with chosen actions performed by five individuals that resulted in an accuracy of ~92% in all cases, which can assure the real-time usage of the system.","doi":"10.1109/ICHI.2017.35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHI.2017.35","startPage":"391","endPage":"396","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030514/8031114/08031180.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning Based Recognition of Meltdown in Autistic Kids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Based Recognition of Meltdown in Autistic Kids","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8031180/","accessionNumber":"17190378","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031180/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning Based Recognition of Meltdown in Autistic Kids","confLoc":"Park City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"4881a391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072351S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030514","isNumber":"8031114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030514","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8031114","articleId":"8031180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-03"},{"_id":8031199,"authors":[{"name":"Morgan Harrell","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee"],"firstName":"Morgan","lastName":"Harrell","id":"37086014949"},{"name":"Mia Levy","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee"],"firstName":"Mia","lastName":"Levy","id":"37086006871"},{"name":"Daniel Fabbri","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Fabbri","id":"37070120400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4881-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4882-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8031199","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031199","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medical diagnostic imaging","Tumors","Electronic medical records","Neural networks","Drugs","Breast cancer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","electronic health records","health care","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical computing","neural nets","patient care","patient treatment","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjuvant endocrine therapy medication records","random forest classifier","electronic health record data","adjuvant endocrine therapy patient cohort","adjuvant endocrine therapy patient population","demographic related features","patient care","supervised machine learning","tumor registry records","appointment logs","Vanderbilt University Medical Center","EHR data","VUMC","appointment-related features","medical-related features","neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["electronic health records","machine learning","breast cancer"]}],"abstract":"Long-term adjuvant endocrine therapy patients often fail to follow-up with their care providers for the recommended duration of time. We used electronic health record data, tumor registry records, and appointment logs to predict follow-up for an adjuvant endocrine therapy patient cohort. Learning predictors for follow-up may facilitate interventions that improve follow-up rates, and ultimately improve patient care in the adjuvant endocrine therapy patient population.We selected 1455 adjuvant endocrine therapy patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and modeled them as a matrix of medical-related, appointment-related, and demographic related features derived from EHR data. We built and optimized a random forest classifier and neural network to differentiate between patients that follow-up, or fail to follow-up, with their care provider for at least five years. We measured follow-up three different ways: thought appointments with any care providers, appointments with an oncologist, and adjuvant endocrine therapy medication records. Classifiers make predictions at the start of adjuvant endocrine therapy, and additionally use temporal subsets of data to learn the change in accuracy as patient data accrues.Our best model is a random forest classifier combining medical-related, appointment-related, and demographic-related features to achieve an AUC of 0.74. The most predictive features for follow-up in our random forest model are total medication counts, patient age, and median income for zip code. We suggest that reliable prediction for follow-up may be correlated with amount of care received at VUMC (i.e., VUMC primary care).This study achieved moderately accurate prediction for followup in adjuvant endocrine therapy patients from electronic health record data. Predicting follow-up can facilitate interventions for improving follow-up rates and improve patient care for adjuvant endocrine therapy cohorts. This study demonstrates the ability to find opportunities for patient care improvement from EHR data.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHI.2017.46","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030514/8031114/08031199.pdf","startPage":"490","endPage":"495","doi":"10.1109/ICHI.2017.46","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervised Machine Learning to Predict Follow-Up Among Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Patients","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Supervised Machine Learning to Predict Follow-Up Among Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Patients","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8031199/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17190419","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031199/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised Machine Learning to Predict Follow-Up Among Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Patients","confLoc":"Park City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"4881a490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097735S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030514","isNumber":"8031114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030514","xplore-issue":"8031114","articleId":"8031199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8031211,"authors":[{"name":"Javad Birjandtalab","affiliation":["Quality of Life Technology Laboratory, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Javad","lastName":"Birjandtalab","id":"38579249700"},{"name":"Mehrdad Heydarzadeh","affiliation":["Quality of Life Technology Laboratory, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Heydarzadeh","id":"37085658281"},{"name":"Mehrdad Nourani","affiliation":["Quality of Life Technology Laboratory, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Nourani","id":"37273839500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4881-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4882-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8031211","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":982},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Feature extraction","Multilayer perceptrons","Biological neural networks","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical disorders","medical signal detection","medical signal processing","multilayer perceptrons","neural nets","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency domain","normalized in-band power spectral density","nonlinear technique","multilayer perceptrons","deep learning technique","power spectral density","epileptic seizures","EEG signals","deep neural networks","epileptic seizure detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Seizure detection","EEG signals","Feature extraction","Multi Layer Perceptron","Deep Neural Networks"]}],"abstract":"Millions of people around the world suffer from epilepsy.

The matching network can be generally expressed as a path on the Smith chart and given the load and source impedances, there are theoretically infinite ways to achieve the transformation. When losses are included, each path will encounter a different loss, and currently, no comprehensive theory exist for finding the most optimal matching network. Furthermore, the networks will also provide different bandwidths of operation. Due to the matching network losses, it is often not optimal to force conjugate matching for maximizing end-to-end power transfer efficiency. In this paper, we provide a method toward finding 1) the globally most efficient path between two arbitrary impedances with lossy passives; 2) given the source and the load impedances, the optimal (typically non-conjugate) impedance to match and the highest efficiency path to reach the impedance; and 3) upper bounds on achievable efficiencies under the various scenarios. This paper also proposes ways to combine this method with nonlinear load-pull simulations for optimal combiner and matching network for integrated power amplifiers. This analysis creates interesting ways to maximize efficiency and bandwidths simultaneously and the paper also discusses this joint optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of globally optimal impedance transformation networks between arbitrary impedances with lossy passives.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2720179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2720179","startPage":"257","endPage":"269","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8248584/08031276.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8248584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Globally Optimal Matching Networks With Lossy Passives and Efficiency Bounds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Globally Optimal Matching Networks With Lossy Passives and Efficiency Bounds","volume":"65","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17520034","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8031276/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N00014-15-1-2217"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Globally Optimal Matching Networks With Lossy Passives and Efficiency Bounds","sourcePdf":"tcsi-sengupta-2720179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073738S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8248584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8248584","articleId":"8031276","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8031279,"authors":[{"name":"Tiedi Zhang","affiliation":["EHF Key Laboratory of Science, School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Tiedi","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0003-2028-6037","id":"37086016384"},{"name":"Ruimin Xu","affiliation":["EHF Key Laboratory of Science, School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ruimin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37267217500"},{"name":"Chung-Tse Michael Wu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Chung-Tse Michael","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0002-0400-5082","id":"38238040100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"8031279","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":863},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Inductors","Circuit stability","Capacitors","Transistors","Shunts (electrical)","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","delay circuits","distributed amplifiers","microwave filters","transversal filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active transversal-filter","negative group delay circuit","microwave transversal-filter","NGD circuit","unilateral nonFoster element","unconditionally stable nonfoster element","distributed amplifier","distributed topology","shunt capacitor","series inductor","capacitance -1.0 pF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed amplifier (DA)","negative capacitance","negative group delay (NGD)","negative inductance","non-Foster element"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031279","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2017.2745487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2017.2745487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8059715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/8059715/08031279.pdf","startPage":"921","endPage":"923","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unconditionally Stable Non-Foster Element Using Active Transversal-Filter-Based Negative Group Delay Circuit","abstract":"This letter introduces a novel type of non-Foster element using a microwave transversal-filter-based negative group delay (NGD) circuit that can exhibit unconditional stability. The proposed device is realized by a distributed amplifier, in which the NGD response is synthesized by adjusting the ratio of transconductance of transistors in each stage. On top of this, by properly amending the in-band magnitude and phase characteristics, the NGD circuit can realize non-Foster elements within the operating band. Furthermore, thanks to the distributed topology, the proposed network has very good input and output matching characteristics. As proof-of-concept, a prototype of the proposed non-Foster element is built to validate the proposed scheme.

We first introduce vehicular channel characteristics and modeling, which are the key underlying features differentiating vehicular communications from other types of wireless systems. We then present schemes to estimate the time-varying vehicular channels and various modulation techniques to deal with high-mobility channels.

However, an exhaustive benchmarking study has never been performed. As a result, the performance of the MOEAs has not been well understood yet. Moreover, in almost all previous studies, the performance of the MOEAs was evaluated based on nondominated solutions in the final population at the end of the search. Such traditional benchmarking methodology has several critical issues. In this paper, we exhaustively investigate the anytime performance of 21 MOEAs using an unbounded external archive (UEA), which stores all nondominated solutions found during the search process. Each MOEA is evaluated under two optimization scenarios called UEA and reduced UEA in addition to the standard final population scenario. These two scenarios are more practical in real-world applications than the final population scenario. Experimental results obtained under the two scenarios are significantly different from the previously reported results under the final population scenario. For example, results on the Walking Fish Group test problems with up to six objectives indicate that some recently proposed MOEAs are outperformed by some classical MOEAs. We also analyze the reason why some classical MOEAs work well under the UEA and the reduced UEA scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2751071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2751071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08031325.pdf","startPage":"19597","endPage":"19619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benchmarking Multi- and Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms Under Two Optimization Scenarios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Benchmarking Multi- and Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms Under Two Optimization Scenarios","volume":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8031325/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17266485","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031325/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MEXT\u2014Development of Innovative Design and Production Processes that Lead the Way for the Manufacturing Industry in the Near Future through Priority Issue on Post-K computer"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Benchmarking Multi- and Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms Under Two Optimization Scenarios","sourcePdf":"access-tanabe-2751071-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.227418S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8031325","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8031326,"authors":[{"name":"Zamshed Chowdhury","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN"],"firstName":"Zamshed","lastName":"Chowdhury","orcid":"0000-0002-4096-7000","id":"37393524500"},{"name":"Jonathan D.

However, due to intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, to what extent RDG could provide capacity to power systems becomes a critical issue to the utility company when implementing long-term system strategic (generation expansion) planning. On the other hand, in a smart-grid frame, the popularization of different varieties of demand-side resources enables the system to operate at more flexible modes ever before. The potential variability in load demand not only introduces additional dynamics and uncertainties to the system, but could also affect the reliability benefits of RDG. Therefore, in practice, to effectively estimate the reliability value of RDG in power systems, the potential interaction between generationand demand-side must be properly captured. In this paper, a study to assess the capacity credit (CC) of RDG in a context of distributed generation system is performed with consideration of the impacts of demand response (DR). A compound reliability model for DR is presented, which considers the uncertainties involved in both instant response and follow-on load recovery processes. On this basis, an assessment framework for the CC of RDG based on sequential Monte Carlo simulation is developed by which the inter-temporal characteristics of DR resources can be fully captured. The numerical study is implemented based on the IEEE-38 bus test case. The calculation results demonstrate that the CC of RDG would depend on a variety of factors, including penetration level, responsiveness of load demand and the correlations between RDG and DR availability. Also, it is shown that accounting for the underlying effect of DR is of absolute importance, otherwise the CC of RDG might be estimated erroneously in real practices.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2745198","startPage":"14307","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

Power Control for NOMA Wireless Networks With Relays","abstract":"In this letter, we propose a novel approach for dynamically selecting an optimal relay mode and optimal transmission power levels in non-orthogonal multiple access wireless networks with relays. To maximize the network throughput, the proposed approach alternates between the one-relay mode and the two-relay mode based on channel state information. For the two-relay mode, we derive novel closed-form results on optimal power control. Unlike in a conventional one-hop network, it is not always optimal to allocate all power to the relay with the largest channel gain in the studied two-hop network. Based on the closed-form results, one could determine the optimal power levels quickly. Simulation results show that the proposed approach could significantly increase the network throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031329/","volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8031329/","accessionNumber":"17595957","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Control for NOMA Wireless Networks With Relays","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 105-2221-E-009-034"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Control for NOMA Wireless Networks With Relays","sourcePdf":"lwc-gau-2751041-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046483S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8293945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8293945","articleId":"8031329","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8031331,"authors":[{"name":"Xiazhi Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shantou University, Shantou, China","School of Computer Science and Educational Software, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8031331/lai-2751105-small.gif","p":["Xiazhi Lai received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Shantou University in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree.

We consider the interference-limited environments, where the reception at the relays and the destination are corrupted by random interferers, which are distributed according to a homogeneous Poisson point process. To improve the system performance, relay selection based on received signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) has been employed to select the best relay among N ones. We examine the network performance by deriving the analytical outage probability under Rayleigh fading transmission channels and Nakagami-m fading interference channels. Moreover, we compute the asymptotic expressions of outage probability, and confirm that the system diversity order on SIR is equal to 2/\u03b1, where \u03b1 denotes the path loss factor. Furthermore, we see that the major limitation of system results from the second hop. Numerical and simulation results are demonstrated to validate the proposed analysis as well.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2751105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","startPage":"18909","endPage":"18917","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08031331.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DF Relaying Networks With Randomly Distributed Interferers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8031331/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"DF Relaying Networks With Randomly Distributed Interferers","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17266486","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007162","fundingName":"Science and Technology Planning Key Project of Guangdong","grantNumber":"2016B010124014"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471229, 61573233 and 61772007"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Improvement Project for Universities","grantNumber":"2015KTSCX040"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong","grantNumber":"2014A030306027 and 2015A030311017"},{"fundingName":"Guangzhou University\u2019s 2017 Training Program for Young Top-Notch Personnels","grantNumber":"BJ201702"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"DF Relaying Networks With Randomly Distributed Interferers","sourcePdf":"access-lai-2751105-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096425S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8031331","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8031332,"authors":[{"name":"Guoru Ding","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/8302422/8031332/ding-2751058-small.gif","p":["Guoru Ding (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914\u2013SM\u201916) received the B.S.

In the past few years, spectrum inference has gained increasing attention owing to its wide applications in cognitive radio networks (CRNs), ranging from adaptive spectrum sensing, and predictive spectrum mobility, to dynamic spectrum access and smart topology control, to name just a few. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey and tutorial on the recent advances in spectrum inference. Specifically, we first present the preliminaries of spectrum inference, including the sources of spectrum occupancy statistics, the models of spectrum usage, and characterize the predictability of spectrum state evolution. By introducing the taxonomy of spectrum inference from a time-frequency-space perspective, we offer an in-depth tutorial on the existing algorithms. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis of various spectrum inference algorithms and discuss the metrics of evaluating the efficiency of spectrum inference. We also portray the various potential applications of spectrum inference in CRNs and beyond, with an outlook to the fifth-generation mobile communications and next generation high frequency communications systems. Last but not least, we highlight the critical research challenges and open issues ahead.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8302422/08031332.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"182","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2017.2751058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2017.2751058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8302422","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Inference in Cognitive Radio Networks: Algorithms and Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Tutorials","Inference algorithms","Cognitive radio","Prediction algorithms","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio networks","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum inference algorithms","radio spectrum","predictive spectrum mobility","spectrum occupancy statistics","cognitive radio networks","time-frequency-space perspective"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum inference","spectrum prediction","cognitive radio","5G","HF communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Inference in Cognitive Radio Networks: Algorithms and Applications","volume":"20","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8031332/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2018","accessionNumber":"17599746","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501510 and 61631020"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20150717"},{"fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Science Funded Project"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Planned Projects for Post-Doctoral Research Funds"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401223 and 61522109"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20140887 and BK20150040"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council\u2019s Advance Fellow Grant Beam-Me-Up"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society\u2019s Wolfson Research Merit Award"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Inference in Cognitive Radio Networks: Algorithms and Applications","sourcePdf":"comst-hanzo-2751058-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.47703S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8302422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"8302422","articleId":"8031332","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":8031333,"authors":[{"name":"Yahia R.

More in detail, first the design of a mobility-aware strategy for user association in 5G mmW networks is posed as a constrained optimization problem. Then, it is showed that the proposed strategy exhibits several attractive features: a) it is able to track the dynamic changes in the network topology and in the channel conditions induced by the user mobility; b) it takes into account the distribution of the loads among the small base stations (sBSs), thus overcoming to associate an UE to an already congested sBS. This, in turn, affects positively the overall fairness of the network; c) it overcomes overly frequent handovers between sBSs, and thus the need of frequent re-association; d) it takes into account the peculiar aspects of the mmW communications, such as directionality, sensitivity to blockage, and NLoS propagation effects; and e) it is fully distributed, i.e., each mobile user associates to an sBS independently of each other, stemming from local information only. Furthermore, it is showed that the exhaustive search for the solution of the posed optimization problem is computationally unfeasible. Consequently, within this paper, an efficient algorithm exhibiting a polynomial-time complexity is proposed. Finally, the numerical results validate the benefits of adopting the proposed mobility-aware and fully distributed association rule. In particular, it is quantified the very significant performance enhancement of the proposed association with respect to the conventional RSS-based one.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2751422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2751422","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08031335.pdf","startPage":"21497","endPage":"21507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobility-Aware User Association for 5G mmWave Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Mobility-Aware User Association for 5G mmWave Networks","volume":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8031335/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17515787","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031335/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CNIT"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Mobility-Aware User Association for 5G mmWave Networks","sourcePdf":"access-cacciapuoti-2751422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087897S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8031335","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8031336,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Kliks","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8031336/kliks-2751138-small.gif","p":["Adrian Kliks (SM\u201912) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in telecommunication from the Poznan University of Technology, in 2005 and 2011, respectively.

Practical realization of this paradigm entails the need for the true protection of the incumbent system, and at the same time the guarantee of the quality of the services offered to the secondary users. In this respect, this paper discusses the results achieved in numerous measurement campaigns performed for last years in two European cities, i.e., Poznan, Poland, and Barcelona, Spain. Both indoor and outdoor measurements of the TV band have been compared with the main purpose of true identification of key practical considerations for spectrum sharing in the TV white spaces. As such, this paper constitutes a concise summary of various analyses and provides pragmatic guidelines for deployment of radio-environment maps (REM)-based systems. Based on the conducted measurements and achieved results, the set of practical conclusions for REMs has been deduced, and the prospective procedure of deployment of such a network has been proposed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031336/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17266487","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8031336/","displayDocTitle":"Application of Radio Environment Maps for Dynamic Broadband Access in TV Bands in Urban Areas","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004281","fundingName":"National Science Centre, Poland, through the SONATA Project","grantNumber":"DEC-2015/17/D/ST7/04078"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Research Council and FEDER funds under RAMSES","grantNumber":"TEC2013-41698-R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Application of Radio Environment Maps for Dynamic Broadband Access in TV Bands in Urban Areas","sourcePdf":"access-kliks-2751138-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145788S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8031336","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8031340,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanjie Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Railway Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuanjie","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-3601-4079","id":"37085483509"},{"name":"Qimei Cui","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Mobile Network Technologies, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qimei","lastName":"Cui","id":"37566866200"},{"name":"Martin Haenggi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Haenggi","orcid":"0000-0001-8547-0607","id":"37273257100"},{"name":"Zhenhui Tan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Railway Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenhui","lastName":"Tan","orcid":"0000-0002-7862-1910","id":"37086084261"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8031340","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":424},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Transmitters","Interference cancellation","Integrated circuit modeling","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","interference suppression","radio networks","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Poisson networks","interference cancellation","SIR metadistribution analysis","C-IC model","betadistribution approximation","mean local delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stochastic geometry","Poisson networks","meta distribution","interference cancellation","mean local delay"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a theoretical framework for the analysis of the meta distribution of the SIR for Poisson networks with interference cancellation (IC) enabled at the receivers, which gives deep insight into the network performance on a link-wise basis.

This is because the capacitors may lose most of the stored energy during a long sleep period, and thus every sleep-to-active transition requires full recharging of the capacitors. In this brief, we present an energy efficient capacitor charging technique called split-capacitor charging, which charges a capacitor array in a step-wise fashion. Circuit simulations demonstrate that the proposed technique can reduce the energy wastage during sleep-to-active transition up to 66%. When tested on load circuits with a short active period, a voltage converter employing the proposed charging method shows up to 24% improvement in energy efficiency over conventional SC converters.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2017.2751146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8365894/08031342.pdf","startPage":"779","endPage":"783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8365894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2017.2751146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy Efficient Charging Technique for Switched Capacitor Voltage Converters With Low-Duty Ratio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","displayDocTitle":"An Energy Efficient Charging Technique for Switched Capacitor Voltage Converters With Low-Duty Ratio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031342/","publicationDate":"June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17800992","htmlLink":"/document/8031342/","volume":"65","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003696","fundingName":"ETRI through the Korean Government","grantNumber":"17ZB1600"},{"fundingName":"Center for Integrated Smart Sensors with Global Frontier Project through the Korean Government","grantNumber":"CISS-2016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy Efficient Charging Technique for Switched Capacitor Voltage Converters With Low-Duty Ratio","sourcePdf":"tcsii-kim-2751146-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077789S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8365894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8365894","articleId":"8031342","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8031344,"authors":[{"name":"Behzad Khamidehi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Behzad","lastName":"Khamidehi","id":"37085864603"},{"name":"Maryam Sabbaghian","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Sabbaghian","orcid":"0000-0003-4387-590X","id":"37294633700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"8031344","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":475},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","Uplink","Quality of service","Wireless networks","Macrocell networks","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","frequency division multiple access","integer programming","quality of service","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","cross-tier interference","macrocell data rate","subcarrier assignment","subcarrier allocation","SC-FDMA femtocell networks","uplink femtocell networks","air interface","single carrier frequency division multiple access","minimum mean square error frequency domain equalizers","resource allocation","zero forcing","quality of service requirement constraint","binary integer programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","heterogeneous networks","LTE uplink","resource allocation","QoS","SC-FDMA"]}],"abstract":"We consider joint subcarrier and power allocation problem for uplink femtocell networks. The air interface is single carrier frequency division multiple access. We consider zero forcing and minimum mean square error frequency domain equalizers. To formulate the resource allocation problem, we derive a closed-form expression for the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Since the cross-tier interference can deteriorate the macrocell data rate, we impose a temperature limit on the interference arising from femtousers to the macro-base station. This constraint protects the data rate of the macrousers. Moreover, we consider the quality of service requirement constraint for the high data rate femtousers, and the adjacency of the assigned subcarriers to a user. We divide the optimization procedure into two steps: the power allocation and the subcarrier assignment. In the first step, we use the dual problem to obtain the optimal powers. In the second step, we formulate the problem of subcarrier allocation as binary integer programming (BIP). The BIP problem is NP-hard and cannot be solved in polynomial time. To reduce the complexity, we propose a practical suboptimal algorithm for the subcarrier assignment, which is significantly simpler than the BIP approach.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2751077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8723653/08031344.pdf","startPage":"4573","endPage":"4585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2751077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8723653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for SC-FDMA Femtocell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031344/","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for SC-FDMA Femtocell Networks","volume":"68","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18708491","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8031344/","dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for SC-FDMA Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-sabbaghian-2751077-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138748S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8723653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8723653","articleId":"8031344","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8031345,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Barzegarkhoo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sahand University of Technology, Renewable Energy Center, Tabriz, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8350354/8031345/barze-2751419-small.gif","p":["Reza Barzegarkhoo received the B.S. degree in electrical power\n engineering from the University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran, in 2010, and the M.S. degree in electrical power engineering\n from the Sahand University of Technology, Tabriz, Iran, in 2012.

It has several advantages over the classical topologies, such as an appropriate boosting property, higher efficiency, lower number of required dc voltage sources, and other accompanying components with less complexity and lower cost. The basic structure of the proposed converter is capable of making nine-level of the output voltage under different kinds of loading conditions. Hereby, by using the same two capacitors paralleled to a single dc source, a switched-capacitor (SC) cell is made that contributes to boosting the value of the input voltage. In this case, the balanced voltage of the capacitors can be precisely provided on the basis of the series-parallel technique and the redundant switching states. Afterward, to reach the higher number of output voltage levels, two suggested SC cells are connected to each other with a new extended configuration. Therefore, by the use of a reasonable number of required power electronic devices, and also by utilizing only two isolated dc voltage sources, which their magnitudes can be designed based on either symmetric or asymmetric types, a 17- and 49-level of the output voltage are obtained. Based on the proposed extended configuration, a new generalized version of SCMLIs is also derived. To confirm the precise performance of the proposed topologies, apart from the theoretical analysis and a complete comparison, several simulation and experimental results are also given.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","volume":"33","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"17737001","dateOfInsertion":"26 April 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8031345/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A New Boost Switched-Capacitor Multilevel Converter With Reduced Circuit Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Boost Switched-Capacitor Multilevel Converter With Reduced Circuit Devices","sourcePdf":"tpel-barzegarkhoo-2751419-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129732S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8350354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"8350354","articleId":"8031345","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8031348,"authors":[{"name":"Jaime Font","affiliation":["SVIT Research Group, San Jorge University, Zaragoza, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/8367832/8031348/font-2751100-small.gif","p":["Jaime Font received the M.Sc. degree in advanced software technologies from San Jorge University, Zaragoza, Spain.

Feature location is one of the most important and common activities performed by developers during software maintenance and evolution. Features must be located across families of products and the software artifacts that realize each feature must be identified. However, when dealing with industrial software artifacts, the search space can be huge. We propose and compare five search algorithms to locate features over families of product models guided by latent semantic analysis (LSA), a technique that measures similarities between textual queries. The algorithms are applied to two case studies from our industrial partners (leading manufacturers of home appliances and rolling stock) and are compared in terms of precision and recall. Statistical analysis of the results is performed to provide evidence of the significance of the results. The combination of an evolutionary algorithm with LSA can be used to locate features in families of models from industrial scenarios such as the ones from our industrial partners.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/8367832/08031348.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2017.2751100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2017.2751100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8367832","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving Feature Location in Families of Models Through the Use of Search-Based Software Engineering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductors","Algorithm design and analysis","Software","Encoding","Search problems","Software engineering","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["query processing","search problems","software engineering","software maintenance","software product lines","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature location","software maintenance","industrial software artifacts","search algorithms","latent semantic analysis","software evolution","search-based software engineering techniques","product model families","LSA","textual queries","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evolutionary algorithm (EA)","families of models","feature location (FL)","search-based software engineering (SBSE)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Achieving Feature Location in Families of Models Through the Use of Search-Based Software Engineering","volume":"22","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8031348/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17800959","dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Spanish National R+D+i Plan and ERDF Funds (Model-Driven Variability Extraction for Software Product Line Adoption)","grantNumber":"TIN2015-64397-R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving Feature Location in Families of Models Through the Use of Search-Based Software Engineering","sourcePdf":"tevc-font-2751100-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162477S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"8367832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8367832","articleId":"8031348","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8031362,"authors":[{"name":"Limin Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power Electronics and Electric Drive, Institute of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8320030/8031362/yang-2751068-small.gif","p":["Limin Yang was born in Shanxi Province, China, in 1991.

Conventionally, the SHCC component eliminating methods are usually adopted to reduce the loss. The relationship between the loss of MMC and the SHCC component is analyzed first in this paper. The analysis shows that the conventional eliminating methods are not optimal in terms of the minimum loss of MMC. A loss optimization control scheme is also proposed by injecting the optimal SHCC component into the arm current of MMC, rather than eliminating the SHCC component of the arm current.

MSCS achieves an excellent tradeoff between computational complexity and bit error rate (BER). Based on the maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) estimation, MSCS applies discrete optimization to some streams and continuous optimization to others. First, the discrete optimization constrains some streams to a certain set of modulation symbols. The continuous optimization is then used to identify the optimal continuous values of the other streams under this constrained condition and quantizes the results. A signal candidate comprises the quantized optimal values and constrained streams. Multiple constraint patterns result in multiple signal candidates, and sphere decoding (SD) identifies the detected signal as the one that maximizes the likelihood function. Limiting the number of constrained streams and applying SD can reduce computational complexity. In addition, MSCS selects constrained streams that have large variances of Gaussian distributions obtained from the MAP estimation. As a result of this stream selection method, MSCS can maintain an excellent BER performance even when the constrained streams are few in number. Computer simulations in 8-by-8 MIMO channels with modulation schemes of 16-and 64-QAM demonstrate that MSCS suffers degradation of merely 0.2 dB in average BER performance compared to the maximum likelihood detection (MLD). We also show that MSCS can achieve a similar average BER performance as that of the QR decomposition and M algorithm (QRM-MLD) while requiring less computational complexity. Under uncorrelated channels, the complexity of MSCS is less than 1/2 and 1/4 that of QRM-MLD in the case of 16-and 64-QAM, respectively. By contrast, simulations under channels with transmit-side spatial correlation show that when 16-QAM is used and average E\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sub>\n/N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n is equal to 18 dB, the complexity of MSCS ranges from 3/10 to 2/5 that of QRM-MLD.

Data acquisition for EM-WNSNs faces two challenges: 1) the dynamic IoT backhaul bandwidth and 2) THz channel conditions that jointly impact resource utilization efficiency. Specifically, the mismatch between the demands of the EM-WNSNs and the available bandwidth of the backhaul link reduces the bandwidth efficiency of IoT backhaul or the energy efficiency of EM-WNSNs. To address the new constraints that emerge from the EM-WNSN, an on-demand probabilistic (OP) polling scheme is proposed for the backhaul tier of EM-WNSNs which is composed of nano sinks that aggregate and transport data from nano sensors to the IoT gateway. OP polling adjusts the packet aggregation process of nano sinks according to the up-to-date network conditions. From performance evaluation, OP polling achieves an 18% higher bandwidth efficiency compared to the previously proposed on-demand efficient polling and 69% less energy consumption compared to the greedy polling.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8172502/08031398.pdf","startPage":"2217","endPage":"2227","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2751524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2751524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8172502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Demand Probabilistic Polling for Nanonetworks Under Dynamic IoT Backhaul Network Conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031398/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"On-Demand Probabilistic Polling for Nanonetworks Under Dynamic IoT Backhaul Network Conditions","htmlLink":"/document/8031398/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17541304","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Demand Probabilistic Polling for Nanonetworks Under Dynamic IoT Backhaul Network Conditions","sourcePdf":"jiot-seah-2751524-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152463S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8172502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8172502","articleId":"8031398","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8031403,"authors":[{"name":"Hongjun Wang","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Hongjun Wang received the master\u2019s degree from the China University of Mining and Technology.

Among various encoders, Fisher vector (FV) is one of the probabilistic methods that yield promising results. However, its huge representation is fairly forbidding. In this paper, we present approaches to efficiently compress FV and retain its robustness. First, we put forward a new Compact FV (CFV) descriptor. The CFV is obtained by zeroing out small posteriors, calculating first-order statistics and reweighting its elements properly. Second, in light of Iterative Quantization (ITQ) scheme, we present a Generalized ITQ (GITQ) method to binarize our CFV. Finally, we apply our CFV and GITQ to encode convolutional activations of convolutional neural networks. We evaluate our methods on FERET, LFW, AR, and FRGC 2.0 datasets, and our experiments reveal the advantage of such a framework.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressing Fisher Vector for Robust Face Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2749331","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08031403.pdf","startPage":"23157","endPage":"23165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2749331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031403/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Compressing Fisher Vector for Robust Face Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8031403/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17381098","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471048, 61573068 and 61375031"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"Beijing Nova Program","grantNumber":"Z161100004916088"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2014ZD03-01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Compressing Fisher Vector for Robust Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"access-deng-2749331-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095227S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8031403","onlineDate":"11 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8031453,"authors":[{"name":"Jiachen Li","affiliation":["Sch of Electr.

Most of the related work focused on the sniffer-channel assignment problem, i.e, assigning proper operational channel to wireless sniffers with the aim of tracking and capturing the target signals or data packets. These approaches were usually designed for the scenarios in which the malicious or suspect wireless users are known. In this paper, we focus on the problem of spectrum patrolling, in which the sniffers have no specific targets, but try to patrol the interested temporal, spatial or spectrum areas. Once the periodicity or regularity of the wireless traffics is identified, a patrol path will be developed for routine patrolling. The path planning problem is formulated as a robust reward maximization problem with uncertain channel information. We propose an algorithm to determine the optimal solution and validate it through numerical simulations. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve the maximal reward even with unknown information of the user activities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17190449","htmlLink":"/document/8031453/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Robust Optimal Spectrum Patrolling for Passive Monitoring in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Optimal Spectrum Patrolling for Passive Monitoring in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"0958a063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066885S","chronDate":"21-23 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8031003","isNumber":"8031434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8031003","xplore-issue":"8031434","articleId":"8031453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8031454,"authors":[{"name":"Jiachen Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jiachen","lastName":"Li","id":"37086157438"},{"name":"Yue Mi","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Mi","id":"37086155662"},{"name":"Shimin Gong","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Shimin","lastName":"Gong","id":"37086068757"},{"name":"Jing Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086150734"},{"name":"Xiaoxia Huang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxia","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086004569"},{"name":"Yanyan Shen","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Yanyan","lastName":"Shen","id":"37086074152"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0958-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0959-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8031454","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031454","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","concave programming","cooperative communication","energy harvesting","iterative methods","multicast communication","relay networks (telecommunication)","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink multicasting","wirelessly powered communication network","multiple receivers","energy harvesting","EH","power splitting protocol","information transmission","power splitting ratio","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR maximization problem","HAP signal beamforming","HAP RF signals","cooperative multirelay assisted multicast beamforming","multiple energy-constrained relay node","single antenna","multiantenna hybrid access point","SNR maximisation","relay channel conditions","iterative algorithm","semidefinite program"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIT.2017.62","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8031003/8031434/08031454.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"74","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2017.62","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Multi-relay Assisted Multicast Beamforming in Wirelessly Powered Communications","abstract":"This paper studied downlink multicasting in a wirelessly powered communication network, where multiple energy-constrained relay nodes collaboratively assist the transmissions from a multi-antenna hybrid access point (HAP) to multiple receivers in the downlink. Each relay is equipped with a single antenna and capable of energy harvesting (EH) from the HAP's RF signals in a power splitting protocol. Due to the confliction between EH and information transmission at the relays, they need to optimally control the power splitting ratio, according to the relays' channel conditions and energy status, with the aim of improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at all receivers. We propose a SNR maximization problem by jointly optimizing the HAP's signal beamforming and the relays' EH parameters.

Groups of multiplexed users are formed, where each user is equipped with a single antenna, to transmit on the same frequency and time resources. When deployed in a V-MIMO system that resembles the LTE standard parameters, the proposed blind algorithm can obtain accurate estimates of the V-MIMO channels for each active user over every block of transmitted data. In addition, it is necessary to have knowledge of the channels state information to perform the users grouping and frequency allocation (scheduling). According to the LTE standard, sounding reference signals are employed in conjugation with Interleaved-frequency division multiple-access (I-FDMA). By eliminating the need to transmit an entire block of pilot symbols for each active transmitter, this permits for additional bandwidth efficiency in V-MIMO SC-FDMA systems in which multiple users occupy the same set of subcarriers as indicated by the LTE standard. The advantages of employing our proposed blind subspace-based channel estimation algorithm are verified by simulations results over fading channels, which demonstrate its practicality for use in the resulting V-MIMO SC-FDMA scheme with reduced training.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology

emerging paradigms of the Internet of Things (IoT) that are used to retrieve content including scalar data, video and audio streams and still images from the physical environment. In contrast to scalar sensor (such as temperature and humidity sensor) nodes, multimedia sensor nodes capture high volumes of data and perform far more complex tasks that can be highly power consuming. In this paper, we present the design of energy efficient high resolution camera sensor node, that is capable of capturing a full HD video at 30fps, using off-the-shelf hardware for an event driven video streaming surveillance application. In order to achieve long battery life, we use an energy efficient motion detection and power management mechanism, called sleepyCAM, which uses a lowpower scalar sensor node to detect motion and wake-up a high resolution camera node when needed. We used Libellium Waspmote platform and raspberry pi (RPi) to implement the functionality of the low-power sensor node and the HD camera node, respectively. We validate our work using a baseline setup on a standby RPi that uses scalar sensor for motion detection. The results demonstrate that with the used hardware platform, the power consumption can be reduced by more than 99%.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031460","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8031003/8031434/08031460.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2017.10","startPage":"107","endPage":"113","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2017.10","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Event Driven Video Streaming Surveillance Using SleepyCAM","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"21-23 Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8031460/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17190458","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Event Driven Video Streaming Surveillance Using SleepyCAM","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"0958a107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051046S","chronDate":"21-23 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8031003","isNumber":"8031434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8031003","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8031434","articleId":"8031460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8031462,"authors":[{"name":"M\u00e1rio Marques da Silva","affiliation":["Universidade Autonoma de Lisboa, Lisboa, Lisboa, PT"],"firstName":"M\u00e1rio Marques da","lastName":"Silva"},{"name":"Rui Dinis","affiliation":["Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Lisboa, Lisboa, PT"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Dinis"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0958-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0959-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8031462","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Precoding","MIMO","Frequency-domain analysis","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","equalisers","frequency-domain analysis","interference suppression","iterative methods","matched filters","millimetre wave antenna arrays","MIMO communication","precoding","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband mm-Wave communications","precoding algorithms","MRT","Equal Gain Combiner","EGT","simplified massive MIMO approach","frequency-domain equalization modulations","millimeter wave communications","high propagation free-space path losses","high efficiency amplification","massive MIMO architecture","massive multiple input multiple output system","spectral efficienciy","m-MIMO approach","SC-FDE modulations","zero forcing transmitter","ZFT","maximum ratio transmitter","receive antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","precoding","SC-FDE","5G","Interference Cancellation","mm-Wave"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the use of massive multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) combined with single-carrier with frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) modulations using a precoding approach. Although millimeter wave (mm-Wave) communications are expected to be a key part of 5G, these frequencies present considerable challenges due to high propagation free-space path losses and implementation difficulties. For this reason, it is desirable to have broadband mm-Wave communications with good power and spectral efficiencies that are compatible with high efficiency amplification. In this paper we propose a massive MIMO (m-MIMO) architecture for broadband mm-Wave communications using precoding approach. We consider three different types of precoding algorithms: Zero Forcing Transmitter (ZFT), Maximum Ratio Transmitter (MRT), and Equal Gain Combiner (EGT). The advantage of both MRT and EGT relies on avoiding the computation of pseudo-inverse of matrices. Their performance of MRT and EGT can be very close to the matched filter bound just after a few iterations of a new proposed interference cancellation, even when the number of receive antennas is not very high.","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2017.12","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8031003/8031434/08031462.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2017.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simplified Massive MIMO Approach Using Precoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031462/","displayDocTitle":"A Simplified Massive MIMO Approach Using Precoding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17190451","conferenceDate":"21-23 Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simplified Massive MIMO Approach Using Precoding","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"0958a122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031616S","chronDate":"21-23 Aug. 2017","isNumber":"8031434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8031003","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8031462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8031467,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuhiko Takahashi","affiliation":["Information Systems Design, Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiko","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37277671400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0958-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0959-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8031467","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031467","abstract":"In this study, we investigate the control performance of an adaptive-type feedforward feedback controller using multilayer hypercomplex-valued neural network.

Although this multi-dimensionality offers additional degrees of freedom, it however comes at the cost of higher complexity. To this end, it is envisaged that spatial information associated with user resource allocation will provide a means for an efficient utilization of a dense radio access network (RAN) infrastructure in a proactive and self-optimized manner. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that aims at the utilization of multi-dimensional (MD) radio service maps (RSM) for storing and exploiting position-based information. Requirements, key concepts and functions are described. The potential gains in energy consumption and efficiency of the radio service maps are shown by means of numerical results for an ultra-dense network deployment scenario.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8025354/8031521/08031530.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/CAMAD.2017.8031530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAD.2017.8031530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-dimensional radio service maps for position-based self-organized networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multi-dimensional radio service maps for position-based self-organized networks","htmlLink":"/document/8031530/","publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17174845","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-dimensional radio service maps for position-based self-organized networks","confLoc":"Lund, Sweden","sourcePdf":"a17-tengkvist.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045023S","chronDate":"19-21 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8025354","isNumber":"8031521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8025354","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8031521","articleId":"8031530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8031550,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Fyrbiak","affiliation":["Horst G\u00f6rtz Institute for IT Security, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Fyrbiak","id":"37085471765"},{"name":"Sebastian Strau\u00df","affiliation":["Ruhr-Universitat Bochum, Bochum, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Strau\u00df"},{"name":"Christian Kison","affiliation":["Horst G\u00f6rtz Institute for IT Security, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Kison","id":"37074230600"},{"name":"Sebastian Wallat","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Wallat","id":"37086047306"},{"name":"Malte Elson","affiliation":["Institute of Educational Research, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Malte","lastName":"Elson","id":"37086052410"},{"name":"Nikol Rummel","affiliation":["Institute of Educational Research, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Nikol","lastName":"Rummel","id":"37086057274"},{"name":"Christof Paar","affiliation":["Horst G\u00f6rtz Institute for IT Security, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany","University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Christof","lastName":"Paar","id":"37282655400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1708-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1709-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8031550","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reverse engineering","Hardware","Logic gates","Field programmable gate arrays","Human factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuits","invasive software","reverse engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["technical factors","gate-level netlist analysis","decapsulation","IC landscape","target circuit obfuscation transformations","human factors","complexity quantification","hardware Trojans","design plagiarism","circuit malicious manipulation detection","IP infringement","hardware reverse engineering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware Reverse Engineering"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware reverse engineering: Overview and open challenges","doi":"10.1109/IVSW.2017.8031550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031534","endPage":"94","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 2nd International Verification and Security Workshop (IVSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 2nd International Verification and Security Workshop (IVSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8024489/8031534/08031550.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVSW.2017.8031550","startPage":"88","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031550","abstract":"Hardware reverse engineering is a universal tool for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes. On the one hand, it supports confirmation of IP infringement and detection of circuit malicious manipulations, on the other hand it provides adversaries with crucial information to plagiarize designs, infringe on IP, or implant hardware Trojans into a target circuit. Although reverse engineering is commonplace in practice, the quantification of its complexity is an unsolved problem to date since both technical and human factors have to be accounted for. A sophisticated understanding of this complexity is crucial in order to provide a reasonable threat estimation and to develop sound countermeasures, i.e. obfuscation transformations of the target circuit, to mitigate risks for the modern IC landscape. The contribution of our work is threefold: first, we systematically study the current research branches related to hardware reverse engineering ranging from decapsulation to gate-level netlist analysis. Based on our overview, we formulate several open research questions to scientifically quantify reverse engineering, including technical and human factors. Second, we survey research on problem solving and on the acquisition of expertise and discuss its potential to quantify human factors in reverse engineering. Third, we propose novel directions for future interdisciplinary research encompassing both technical and psychological perspectives that hold the promise to holistically capture the complexity of hardware reverse engineering.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17189416","htmlLink":"/document/8031550/","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Hardware reverse engineering: Overview and open challenges","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware reverse engineering: Overview and open challenges","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP-015-112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.144174S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8024489","isNumber":"8031534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8024489","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8031534","articleId":"8031550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8031552,"authors":[{"name":"Elena Ioana Vatajelu","affiliation":["TIMA, Univ.

While several solutions exist for classical CMOS devices, novel proposals have been recently presented which exploit emerging technologies like magnetic memories. The Spin-Transfer-Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) is a promising choice for future PUFs due to the high variability affecting the electrical resistance of the Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) device in anti-parallel magnetization. Some papers showed that these devices could guarantee high levels of both unclonability and reliability. However, 100% reliability is not yet obtained in those proposals. In this paper we present an effective method to identify the unreliable cells in a PUF implementation. This information is then used to create a zero bit-error-rate PUF scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17189411","htmlLink":"/document/8031552/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Zero bit-error-rate weak PUF based on Spin-Transfer-Torque MRAM memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero bit-error-rate weak PUF based on Spin-Transfer-Torque MRAM memories","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP-017-122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045494S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8024489","isNumber":"8031534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8024489","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8031534","articleId":"8031552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8031556,"authors":[{"name":"Steve Trimberger","affiliation":["Xilinx, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Trimberger","id":"37297561500"},{"name":"Steve McNeil","affiliation":["Xilinx, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"McNeil","id":"37086028957"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1708-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1709-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8031556","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":647},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security of FPGAs in data centers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031556","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Random access memory","Authentication","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","field programmable gate arrays","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA security","data centers","user-deployed logic","FPGA logic","user mode logic","logical separation","physical separation","Xilinx isolation design flow","privileged shell logic","user application logic","user logic behavior detection","user logic behavior handling","current spikes generation","power consumption","FPGA overheating","design checking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Data center","safety","security"]}],"abstract":"Recent deployments of FPGAs as compute resources in data centers have raised security concerns. One concern is how to prevent user-deployed logic in the FPGA from accessing privileged data such as physical addresses or raw network traffic. Addressing this issue uses the concept of `privileged' mode FPGA logic that is kept separate from `user' mode logic. Logical separation can be achieved with design restrictions, physical separation gives a stronger security guarantee. Physical separation can be implemented and enforced using the Xilinx Isolation Design Flow to isolate privileged shell logic from user application logic. A second security concern is the detection and handling of undesirable behavior of user logic. This undesirable behavior includes generation of current spikes, consumption of excessive power or overheating the FPGA or the system. These conditions can be addressed by design checking, and a thorough run-time solution leverages anti-tamper functionality in the FPGA that activates user logic to disable functions when voltage or temperature exceeds preset limits. A third concern is the need to ensure FPGA logic only changes when desired. This concern is addressed using both hard logic and IP that together ensure and verify that the programmable logic does not change during operation.","doi":"10.1109/IVSW.2017.8031556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVSW.2017.8031556","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 2nd International Verification and Security Workshop (IVSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 2nd International Verification and Security Workshop (IVSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8024489/8031534/08031556.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Security of FPGAs in data centers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17189406","htmlLink":"/document/8031556/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security of FPGAs in data centers","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP-021-151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052228S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8024489","isNumber":"8031534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8024489","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8031534","articleId":"8031556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8031559,"authors":[{"name":"Jo Vliegen","affiliation":["IMEC-COSIC-KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jo","lastName":"Vliegen","id":"37540417700"},{"name":"Oscar Reparaz","affiliation":["IMEC-COSIC-KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Reparaz","id":"37071363600"},{"name":"Nele Mentens","affiliation":["IMEC-COSIC-KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Nele","lastName":"Mentens","id":"37272474100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1708-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1709-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8031559","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximizing the throughput of threshold-protected AES-GCM implementations on FPGA","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 2nd International Verification and Security Workshop (IVSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8024489/8031534/08031559.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"145","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 2nd International Verification and Security Workshop (IVSW)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVSW.2017.8031559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031534","doi":"10.1109/IVSW.2017.8031559","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Radiation detectors","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Authentication","Ciphers","Encryption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","random number generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput maximization","threshold-protected AES-GCM implementations","FPGA","side-channel-protected AES-GCM implementations","Boolean masking countermeasure","first-order DPA resistance","pseudorandom number generator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031559","abstract":"In this paper, we push the limits in maximizing the throughput of side-channel-protected AES-GCM implementations on an FPGA.

Connecting devices of everyday use can greatly improve our comfort, but it can also introduce unprecedented security problems. With billions of devices connected there is a huge risk of unauthorized use. In this context, Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are a promising solution since they extract device intrinsic fingerprint that can be used for hardware identification and authentication. Here we present the first fully functional implementation of Oscillator based PUFs on Flash based FPGA. The implementation is presented for the Ring Oscillator based PUF and the Transient Effect Ring Oscillatory based PUF. After explaining those two PUF principles, we give all the necessary design practices to follow to obtain an efficient PUF implementation on Flash FPGA. Finally, we present the characterization of the PUFs and compare it to previous work. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work which deals with the implementation of Oscillator based PUF on Flash FPGAs.

Thus, for high-level graph analysis tasks that rely on the overall arrangement of vertices, drawing conclusions only from one layout is risky. To alleviate the risk, we propose an ensemble framework to capture the commonalities and differences among possible layouts, and help users obtain a comprehensive view of the structure patterns. We leverage a set of layouts that represents the distribution of algorithm outputs. Then, visual features are extracted and analyzed based on various measures of visual similarity. Our framework supports users to analyze individual layouts in the context of the distribution, so that users can quickly identify structures of interest and discover patterns more accurately and comprehensively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to three datasets.","doi":"10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2017.8031595","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8024256/8031561/08031595.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2017.8031595","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis)","startPage":"200","endPage":"209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visualizing the uncertainty induced by graph layout algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Visualizing the uncertainty induced by graph layout algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031595/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8031595/","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17189394","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"18-21 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visualizing the uncertainty induced by graph layout algorithms","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"200_209_yan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133734S","chronDate":"18-21 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8024256","isNumber":"8031561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8024256","xplore-issue":"8031561","articleId":"8031595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8031599,"authors":[{"name":"Donghao Ren","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Barbara"],"firstName":"Donghao","lastName":"Ren","id":"37077502100"},{"name":"Matthew Brehmer","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Brehmer","id":"37719161300"},{"name":"Bongshin Lee","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"lastName":"Bongshin Lee","id":"37293389400"},{"name":"Tobias H\u00f6llerer","affiliation":["University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, US"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"H\u00f6llerer"},{"name":"Eun Kyoung Choe","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University"],"firstName":"Eun Kyoung","lastName":"Choe","id":"37085751692"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5738-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5739-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8773"}],"articleNumber":"8031599","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":848},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tools","Visualization","Data visualization","Manuals","Bars"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","graphical user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ChartAccent","data-driven storytelling","visualization research community","chart annotations","graphical user interfaces"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation (e.g., HCI)]: User Interfaces\u2014Graphical user interfaces (GUI)"]}],"abstract":"Annotation plays an important role in conveying key points in visual data-driven storytelling; it helps presenters explain and emphasize core messages and specific data.

Compressive Sensing (CS) based DOA approaches offer a competitive advantage over the traditional DOA estimation techniques due to their ability to obtain an estimate with measurements collected at a single time instant (i.e. snapshot). However, in reality, CS based methods suffer from grid quantization errors as the source may not exactly align on the discrete grid points. This creates a mismatch between the observation and measurement matrices resulting in an inaccurate estimate. This paper proposes a fundamentally new, recursive algorithm to estimate incoming DOA of a source with zero quantization error. The recursive algorithm is strongly convergent and demonstrates superior performance relative to previous methods. The performance of the algorithm is validated by comparison to the theoretical Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB). An array geometry optimization technique is also proposed that enables the recursive algorithm to achieve the CRLB with just two iterations.","doi":"10.1109/CAMAD.2017.8031615","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8025354/8031521/08031615.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAD.2017.8031615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New high resolution direction of arrival estimation using Compressive Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031615/","displayDocTitle":"New high resolution direction of arrival estimation using Compressive Sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17174824","htmlLink":"/document/8031615/","conferenceDate":"19-21 June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New high resolution direction of arrival estimation using Compressive Sensing","confLoc":"Lund, Sweden","sourcePdf":"a21-biswas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10092S","chronDate":"19-21 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8025354","isNumber":"8031521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8025354","xplore-issue":"8031521","articleId":"8031615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8031619,"authors":[{"name":"Evangelos Vlachos","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Engineering and Informatics, University of Patras & C.T.I, Greece"],"firstName":"Evangelos","lastName":"Vlachos","id":"38262734100"},{"name":"Aris S.

Road safety and traffic efficiency services will be significantly upgraded through seamlessly interconnected devices, while latency decrease will most likely allow autonomous driving to become a commodity, available to everyone. This technology will have a huge societal and economical impact, since it will render severe traffic accidents, long commute times and increased energy consumption obsolete. Current vehicular communication systems are usually equipped with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transceivers that operate in suboptimal modes for the upcoming 5G standards. The problem originates in the existing intercarrier interference (ICI) on the receiver end, often partially tackled by integrated successive interference cancellation (OSIC) architectures. However, for decreasing complexity, system designers attempt to mitigate ICI by considering only a small number or sub-carriers, leading to error floor introduction and unacceptable bit-error-rates (BER). This paper presents an OSIC-based solution for cancelling interference in OFDM systems operating over specific conditions such as doubly selective channels. The experimental results indicated that the proposed equalizer outperforms all existing non-banded ICI cancellation methods, by achieving lower BER despite operating in a resource-savvy manner.","doi":"10.1109/CAMAD.2017.8031619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAD.2017.8031619","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8025354/8031521/08031619.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous driving in 5G: Mitigating interference in OFDM-based vehicular communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031619/","conferenceDate":"19-21 June 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous driving in 5G: Mitigating interference in OFDM-based vehicular communications","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17174806","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8031619/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous driving in 5G: Mitigating interference in OFDM-based vehicular communications","confLoc":"Lund, Sweden","sourcePdf":"a25-vlachos.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051568S","chronDate":"19-21 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8025354","isNumber":"8031521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8025354","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8031521","articleId":"8031619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8031628,"authors":[{"name":"Tewelde Degefa Assefa","affiliation":["Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (ICS-FORTH), Heraklion, Crete, Greece","University of Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Tewelde Degefa","lastName":"Assefa","id":"37085873528"},{"name":"Rashedul Hoque","affiliation":["Cyprus Telecommunications Authority (CYTA-Hellas), Athens, Greece","University of Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Rashedul","lastName":"Hoque","id":"37085573801"},{"name":"Elias Tragos","affiliation":["Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (ICS-FORTH), Heraklion, Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Tragos","id":"37869360200"},{"name":"Xenofontas Dimitropoulos","affiliation":["Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (ICS-FORTH), Heraklion, Crete, Greece","University of Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Xenofontas","lastName":"Dimitropoulos","id":"38347222100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6302-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6303-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-4873"}],"articleNumber":"8031628","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handover","Mobile radio mobility management","Femtocell networks","Mobile computing","3GPP"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","femtocellular radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","network interfaces","software defined networking","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDN-based local mobility management","X2-interface","mobile broadband","spectral efficiency","coverage area","seamless mobility management scheme","management complexity","coordination complexity","signaling overhead minimization","packet loss","handover delay","software defined networking","3GPP X2-based local mobility handling mechanism","SDN-based architecture","enterprise femtocell network","handover latency minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","RAN","Femtocells","HeNB","X2-interface","Mobility Management","SDN","SDN Controller"]}],"abstract":"Femtocell technology has been recognized as a potential solution to face the explosive growth of mobile broadband by boosting the spectral efficiency and coverage area.

Some of the challenges include increased coordination and management complexity, signaling overhead, higher packet loss and handover delay due to frequent handovers. Software Defined Networking (SDN) has been proposed as a potential solution to address some of these challenges. In this work, we study the current 3GPP X2-based local mobility handling mechanism, and propose an SDN-based architecture that integrates the SDN paradigm into an X2-based local mobility management scheme in an enterprise femtocell network.

Then, we discuss two specific topics within the project. The first is the use of stochastic modeling for millimeter wave (mmWave) systems, which are expected to be part of 5G networks. Our modeling enables network anticipation, resulting in an estimation of the coverage probability of mmWave, including coverage with non-line-of-sight (NLOS) mmWave beams. In the second research topic, we address the use of scalable and dynamic transmission time interval (TTI) for scenarios with a mix of different traffic types.

Due to the vast bandwidth available in the unlicensed light spectrum, the ascent of LED-based lighting, inherent security and EM benefits, OWC can be regarded as an attractive alternative to commonly available RF-based communication, specifically Wi-Fi. With its importance grows the need for properly matched system models and tools for exploration of the OWC-specific design space in order to predict system performance under real-life conditions. Therefore, a simulation model for the discrete event-based simulation framework OMNeT++ was created, which precisely models transmissions on the physical level in LOS scenarios and enables quantitative impact analysis of changes in either the optical front-ends or the simulated scenario, e.g. field of view (FOV), position and orientation of transmitter and receiver. The physical characteristics of the simulation model have been verified against measurements performed with an actual OWC system. In order to illustrate design space exploration capabilities of our simulation model, four case studies are presented involving changes to transmission aspects, e.g. modulation scheme or type of FEC, or the utilized protocols. Each demonstrates the possibility to quantify the impact of static and dynamic parameter changes on the resulting system performance parameters, such as throughput and covered area.","doi":"10.1109/CAMAD.2017.8031636","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8025354/8031521/08031636.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAD.2017.8031636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031521","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance estimation of indoor optical wireless communication systems using OMNeT++","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance estimation of indoor optical wireless communication systems using OMNeT++","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031636/","conferenceDate":"19-21 June 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17174847","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8031636/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance estimation of indoor optical wireless communication systems using OMNeT++","confLoc":"Lund, Sweden","sourcePdf":"a40-pfefferkorn.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.142947S","chronDate":"19-21 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8025354","isNumber":"8031521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8025354","xplore-issue":"8031521","articleId":"8031636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8031644,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Two versions of the Medium-Transparent MAC (MT-MAC) protocols have been presented to this day. The first is the pure Medium Transparent MAC (MT-MAC) that assigns optical capacity for equal time intervals to every Remote Antenna Unit (RAU) of the network. The second version is the Client-Weighted Medium Transparent MAC (CW-MT-MAC). The latter assigns wavelengths based on the number of active users that reside within each RAU, and for time proportionate to the latter, with the purpose of providing capacity fairness among the users. The CWMT-MAC exhibits greater performance and equalization regarding the achieved throughput and packet delay in the user basis regardless of the user population distribution in the network's RAUs. The results conclude that the medium transparent MAC protocols can operate successfully over converged Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) networks, confirming their flexibility and their capacity to form Wireless Local Area Networks in the 60GHz band even without Line-Of-Sight (LOS). In addition, the results show that the CW-MT-MAC alleviates the inter-user standard deviation in terms of throughput and packet delay, thus establishing its equalization and fairness properties.","doi":"10.1109/CAMAD.2017.8031644","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8025354/8031521/08031644.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAD.2017.8031644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On converged Medium-Transparent MAC protocols for mm-wave fiber-wireless networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Optical fibers","Optical network units","Media Access Protocol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","equalisers","free-space optical communication","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["converged medium-transparent MAC protocol","mm-wave fiber-wireless network","access control protocol","optical capacity","remote antenna unit","client-weighted medium transparent MAC","equalization","radio-over-fiber network","RoF network","wireless local area network","CW-MT-MAC protocols","interuser standard deviation","fairness properties"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Medium-Transparent MAC","Client-Weighted vs. Round-robin capacity assigment","Radio-over-Fiber Network","mmwave","optical wireless"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"On converged Medium-Transparent MAC protocols for mm-wave fiber-wireless networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8031644/","publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"19-21 June 2017","accessionNumber":"17174848","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On converged Medium-Transparent MAC protocols for mm-wave fiber-wireless networks","confLoc":"Lund, Sweden","sourcePdf":"a48-kalfas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049174S","chronDate":"19-21 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8025354","isNumber":"8031521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8025354","xplore-issue":"8031521","articleId":"8031644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8031648,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Large number of Base Station (BS) antennas in massive MIMO at one hand has caused the performance of linear precoders to be near-optimal and at the other hand has increased their complexity due to the need for the inversion of matrices with large dimensions. To avoid this complexity, approximate inversion methods based on Neumann Series have been proposed. However, in this work, we propose an architecture for Zero Forcing (ZF) precoder based on the Neumann Series approximate inversion that further reduces the complexity by replacing matrix-matrix multiplications with matrix-vector multiplications. The proposed method is motivated by the fact that the final output of a precoder is a vector of precoded data not the precoding matrix itself. Finally we present the implementation results on a Xilinx Virtex-7 XC7VX485T and also Kintex-7 410T FPGAs and compare the achieved results with similar designs. These results show that our architecture achieves higher throughput with a lower complexity providing the same accuracy compared to the reported designs to-date.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8025354/8031521/08031648.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","doi":"10.1109/CAMAD.2017.8031648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAD.2017.8031648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-throughput low-complexity VLSI architecture for ZF precoding in massive MIMO","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Precoding","Computer architecture","MIMO","Antennas","Bit error rate","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","matrix inversion","matrix multiplication","MIMO communication","precoding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-throughput low-complexity VLSI architecture","massive MIMO system","massive multiple-input multiple-output system","base station antennas","linear precoder performance","matrix inversion","Neumann Series","zero forcing precoder","matrix-vector multiplications","precoding matrix","ZF precoding","Xilinx Virtex-7 XC7VX485T","Kintex-7 410T FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"A high-throughput low-complexity VLSI architecture for ZF precoding in massive MIMO","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8031648/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17174831","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"19-21 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-throughput low-complexity VLSI architecture for ZF precoding in massive MIMO","confLoc":"Lund, Sweden","sourcePdf":"a6-mirfarshbafan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076216S","chronDate":"19-21 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8025354","isNumber":"8031521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8025354","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8031521","articleId":"8031648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8031650,"authors":[{"name":"Amirreza Kabiri","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Amirreza","lastName":"Kabiri","id":"37086023483"},{"name":"Mohammad Javad Emadi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Javad","lastName":"Emadi","id":"37276510200"},{"name":"Majid Nasiri Khormuji","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Sweden AB, Stockholm"],"firstName":"Majid Nasiri","lastName":"Khormuji","id":"37643215400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6302-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6303-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-4873"}],"articleNumber":"8031650","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Coherence","MIMO","Silicon carbide","Uplink","OFDM","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","energy conservation","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","multiuser channels","multiuser detection","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SOMA-massive MIMO system performance","multiuser detection","uplink multiuser massive multiple-input multiple-output system","minimum mean-square error channel estimation","MMSE channel estimation","semiorthogonal multiple-access scheme","maximum ratio combining","MRC","data detection","single-user detection","successive interference cancellation","energy efficiencies","spectral efficiencies"]}],"abstract":"We study an uplink multi-user massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system employing Semi-Orthogonal Multiple-Access (SOMA) scheme.

Large amount of research has been dedicated for SM performance compared to the current transmission systems. However, the problem of bit to symbol mapping in SM has been rarely investigated in the literature. Unlike other systems, the applied bit to symbol mapping in SM cannot satisfy Gray code principle, which, in turn, degrades the error performance. This article sheds light on this problem as an open research issue. The article starts by exploring the problem, discussing the encountering challenges for potential solutions, and including some expected results, aiming at motivating researchers to handle the problem.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8025354/8031521/08031651.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","doi":"10.1109/CAMAD.2017.8031651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAD.2017.8031651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gray codes for Spatial Modulation systems: An open research issue","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Hamming distance","Modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Reflective binary codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gray codes","modulation coding","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gray codes","spatial modulation systems","SM system","wireless transmission","bit to symbol mapping","open research issue"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Gray codes for Spatial Modulation systems: An open research issue","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8031651/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17174836","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"19-21 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gray codes for Spatial Modulation systems: An open research issue","confLoc":"Lund, Sweden","sourcePdf":"a9-al_sukkar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045495S","chronDate":"19-21 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8025354","isNumber":"8031521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8025354","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8031521","articleId":"8031651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8031876,"authors":[{"name":"Debnath Maji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/8241892/8031876/maji-2739724-small.gif","p":["Debnath Maji (S\u201915) was born in 1990.

analyze the coded multicasting communication in a hybrid environment with mobile nodes. We consider a cellular vehicular network in which vehicles are mobile nodes and obtain contents either from each other (i.e., D2D) or the base station (i.e., D2I). Employing learning theory, we propose a novel dissemination algorithm tailored for coded multicasting communication in a setting with mobile users. On average, simulation experiments reveal 8% decrease in network communication rate compared with previously reported coded multicasting methods.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2751468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8170462/08031878.pdf","startPage":"2694","endPage":"2697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2751468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded Multicasting for Content Dissemination in a Cellular Vehicular Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Coded Multicasting for Content Dissemination in a Cellular Vehicular Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031878/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17414968","htmlLink":"/document/8031878/","volume":"21","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded Multicasting for Content Dissemination in a Cellular Vehicular Network","sourcePdf":"lcomm-khonsari-2751468-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055703S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8170462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170462","articleId":"8031878","onlineDate":"12 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8031883,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Deng","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangzhou Panyu Polytechnic, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8031883/deng-2751503-small.gif","p":["Dan Deng received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, in 2003 and 2008, respectively.

In comparison with traditional frequency division multiplexing based aggregation scheme, the fast Fourier transformation/inverse fast Fourier transformation operations are replaced by simple sign selection and addition, leading to the significant reduction of computational complexity. Moreover, synchronous transmission of both the I/Q waveforms of wireless signals and the control words (CWs) used for the purpose of control and management using the CDM approach is also presented to be compliant with the common public radio interface (CPRI). In a proof-of-concept experiment, we demonstrate the transmission of 48 \u00d7 20 MHz LTE signals with CPRI equivalent data rate of 59 Gb/s, achieving an average error vector magnitude (EVM) of ~3.6% and ~4.3% after 5 and 20 km transmission over standard single-mode fiber (SSMF), respectively. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate the transmission of 32 \u00d7 20 MHz LTE signals together with CPRI-compliant CWs, corresponding to CPRI-equivalent data rate of 39.32 Gb/s, only using single optical wavelength channel with analog bandwidth of ~1.96 GHz.

When the bias current is fixed at 130 mA, the SMSR is larger than 55 dB, which is benefit from the suppressed spatial hole burning, while the SMSR of the equivalent phase shifted DFB laser decreases to 39 dB. The wavelength spacing error between two proposed DFB lasers is measured to be 0.089\u00a0nm compared with the designed value. When temperature is increased from 20\u00a0\u00b0C to 42\u00a0\u00b0C, the presented DFB laser achieves stable single longitudinal mode (SLM) operation with SMSR >51 dB and the wavelength varies from 1562.24 to 1564.6\u00a0nm with a slope of 0.11\u00a0nm/\u00b0C. The s-bent waveguide and sampled grating can be fabricated simply by the common holography exposure and photolithograph technique resulting in a low cost.

Although there have been many methods to perform foreground extraction, most of them are time-consuming, and the trimaps used in the matting step are labeled manually. In this paper, we propose a fast interactive foreground extraction method based on the superpixel GrabCut and image matting. Specifically, we first extract superpixels from a given image and apply GrabCut on them to obtain a raw mask. Due to that the resulting mask border is hard and toothing, we further propose fast and adaptive trimaps (FATs), and construct an FATs-based shared matting for computing a refined mask. Finally, by interactive processing, we can obtain the final foreground. Experimental results on the BSDS500 and alphamatting datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is faster than five representative methods, and performs better than the interactive representative methods in terms of the three evaluation criteria: 1) mean square error; 2) sum of absolute difference; and 3) execution time.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

extrinsic log-likelihood ratio (LLR) computation of a soft-input soft-output equalizer used in a turbo equalization system. The optimum LLRs are obtained by a maximum a posteriori -based equalizer, which may be computationally expensive. Thus, several reduced-complexity equalizers have been proposed. The most promising approach first applies linear minimum mean square error filtering to the channel output and then computes the LLRs based on a scalar Gaussian approximation of the filter output. The resulting LLRs can be viewed as an approximation of the optimum LLRs. In order to improve the approximation, we investigate the computation of the LLRs based on a vector Gaussian approximation of the filter output, which incorporates the correlation between the estimated symbols after filtering. Surprisingly, it turns out that both approaches, although their derivation is different, give the same LLRs. We verify this remarkable result through an analytical proof and bit error ratio simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031962/","volume":"24","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8031962/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17213576","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Does Vector Gaussian Approximation After LMMSE Filtering Improve the LLR Quality?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Does Vector Gaussian Approximation After LMMSE Filtering Improve the LLR Quality?","sourcePdf":"lsp-haselmayr-2751570-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109693S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"8048073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8048073","articleId":"8031962","onlineDate":"12 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8031964,"authors":[{"name":"Shi Pan","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8031964/pan-2751565-small.gif","p":["Shi Pan received the master\u2019s degree from the College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2012, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

In this case, to control the performance degradation due to the uncertainties, we maximize the data rate of secondary users (SUs) by considering maximum allowable interference constraints and total power budget of SUs. To solve this problem, we design a controller for a switched affine system with state constraint. This system is based on a distributed projected dynamic system in accordance with the classical distributed convex optimization model for the power allocation and dynamic property of the Nash equilibrium. The robust controller design is on the basis of Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality to better realize the original power allocation from the control perspective. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to solve the aforementioned problem by this kind of approach under the control frame, which is more practical for the realization in CRNs. Simulation results are provided to show the validation of the effectiveness of this approach in comparison with iterative water filling algorithm and the worst-case method.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2751565","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08031964.pdf","startPage":"18778","endPage":"18792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2751565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Power Allocation for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks: A Switched Affine Based Control Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031964/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Power Allocation for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks: A Switched Affine Based Control Approach","volume":"5","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17266491","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8031964/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571209"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Robust Power Allocation for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks: A Switched Affine Based Control Approach","sourcePdf":"access-zhao-2751565-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165206S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8031964","onlineDate":"12 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8031975,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenqiang Yong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhenqiang","lastName":"Yong","orcid":"0000-0003-2121-561X","id":"37086251819"},{"name":"Xiaoyan Xiang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyan","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37085778394"},{"name":"Chen Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085770662"},{"name":"Jianyi Meng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jianyi","lastName":"Meng","id":"37085616657"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"8031975","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1165},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031975","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mirrors","Transistors","Leakage currents","Power demand","Inverters","Layout","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","current mirrors","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient level","subthreshold input signal","above-threshold output signal","dual current mirror structure","voltage conversion","target voltage","wide-range voltage level shifter","power 88.4 pW","voltage 0.2 V to 1.1 V","voltage 0.3 V","time 66.48 ns","energy 72.31 fJ"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Level shifter (LS)","subthreshold operation","wide range voltage conversion","Wilson current mirror (CM)"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents an energy-efficient level shifter (LS) to convert a subthreshold input signal to an above-threshold output signal.

The core of the framework is a Software Defined Radio (SDR)-based Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transceiver that we validated extensively by means of simulations, interoperability tests, and, ultimately, by conducting a field test. Being SDR-based, the transceiver offers important benefits: It provides access to all data down to and including the physical layer, allowing for a better understanding of the system. Based on open and programmable hardware and software, the transceiver is completely transparent and all implementation details can be studied and, if needed, modified. Finally, it enables a seamless switch between simulations and experiments and, thus, helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Comparing the transceiver's performance with independent results from simulations and experiments, we underline its potential to be used as a tool for further studies of IEEE 802.11p networks both in field operational tests as well as for simulation-based development of novel physical layer solutions. To make the framework accessible to fellow researchers and to allow reproduction of the results, we released it under an Open Source license.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031977/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2017","volume":"17","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"17683825","publicationDate":"1 May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8031977/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance Assessment of IEEE\u00a0802.11p with an Open Source SDR-Based Prototype","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Assessment of IEEE\u00a0802.11p with an Open Source SDR-Based Prototype","sourcePdf":"tmc-dressler-2751474-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101767S","chronDate":"May 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"8330738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8330738","articleId":"8031977","onlineDate":"12 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8031986,"authors":[{"name":"Pilar Holgado","affiliation":["Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid Avenida Complutense, 30, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/8960487/8031986/holga-2751478-small.gif","p":["Pilar Holgado received the degree in computer engineering, in 2009 and the MSc degree in computer science and telecommunications, specializing in communication networks and embedded systems, in 2011 from Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (UAM).

We consider the hidden states as similar phases of a particular type of attack. As a result, it can be easily adapted to multistep attacks and foresee the next steps of an attacker. To achieve this goal, a preliminary off-line training phase based on observations will be required. These observations are obtained by matching the IDS alert information with a database previously built for this purpose using a clusterization method from the CVE global database to avoid overfitting. The training model is performed using both unsupervised and supervised algorithms. Once the training is completed and probability matrices are computed, the prediction module compute the best state sequence based on the state probability for each step of the multistep attack in progress using the Viterbi and forward-backward algorithms. The training model includes the mean number of alerts and the number of alerts in progress to assist in obtaining the final attack probability. The model is analyzed for DDoS phases because it is a great problem in all Internet services. The proposed method is validated into a virtual DDoS scenario using current vulnerabilities.

The main differences between chopped amplifiers and standard offset uncompensated ones are analyzed in terms of EMI susceptibility, achieving three main results. First, a new model is developed to show how chopping influences the amplifier susceptibility in a broadband sense, demonstrating that chopped OpAMPs generate a lower amount of EMI-induced offset from the nonlinear distortion with respect to standard ones because of the topological differences between the respective input stages. Second, a model to predict the effects of EMI appearing at the multiples of the chopping frequency is derived, showing that chopped OpAMPs can experience dc shift peaks because of the linear distortion of the disturbances whose frequencies hit the even multiples of the chopping frequency. Finally, the simultaneous presence of the technological offset and the offset produced by the nonlinear and the linear distortion of EMI in chopped OpAMP is illustrated by means of dedicated EMI susceptibility measurements performed on several devices designed to validate the analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2017.2729781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2017.2729781","startPage":"478","endPage":"486","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel7/15/8094991/08031992.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8094991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Robustness of CMOS-Chopped Operational Amplifiers to Conducted Electromagnetic Interferences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"On the Robustness of CMOS-Chopped Operational Amplifiers to Conducted Electromagnetic Interferences","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2017","volume":"60","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8031992/","accessionNumber":"17335759","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8031992/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004955","fundingName":"Austrian Research Promotion Agency, FFG","grantNumber":"846579"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006548","fundingName":"Carinthian Economic Promotion Fund, KWF","grantNumber":"KWF-1521/26876/38867"},{"fundingName":"Infineon Technologies Villach (AG)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Robustness of CMOS-Chopped Operational Amplifiers to Conducted Electromagnetic Interferences","sourcePdf":"temc-lavarda-2729781-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064943S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"8094991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8094991","articleId":"8031992","onlineDate":"12 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8031997,"authors":[{"name":"Raghunandan M.

In current multiband CA-OFDM wireless networks, all component carriers use the same pilot density, which is designed for poor channel environments. This leads to unnecessary pilot overhead in good channel conditions and performance degradation in the worst channel conditions. We propose adaptation of pilot spacing and power using a codebook-based approach, where the transmitter and the receiver exchange information about the fading characteristics of the channel over a short period of time, which are stored as entries in a channel profile codebook. We present a heuristic algorithm that maximizes the achievable rate by finding the optimal pilot spacing and power from a set of candidate pilot configurations. We also analyze the computational complexity of our proposed algorithm and the feedback overhead. We describe methods to minimize the computation and feedback requirements for our algorithm in multiband CA scenarios and present simulation results in typical terrestrial and air-to-ground/air-to-air nonstationary channels. Our results show that significant performance gains can be achieved when adopting adaptive pilot spacing and power allocation in nonstationary channels.

A data acquisition hardware is designed for high-resolution sampling of phonocardiogram (PCG), photoplethysmogram, and electrocardiogram (ECG). PCG and ECG perform as the proximal timing reference to obtain PTT and PAT indices, respectively. In order to derive a BP estimator model, a calibration procedure, including a supervised physical exercise, is conducted for each individual, which causes changes in their BP, and then, a number of reference BPs are measured alongside the acquisition of the signals per subject. It is suggested to use a force-sensing resistor that is placed under the cuff of the BP reference device to mark the exact moments of reference BP measurements, which are corresponding to the inflation of the cuff. Additionally, a novel BP estimator nonlinear model, based on the theory of elastic tubes, is introduced to estimate the BP using PTT/PAT values precisely. The proposed method is evaluated on 32 subjects. Using the PTT index, the correlation coefficients for SBP and DBP estimation are 0.89 and 0.84, respectively. Using the PAT index, the correlation coefficients for SBP and DBP estimation are 0.95 and 0.84, respectively. The results show that the proposed method, exploiting the introduced nonlinear model with the use of PAT index or PTT index, provides a reliable estimation of SBP and DBP.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2017.2745081","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/8089055/08032000.pdf","startPage":"3299","endPage":"3308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2017.2745081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8089055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation of Healthy Subjects Using Pulse Transit Time and Arrival Time","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8032000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8032000/","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation of Healthy Subjects Using Pulse Transit Time and Arrival Time","volume":"66","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17338321","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8032000/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation of Healthy Subjects Using Pulse Transit Time and Arrival Time","sourcePdf":"tim-shabany-2745081-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072314S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"8089055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8089055","articleId":"8032000","onlineDate":"12 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8032474,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Jiang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8258580/8032474/jiang-2751555-small.gif","p":["Hao Jiang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and information engineering from the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, in 2012, and 2015, respectively.

A spherical wavefront is assumed in the proposed model instead of the plane wavefront assumption used in the conventional MIMO channel model. Using the proposed V2V channel model, we first derive the closed-form expressions for the joint and marginal probability density functions of the angle of departure at the transmitter and angle of arrival at the receiver in the azimuth and elevation planes. We additionally analyze the time and frequency cross-correlation functions for different propagation paths. In the proposed model, we derive the expression of the Doppler spectrum due to the relative motion between the mobile transmitter and mobile receiver. The results show that the proposed 3-D channel model is in close agreement with previously reported results, thereby validating the generalization of the proposed model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8032474/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","volume":"66","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17519946","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8032474/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel 3-D Massive MIMO Channel Model for Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication Environments","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"national key research and development plan","grantNumber":"2016YFB0502202"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC projects","grantNumber":"61571105, 61501109 and 61601119"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu NSF project","grantNumber":"BK20140646"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"scientific research foundation of graduate school of Southeast University","grantNumber":"YBJJ1655"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel 3-D Massive MIMO Channel Model for Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication Environments","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhang-2751555-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092934S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8258580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8258580","articleId":"8032474","onlineDate":"12 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8032479,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunik Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8081776/8032479/hkim-2734910-small.gif","p":["Hyunik Kim (M\u201915) received the B.S. degree from Handong Global University, Pohang, South Korea, in 2013, and the M.S. degree from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea, in 2015.","He is currently a Circuit Engineer with the Mixed-Signal Core Group, Samsung Electronics, Inc., Hwasung, South Korea, where he is responsible for analog circuit design for clock generators."]},"firstName":"Hyunik","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0001-5065-8351","id":"37085710656"},{"name":"Yongjo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8081776/8032479/ykim-2734910-small.gif","p":["Yongjo Kim received the B.S. degree from the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","His current research interests include low-noise and low-power ADPLL."]},"firstName":"Yongjo","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0001-5204-2251","id":"37085705795"},{"name":"Taeik Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8081776/8032479/tkim-2734910-small.gif","p":["Taeik Kim (S\u201901\u2013M\u201915\u2013SM\u201916) received the B.S. and M.S degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.","He was with Intel, Hillsboro, OR, USA, Motorola, Austin, TX, USA, and Freescale, Austin, where he was involved in product development and research positions.

Here, we demonstrate that the better extraction of force-related features from multichannel LFPs improves the accuracy of force decoding. We propose that applying canonical correlation analysis (CCA) filter on the envelopes of separate frequency bands (band-specific CCA) separates non-task related information from the LFPs. The decoding accuracy of the continuous force signal based on the proposed method were compared with three feature reduction methods: 1) band-specific principal component analysis (band-specific PCA) method that extract the components which leads to maximum variance from the envelopes of different frequency bands; 2) correlation coefficient-based (CC-based) feature reduction that selects the best features from the envelopes sorted based on the absolute correlation coefficient between each envelope and the target force signal; and 3) mutual information-based (MI-based) feature reduction that selects the best features from the envelopes sorted based on the mutual information between each envelope and output force signal. The band-specific CCA method outperformed band-specific PCA with 11% improvement, CC-based feature reduction with 16% improvement, and MI-based feature reduction with 18% improvement. In the online brain control experiments, the real-time decoded force signal from the 16-channel LFPs based on the proposed method was used to move a mechanical arm. Two rats performed 88 trials in seven sessions to control the mechanical arm based on the 16-channel LFPs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7333/8249505/08032482.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"25","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2751579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2751579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8249505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8032482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brain Control of an External Device by Extracting the Highest Force-Related Contents of Local Field Potentials in Freely Moving Rats","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Decoding","Feature extraction","Correlation","Principal component analysis","Task analysis","Animals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","brain","feature extraction","filtering theory","medical signal processing","neurophysiology","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain control","external device","force-related contents","freely moving rats","local field potential signal","force-related feature extraction","multichannel LFP","force decoding","canonical correlation analysis filter","continuous force signal","frequency reduction methods","band-specific principal component analysis","correlation coefficient-based feature reduction","absolute correlation coefficient","mutual information-based feature reduction","band-specific CCA method","band-specific PCA","real-time decoded force signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Force decoding","canonical correlation analysis","brain-machine interface","local field potential"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Algorithms","Animals","Artifacts","Artificial Limbs","Biomechanical Phenomena","Brain-Computer Interfaces","Male","Models, Theoretical","Motor Cortex","Principal Component Analysis","Psychomotor Performance","Rats","Rats, Wistar","Reproducibility of Results"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8032482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Brain Control of an External Device by Extracting the Highest Force-Related Contents of Local Field Potentials in Freely Moving Rats","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8032482/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17454516","pubMedId":"28920903","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Cognitive Sciences and Technologies Council of Iran","grantNumber":"119"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brain Control of an External Device by Extracting the Highest Force-Related Contents of Local Field Potentials in Freely Moving Rats","sourcePdf":"tnsre-daliri-2751579-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107974S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"8249505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8249505","articleId":"8032482","onlineDate":"12 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8032486,"authors":[{"name":"Kunpeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Automation Engineering, East China Jiaotong University, Nanchang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/8425800/8032486/zhang-2735360-small.gif","p":["Kunpeng Zhang received the B.S. degree in automation and the M.S. degree in control theory and control engineering from East China Jiaotong University, Nanchang, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

By treating the multidimensional adverse states as changes of a single faults evolution factor, we build a reduced dimensional MIMO evolution model satisfying persistently exciting condition. In the presence of coupled faults, a nominal feed-forward controller guarantees the reliability of the closed-loop stability. Then, a fast proportional integral fault estimator is employed to predict the system resilience within a few microseconds. Under system uncertainties, a fault tolerant control scheme, including a unified robust adaptive controller, is designed to enhance the reliability. Applying the conditions of the globally asymptotically stability, the convergence of the resilient system is rigorously proved. A case study is performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Evolution Model-Based Coupled Fault Estimation and Adaptive Control With High-Speed Train Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2017.2735360","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/87/8425800/08032486.pdf","startPage":"1552","endPage":"1566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2017.2735360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8425800","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8032486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8032486/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Evolution Model-Based Coupled Fault Estimation and Adaptive Control With High-Speed Train Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8032486/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18006051","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61490703"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004479","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province, China","grantNumber":"20132BAB201042"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund of East China Jiaotong University","grantNumber":"12DQ04"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004193","fundingName":"Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics through the Visiting Professorship Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Evolution Model-Based Coupled Fault Estimation and Adaptive Control With High-Speed Train Applications","sourcePdf":"tcst-jiang-2735360-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16335S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"8425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8425800","articleId":"8032486","onlineDate":"12 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8032488,"authors":[{"name":"Kentaro Kobayashi","affiliation":["Institute of Materials and Systems for Sustainability, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8258580/8032488/kobay-2751472-small.gif","p":["Kentaro Kobayashi was born in Mie, Japan, in 1983.

In addition, the proposed receiver provides the error covariance information of the received state feedback for the control layer. The recursive structure of the receiver and state observer is simple and suitable for the feedback control loop. The improvement in the channel error probability is supported by the control accuracy and vice versa.

The main innovation behind this methodology lies in the use of deep learning models for the problem of jointly classifying unregistered mammogram views and respective segmentation maps of breast lesions (i.e., masses and micro-calcifications). This is a holistic methodology that can classify a whole mammographic exam, containing the CC and MLO views and the segmentation maps, as opposed to the classification of individual lesions, which is the dominant approach in the field. We also demonstrate that the proposed system is capable of using the segmentation maps generated by automated mass and micro-calcification detection systems, and still producing accurate results. The semi-automated approach (using manually defined mass and micro-calcification segmentation maps) is tested on two publicly available data sets (INbreast and DDSM), and results show that the volume under ROC surface (VUS) for a 3-class problem (normal tissue, benign, and malignant) is over 0.9, the area under ROC curve (AUC) for the 2-class \u201cbenign versus malignant\u201d problem is over 0.9, and for the 2-class breast screening problem (malignancy versus normal/benign) is also over 0.9.

The key contribution of this paper is to investigate the UL signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) performance using the DNA-GA analysis. In particular, the SIR is modeled as a ratio of two random variables (RVs), representing the signal power and the aggregate interference power, respectively. The signal power is further characterized by a product of two RVs, i.e., a lognormal RV and an RV with an arbitrary distribution. The former RV comes from a common assumption of lognormal shadow fading, and the latter one takes the rest of random factors into account, such as random user positions, arbitrary types of multi-path fading, and so on. The aggregate interference power is approximated by an RV with a power lognormal distribution. The proposed DNA-GA analysis has several desirable features: 1) it naturally considers lognormal shadow fading; 2) it can treat arbitrary shape and/or size of cell coverage areas; 3) it can handle non-uniform user distributions; 4) it can cope with any type of multi-path fading; and 5) it can be applied to multi-antenna base stations. These features make the DNA-GA analysis very useful for the network performance analysis of the 5th generation systems with general cell deployment and user distribution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8032493/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","volume":"66","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17519922","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8032493/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DNA-GA: A Tractable Approach for Performance Analysis of Uplink Cellular Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DNA-GA: A Tractable Approach for Performance Analysis of Uplink Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-ding-2751552-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.293535S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8258580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8258580","articleId":"8032493","onlineDate":"12 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8032503,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Arshad Nasir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8103134/8032503/nasir-2749568-small.gif","p":["Ali Arshad Nasir (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913) received the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications engineering from Australian National University (ANU), Australia, in 2013.

Moreover, densification of such networks will make the physical layer more vulnerable to cyber attacks by potential multi-antenna eavesdroppers. To address these issues, this paper considers transmit time-switching (TS) mode, in which energy and information signals are transmitted separately in time by the base station (BS). This protocol is not only easy to implement but also delivers the opportunity for multi-purpose beamforming, in which energy beamformers can be used to jam eavesdroppers during wireless power transfer. In the presence of imperfect channel estimation and multiantenna eavesdroppers, the energy and information beamformers and the transmit TS ratio are jointly optimized to maximize the worst-case user secrecy rate subject to energy constrained users' harvested energy thresholds and a BS transmit power budget. New robust path-following algorithms, which involve one simple convex quadratic program at each iteration are proposed for computational solutions of this difficult optimization problem and also the problem of secure energy efficiency maximization. The latter adds further complexity due to additional optimization variables appearing in the denominator of the secrecy rate function. Numerical results confirm that the performance of the proposed computational solutions is robust against channel uncertainties.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/8103134/8032503-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8032503/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","volume":"16","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"17372694","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8032503/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Secure and Energy-Efficient Beamforming for Simultaneous Information and Energy Transfer","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004055","fundingName":"King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals under a Start-up Research Project","grantNumber":"#SR161003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council\u2019s Discovery Projects","grantNumber":"DP130104617"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"U.K. Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship","grantNumber":"RF1415/14/22"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/P019374/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1702808 and ECCS-1647198"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Secure and Energy-Efficient Beamforming for Simultaneous Information and Energy Transfer","sourcePdf":"twc-duong-2749568-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.311079S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8103134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8103134","articleId":"8032503","onlineDate":"12 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8034868,"authors":[{"name":"Ana-Mirela Rotopanescu","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information Technologies, \u201cGheorghe Asachi\u201d Technical University, Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Ana-Mirela","lastName":"Rotopanescu","id":"37086195795"},{"name":"Lucian Trifina","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information Technologies, \u201cGheorghe Asachi\u201d Technical University, Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Lucian","lastName":"Trifina","id":"37546632100"},{"name":"Daniela Tarniceriu","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information Technologies, \u201cGheorghe Asachi\u201d Technical University, Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Daniela","lastName":"Tarniceriu","id":"37595383500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0674-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0673-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0675-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8034868","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Iterative decoding","Turbo codes","Receiving antennas","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","mobile antennas","mobile communication","modulation coding","quadrature amplitude modulation","receiving antennas","space-time codes","transmitting antennas","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft estimates","space-time turbo codes","M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation","high QAM order","mobile communication system performance","doubly iterative decoding scheme","transmit antennas","receive antennas","decoder","coded symbols"]}],"abstract":"Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) is an important modulation scheme with many practical applications, including current and future wireless technologies.

The fairness condition is formulated as a minimal data condition at SUs. A relaxed version of the RA-problem is first reviewed without adopting the fairness and then a heuristic algorithm is proposed based on the results obtained for the relaxed problem. Computer simulation results illustrate that the proposed heuristic algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems (ISSCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8023732/8034855/08034871.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2017 International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems (ISSCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISSCS.2017.8034871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCS.2017.8034871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8034855","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8034871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fair resource allocation in downlink OFDM-based cognitive radio networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","Radio frequency","Downlink","Heuristic algorithms","Base stations","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","optimisation","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fair resource allocation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","downlink OFDM-based cognitive radio networks","downlink resource allocation problem","secondary user capacity","primary users","heuristic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8034871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Fair resource allocation in downlink OFDM-based cognitive radio networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8034871/","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17174740","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"13-14 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair resource allocation in downlink OFDM-based cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Iasi, Romania","sourcePdf":"010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054033S","chronDate":"13-14 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8023732","isNumber":"8034855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8023732","xplore-issue":"8034855","articleId":"8034871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8034889,"authors":[{"name":"Doru Florin Chiper","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Technical University \u201cGh.

However, existing Cloud service monitoring methods are typically inapplicable in case the targeted service parameters are inaccessible, e.g., Cloud Service Providers do not allow external access to some service parameters for varied reasons (proprietary IPR, privacy issues, security concerns or simply access difficulties). Hence, alternate Cloud service monitoring approaches are needed to address this issue. Nonetheless, Cloud services are not provided in isolation and very often share common resources with other services that naturally introduces service dependencies between different services. In this paper, we propose a novel Cloud service monitoring approach which targets such dependencies to conduct indirect monitoring of inaccessible Cloud service parameters by using monitoring information collected from other Cloud services. The proposed monitoring approach can also assess the reliability of the monitored result. The presented case study validates the applicability of the proposed indirect monitoring approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8031413/8034950/08034964.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"34","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)","doi":"10.1109/SCC.2017.13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2017.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8034950","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8034964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"deQAM: A Dependency Based Indirect Monitoring Approach for Cloud Services","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Cloud computing","Reliability","Secure storage","Encryption","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud service monitoring methods","targeted service parameters","monitoring information","inaccessible Cloud service parameters","Cloud service monitoring approach","service dependencies","Cloud Service Providers","indirect monitoring approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Service Security","Service Security Assurance","Service Monitoring","Cloud Services"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8034964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"deQAM: A Dependency Based Indirect Monitoring Approach for Cloud Services","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8034964/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17190533","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"25-30 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"deQAM: A Dependency Based Indirect Monitoring Approach for Cloud Services","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"2005a027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110586S","chronDate":"25-30 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8031413","isNumber":"8034950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8031413","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8034950","articleId":"8034964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8034971,"authors":[{"name":"Hongchao Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan, China"],"firstName":"Hongchao","lastName":"Li","id":"37086127288"},{"name":"Jianxun Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan, China"],"firstName":"Jianxun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292080900"},{"name":"Buqing Cao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan, China"],"firstName":"Buqing","lastName":"Cao","id":"38103977200"},{"name":"Mingdong Tang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan, China"],"firstName":"Mingdong","lastName":"Tang","id":"37534667600"},{"name":"Xiaoqing Liu","affiliation":["University of Arkansas Fayetteville, Fayetteville, AR, US"],"firstName":"Xiaoqing","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Bing Li","affiliation":["Intenational School of Software, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Li","id":"37085850509"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2005-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2004-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2006-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2474-2473"}],"articleNumber":"8034971","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mashups","Quality of service","Probability distribution","Matrix decomposition","Information services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Mashup creation","novel Web API recommendation method","tag factor integration","cooccurence factor integration","topic factor integration","popularity factor integration","invocation times","service repositories"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["tag","relational topic model","popularity","factorization machines","Web APIs recommendation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8034971","abstract":"With the rapid development of Web APIs, selection of the suitable Web APIs from the service repositories for users to build Mashup applications becomes more and more difficult.

In this paper, we propose a novel Web API recommendation method, which integrates tag, topic, co-occurrence, and popularity factors to recommend Web APIs for Mashup creation. This method, firstly exploits the enriched tags and topics information of Mashups and Web APIs derived by the relational topic model to calculate the similarity between Web APIs and the similarity between Mashups. Secondly, it uses the invocation times and category information of Web APIs to derive their popularity. Thirdly, multi-dimensional information, such as similar Mashups, similar Web APIs, co-occurrence and popularity of Web APIs, are modeled by factorization machines to predict and recommend top-k similar, diverse, relevant Web APIs for a target Mashup. Finally, we conduct a set of experiments, and experimental results show that our approach achieves a significant improvement in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, compared with other existing methods.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)","startPage":"84","endPage":"91","doi":"10.1109/SCC.2017.19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2017.19","pdfPath":"/iel7/8031413/8034950/08034971.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8034950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating Tag, Topic, Co-Occurrence, and Popularity to Recommend Web APIs for Mashup Creation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8034971/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 June 2017","conferenceDate":"25-30 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Tag, Topic, Co-Occurrence, and Popularity to Recommend Web APIs for Mashup Creation","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17190496","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8034971/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Tag, Topic, Co-Occurrence, and Popularity to Recommend Web APIs for Mashup Creation","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"2005a084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075218S","chronDate":"25-30 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8031413","isNumber":"8034950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8031413","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8034950","articleId":"8034971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8034989,"authors":[{"name":"Md Mahfuzer Rahman","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, USA"],"firstName":"Md Mahfuzer","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37086196636"},{"name":"Xiaoqing Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoqing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086127063"},{"name":"Buqing Cao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan, China"],"firstName":"Buqing","lastName":"Cao","id":"38103977200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2005-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2004-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2006-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2474-2473"}],"articleNumber":"8034989","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":522},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Web API Recommendation for Mashup Development Using Matrix Factorization on Integrated Content and Network-Based Service Clustering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8034989","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mashups","Clustering algorithms","Feature extraction","Mathematical model","Computer science","Electronic mail","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","Internet","matrix decomposition","pattern clustering","recommender systems","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recommendation accuracies","web API recommendation","API recommendation method","Mashup services","matrix factorization based recommendation","Mashup development","service clustering","appropriate web APIs","relevant web APIs","suitable APIs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mashup Service","Service Network","Two-Level Topic Model","Mashup Service Clustering","Matrix Factorization","Web API Recommendation"]}],"abstract":"Finding appropriate web APIs to develop mashup services is becoming difficult because of increasing number of web APIs offered from different sources. If we can recommend relevant web APIs for a mashup service based on its requirements, it will help software developers to find suitable APIs easily instead of searching from thousands of web APIs. Although there are many existing methods to recommend web APIs for mashup services, their recommendation accuracies and diversities are still not high. We will present a novel approach in this paper to produce better web API recommendation results in terms of accuracy and diversity. It is a matrix factorization based API recommendation method for Mashup services. It uses a two-level topic model for clustering Mashup services. We used a dataset from programmableWeb to perform experiments and compared results of our method with other existing methods.

In most studies the state-action space that is the key part of RL is predefined. Integration of RL with deep learning method has however taken a tremendous leap forward to solve novel challenging problems such as mastering a board game of Go. The surrounding environment to the agent may not be fully visible, the environment can change over time, and the feedbacks that agent receives for its actions can have a fluctuating delay. In this paper, we propose a Generic Online Learning (GOL) system for such environments. GOL is based on RL with a hierarchical structure to form abstract features in time and adapt to the optimal solutions. The proposed method has been applied to load balancing in 5G cloud random access networks. Simulation results show that GOL successfully achieves the system objectives of reducing both cache-misses and communication load, while incurring only limited system overhead in terms of only a small number of high-level patterns is needed. We believe that the proposed GOL architecture is significant for future online learning of dynamic, partially visible environments, and would be very useful for many autonomous control systems.","doi":"10.1109/HPCS.2017.36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCS.2017.36","startPage":"176","endPage":"185","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030510/8035032/08035075.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8035032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generic Online Learning for Partial Visible Dynamic Environment with Delayed Feedback: Online Learning for 5G C-RAN Load-Balancer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Generic Online Learning for Partial Visible Dynamic Environment with Delayed Feedback: Online Learning for 5G C-RAN Load-Balancer","conferenceDate":"17-21 July 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8035075/","accessionNumber":"17190296","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8035075/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generic Online Learning for Partial Visible Dynamic Environment with Delayed Feedback: Online Learning for 5G C-RAN Load-Balancer","confLoc":"Genoa, Italy","sourcePdf":"3250a176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066971S","chronDate":"17-21 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030510","isNumber":"8035032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030510","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8035032","articleId":"8035075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8035090,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamad.

Recent technological advancements allow placing a group of silicon dies on top of a conventional interposer (silicon layer), which provides space to integrate logic and interconnection resources to manage active processing cores. However, such large resource availability requires an adequate Program eXecution Model (PXM) as well as an efficient mechanism to allocate resources in the system. From this perspective, fine-grain data-driven PXMs represent an attractive solution to reduce the cost of synchronising concurrent activities. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, a hardware architecture called TALHES - a Task ALlocator for HEterogeneous System is proposed to support scheduling of multi-threaded applications (adhering to an explicit data-driven PXM). TALHES introduces a Network-on-Chip (NoC) extension: i) while on-chip 2D-mesh NoCs are used to support locality of computations in the execution of a single task; ii) a global task scheduler integrated into the silicon interposer orchestrates application tasks among different clusters of cores (eventually with different computing capabilities). The second contribution of the paper is a simulation framework that is tailored to support the analysis of such fine-grain data-driven applications. In this work, Linux Containers are used to abstract and efficiently simulate clusters of cores (i.e., a single die), as well as the behaviour of the global scheduling unit.","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","startPage":"503","endPage":"510","doi":"10.1109/HPCS.2017.81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCS.2017.81","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030510/8035032/08035120.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8035032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Data-Driven Task Allocation for Future Many-Cluster On-chip Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8035120/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 July 2017","conferenceDate":"17-21 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Data-Driven Task Allocation for Future Many-Cluster On-chip Systems","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17190358","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8035120/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Data-Driven Task Allocation for Future Many-Cluster On-chip Systems","confLoc":"Genoa, Italy","sourcePdf":"3250a503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083715S","chronDate":"17-21 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030510","isNumber":"8035032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030510","xplore-issue":"8035032","articleId":"8035120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8035121,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Duro","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda de Sistemas y Computadores, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Spain"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Duro","id":"37086151869"},{"name":"Salvador Petit","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda de Sistemas y Computadores, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Spain"],"firstName":"Salvador","lastName":"Petit","id":"37266705200"},{"name":"Julio Sahuquillo","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda de Sistemas y Computadores, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Spain"],"firstName":"Julio","lastName":"Sahuquillo","id":"37274197100"},{"name":"Mar\u00eda E.

Nevertheless, this technology is not mature enough yet in this context, so research efforts focusing on photonic networks are still required to achieve realistic suitable network implementations. In this context, system-level photonic network simulators can help to guide designers to assess the multiple design choices. Most current research is done on electrical network simulators, whose components work widely different from photonics components. Moreover, photonics technology adds new components that are not present in electrical networks. This paper discusses how a photonics simulation tool can be built by extending an electrical simulation framework. We summarize and compare the working behavior of both technologies -electrical and photonics, and discuss the rationale behind the proposed extensions. Among others, the devised extensions model optical routers, wavelength-division multiplexing, circuit switching, and specific routing algorithms. This work is aimed to provide support to investigate off- chip optical networks in the context of the European Exascale System Interconnect and Storage project (ExaNeSt) project. The experiments presented in this paper study multiple realistic photonic networks configurations and have been performed with excerpts of real traces. Experimental results show that, compared to electrical networks, optical networks can reduce the execution time of the workload by several orders of magnitude. Our study reveals that future optical technologies presenting a 3.2 Tbps aggregate link bandwidth will not provide additional performance benefits over state-of-the-art 1.6 Tbps optical links across the studied workloads, but 1.6 Tbps network links are enough to achieve the highest optical performance on computer networks. Regarding the link configuration, the bandwidth per optical channel is the parameter with highest impact on the network delay and so on the execution time, while for a given optical bandwidth per channel the better strategy is to reduce the phit size.","doi":"10.1109/HPCS.2017.82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCS.2017.82","startPage":"511","endPage":"518","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030510/8035032/08035121.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8035032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling a Photonic Network for Exascale Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8035121/","conferenceDate":"17-21 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Modeling a Photonic Network for Exascale Computing","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17190348","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8035121/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling a Photonic Network for Exascale Computing","confLoc":"Genoa, Italy","sourcePdf":"3250a511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104204S","chronDate":"17-21 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030510","isNumber":"8035032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030510","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8035032","articleId":"8035121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8035127,"authors":[{"name":"Max Raphael Sobroza Marques","affiliation":["Dept. of Electron.

We propose a MPI-based modification of the training program which minimizes the overheads of both distributing training jobs and loading and preprocessing training data by using message passing and CPU/GPU computation overlapping. The impact of the proposed optimizations is greater for the more frequent neural network model averaging. To justify our efforts, we examine the influence of averaging frequency on the trained model efficiency. We plot learning curves based on the average log-probability per frame of correct paths for utterances in the validation set, as well as word error rates of test set decodings. Based on experiments with training on 2 workstations with 4 GPUs each we point that for the given network architecture, dataset and computing environment there is a certain range of averaging frequencies that are optimal for the model efficiency.

Mapping applications into 3D FPGAs requires a set of accompanying suite of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools. One of critical issue of a 3D FPGA-based implementation is the quality and efficiency of associated CAD algorithms. In this paper, we are interested to investigate placement algorithms aspect to optimize proposed 3D FPGA performances. In fact, the way we distribute clusters between 3D FPGA layers has an important impact on performances. We present partitioning- based placement algorithm for 3D FPGA. The circuit is first divided into two layers with limited number of inter-layer interconnections, and then placed on individual layers. Placement solution of each layer is then gradually improved using adapted simulated annealing algorithm. We conduct experiments using exploration platform to compare partitioning-based and simulated annealing based placement approaches for proposed 3D FPGA architecture. Exploration results show that using partitioning-based placement algorithm achieves a saving in terms of power consumption, area and performance by an average of 15%, 18% and 10% Unlike DFPGA, MS-FPGA can deal with complex circuits.","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030510/8035032/08035130.pdf","startPage":"572","endPage":"579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Exploiting Partitioning-Based Placement Approach for Performances Improvement of 3D FPGA","doi":"10.1109/HPCS.2017.91","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8035032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCS.2017.91","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8035130","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8035130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"On Exploiting Partitioning-Based Placement Approach for Performances Improvement of 3D FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17190317","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-21 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8035130/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Exploiting Partitioning-Based Placement Approach for Performances Improvement of 3D FPGA","confLoc":"Genoa, Italy","sourcePdf":"3250a572.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075569S","chronDate":"17-21 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030510","isNumber":"8035032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030510","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8035032","articleId":"8035130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8035131,"authors":[{"name":"Yomna Ben Jmaa","affiliation":["LAMIH UMR CNRS 8201, University of Valenciennes and Hainaut-Cambresis, France","ReDCAD, University of Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Yomna Ben","lastName":"Jmaa","id":"37086133718"},{"name":"Karim M.

Both CPUs and Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) can solve these linear equations, but choosing the best architecture that perfectly fits the computation patterns is not an easy task. In this work, Gaussian Elimination, as an accurate method of solving linear equations, is being conducted on different parallel architectures such as multicore architectures, using different codes, and GPUs in order to find the best architecture for this kind of problems. The overall results of the multicore implementations outperformed those using GPUs because of the data transfer time in GPUs.","doi":"10.1109/HPCS.2017.132","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030510/8035032/08035171.pdf","startPage":"870","endPage":"874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCS.2017.132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8035032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Performance of Dense Linear Algebra with Multi-core Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving Performance of Dense Linear Algebra with Multi-core Architecture","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17190301","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8035171/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8035171/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 July 2017","conferenceDate":"17-21 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Performance of Dense Linear Algebra with Multi-core Architecture","confLoc":"Genoa, Italy","sourcePdf":"3250a870.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072092S","chronDate":"17-21 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030510","isNumber":"8035032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030510","xplore-issue":"8035032","articleId":"8035171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8035182,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Baldi","affiliation":["DII, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Baldi","id":"37063962300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3250-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3249-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-3248-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3251-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8035182","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8035182","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Quantum computing","Computers","Digital signatures","Sparse matrices","Public key"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","quantum cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["post-quantum cryptographic schemes","code","quantum algorithms","classical nonquantum computers","nonordered list","polynomial time"]}],"abstract":"Not all mathematical problems that today are considered hard will remain hard after the advent of quantum computers.

In order to exploit the dense sampling of the spectrum of HS sensors to discriminate multiple land-cover changes ad-hoc techniques are required. In this paper we propose a novel method for unsupervised multiple Change Detection (CD) in HS multitemporal images based on binary Spectral Change Vectors (SCVs). In greater detail, the method discriminates between unchanged and changed areas in order to focus only on the latter ones. Then, it converts the real valued SCVs in a binary form to work in a discrete high dimensional space. The binary SCVs are clustered following an hierarchical tree structure where each leaf represent a kind of change. The tree also highlights how the different changes are related among each other. The proposed approach has been tested on a multitemporal dataset acquired over an agricultural area. Experimental results confirmed that the binary SCVs allows us to detect and discriminate multiple changes by working in a simpler discrete space.","doi":"10.1109/Multi-Temp.2017.8035239","pdfPath":"/iel7/8027284/8035194/08035239.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images (MultiTemp)","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images (MultiTemp)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Multi-Temp.2017.8035239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8035194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel method for unsupervised multiple Change Detection in hyperspectral images based on binary Spectral Change Vectors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8035239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"A novel method for unsupervised multiple Change Detection in hyperspectral images based on binary Spectral Change Vectors","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17175262","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8035239/","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel method for unsupervised multiple Change Detection in hyperspectral images based on binary Spectral Change Vectors","confLoc":"Brugge, Belgium","sourcePdf":"074_MARINELLI.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035475S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8027284","isNumber":"8035194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8027284","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8035194","articleId":"8035239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":8035276,"authors":[{"name":"Long Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical Engineering, Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085820910"},{"name":"Yuqiong Cao","affiliation":["China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuqiong","lastName":"Cao","id":"37086022133"},{"name":"Haitao Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haitao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086022626"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5957-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5956-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5958-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8035276","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Entropy","Uplink","Cognitive radio","Probability distribution","Stability analysis","Fluid flow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","differential games","optimal control","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal congestion control","elastic traffic","cognitive radio ad hoc networks","predictable contact","differential game based framework","flow rate","upstream secondary users","SU","noncooperation","rate based congestion control","spectrum opportunities","optimal rate regulation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","ad hoc networks","congestion control","predictable contact","elastic traffic"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On achieving optimal congestion control for elastic traffic in cognitive radio ad hoc networks under predictable contact","doi":"10.1109/CITS.2017.8035276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8035266","endPage":"14","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems (CITS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems (CITS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8027230/8035266/08035276.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CITS.2017.8035276","startPage":"10","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8035276","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the congestion control problem for elastic traffic over cognitive radio ad hoc networks under predictable contact.

Software-defined base station implementations have recently been able to drastically reduce the cost of hardware. However, covering the operating costs remains an issue, particularly in small communities. In this paper, we present a front end system exploiting significant idle times in a rural GSM network in order to reduce the overall power consumption of the base station, thereby reducing operating costs. The front end utilizes precisely timed switching signals from the downlink transmission of a base station. The switching signals are then used for automatic, on-demand power amplifier duty cycling at the GSM timeslot level to provide virtual coverage to subscribers. An implementation using a software-defined GSM-900 base station demonstrated potential power savings of at least 80% during idle periods. The reduced power consumption is foreseen to further lower capital and operating costs, allowing more rural communities to gain access to cellular communications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8035266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CITS.2017.8035310","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems (CITS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems (CITS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8027230/8035266/08035310.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"204","doi":"10.1109/CITS.2017.8035310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GSM timeslot detection and switching for power amplifier duty cycling in community cellular networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"GSM timeslot detection and switching for power amplifier duty cycling in community cellular networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8035310/","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17175235","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8035310/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GSM timeslot detection and switching for power amplifier duty cycling in community cellular networks","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"1570360627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045636S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8027230","isNumber":"8035266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8027230","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8035266","articleId":"8035310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8035311,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaonan Su","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xiaonan","lastName":"Su","id":"37086082246"},{"name":"Changle Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Changle","lastName":"Li","id":"37085518833"},{"name":"Yueyang Song","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Yueyang","lastName":"Song","id":"37085644578"},{"name":"Xiaoming Yuan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085646998"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5957-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5956-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5958-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8035311","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"abstract":"Various current trends such as ever growing population have effectively promoted the growth of Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN).

We constructed the prototype system from modules to system architecture, and conducted a set of experiments to verify the prototype system as well as optimize parameters in IEEE 802.15.6.

Cloud computing supports virtual machines (VMs) to host multiple applications simultaneously. Balancing the large numbers of applications in the heterogeneous cloud environment becomes challenging as the hypervisor scheduling controls all VMs. When the scheduler allocates tasks to the overloaded VMs, the performance of the cloud system degrades. In this paper, we present a novel load balancing approach to organizing the virtualized resources of the data center efficiently. In our approach, the load to a VM scales up and down according to the resource capacity of the VM. The proposed scheme minimizes the makespan of the system, maximizes resource utilization and reduces the overall energy consumption.

In this paper, we first present a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication model and then propose a novel MAC protocol in VLC named OCTMAC which combines Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) with optical Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) mechanism. Then we analyze the system performance in terms of access delay and network throughput. Finally, the proposed protocol is evaluated with network simulation (NS3) to verify the theoretical analysis on a horizontal and straight road. Simulation results show that the average access delay is 2.75ms when network experiences the worst situation. Also, network throughput is improved by encoding the information with Optical Orthogonal Codes (OOCs).","doi":"10.1109/CITS.2017.8035333","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems (CITS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems (CITS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8027230/8035266/08035333.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CITS.2017.8035333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8035266","startPage":"234","endPage":"238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OCTMAC: A VLC based MAC protocol combining optical CDMA with TDMA for VANETs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8035333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OCTMAC: A VLC based MAC protocol combining optical CDMA with TDMA for VANETs","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8035333/","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17175224","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8035333/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OCTMAC: A VLC based MAC protocol combining optical CDMA with TDMA for VANETs","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"1570364438.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048233S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8027230","isNumber":"8035266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8027230","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8035266","articleId":"8035333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8035336,"authors":[{"name":"Teranai Vichyaloetsiri","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Teranai","lastName":"Vichyaloetsiri","id":"37086130409"},{"name":"Pongpisit Wuttidittachotti","affiliation":["Department of Data Communication and Networking, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pongpisit","lastName":"Wuttidittachotti","id":"37085384865"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5957-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5956-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5958-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8035336","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":319},"abstract":"This research presents a new framework using web services to translate text into a sign language animated GIF.

Based on the sentiments and opinions available, developing a recommendation system is an interesting concept, which includes strategies that combine the small text content with prior knowledge. In this paper, we explore a new application of Recursive Neural Networks (RNN) with deep learning system for sentiment analysis of reviews. The proposed RNN-based Deep-learning Sentiment Analysis (RDSA) recommends the places that are near to the user's current location by analyzing the different reviews and consequently computing the score grounded on it. Deep Learning is used to optimize the recommendations depending on the sentiment analysis performed on the different reviews, which are taken from different social networking sites. The Experiments performed indicate that the RNN based Deep-learning Sentiment Analysis (RDSA) improvises the behavior by increasing the accuracy of the sentiment analysis, which in turn yields better recommendations to the user and thus helps to identify a particular position as per the requirement of the user need.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8035341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8035341/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17190206","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application of Deep Learning to Sentiment Analysis for recommender system on cloud","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Deep Learning to Sentiment Analysis for recommender system on cloud","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"1570364645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095399S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8027230","isNumber":"8035266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8027230","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8035266","articleId":"8035341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8035410,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The nanofluids (NF-0 to NF-3) showed improvement in the AC breakdown voltage, tan delta, flash and fire properties. The AC breakdown voltage increased as the CCTO volume percent increase in the mineral oil. The nanofluids were also subjected to accelerated ageing and the critical parameters, evaluated on the aged nanofluids (ANF-0 to ANF-3), were compared with that of fresh nanofluids. The nanofluids do not show any significant change in the viscosity, however, influences on the electrical properties were observed. The improvement in electrical properties can be attributed to the formation of insulating boundaries in nanomaterial which acts as insulation barrier that hinders the breakdown mechanism.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2017.006096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8032560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2017.006096","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/94/8032560/08035410.pdf","startPage":"2344","endPage":"2353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mineral oil based high permittivity CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) nanofluids for power transformer application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Mineral oil based high permittivity CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) nanofluids for power transformer application","volume":"24","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8035410/","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17171430","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8035410/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mineral oil based high permittivity CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) nanofluids for power transformer application","sourcePdf":"p2344prasath.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11386S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"8032560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8032560","articleId":"8035410","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8035415,"authors":[{"name":"Vani Wang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/8032560/8035415/8035415-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yani Wang was born in Shannxi, China, in 1991.

In order to investigate the nanostructures and space charge characteristics of magnesium oxide (MgO)/low-density polyethylene (LDPE), samples of LDPE with nano-MgO from 0.1 to 2.0 wt% are prepared, as well as pure LDPE. The nanostructures of nanocomposites are investigated by the technology of synchrotron radiation small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), and the space charge distributions in nanocomposites and LDPE are measured by the pulsed electro-acoustic (PEA) method. Results of the synchrotron radiation SAXS experiments reveal that there is obvious interphase between the nano-MgO particle and the LDPE matrix, the thickness of which increases along with the increase in nano-MgO concentration. The agglomeration and mass fractal exist in all nanocomposites, and become more obvious at higher concentration. Results of space charge measurements indicate that the apparent trap-controlled mobilities and the apparent trap depths are respectively larger and smaller than those in LDPE during the initial phase of depolarization when the concentrations are 0.1 and 0.5 wt%, and are respectively smaller and larger than those in LDPE when the concentrations are 1.0 and 2.0 wt%. The space charge amount decreases after the addition of nano-MgO. This is mainly due to the introduction of shallow traps which promote the charge recombination in 0.1 and 0.5 wt% MgO/LDPE nanocomposites, and the introduction of deep traps which restrict the charge transportation in 1.0 and 2.0 wt% MgO/LDPE nanocomposites. The space charge characteristics of MgO/LDPE nanocomposites are explained combined with the nanostructures obtained from the synchrotron radiation SAXS experiments.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8032560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/94/8032560/08035415.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2017.006378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2017.006378","startPage":"2390","endPage":"2399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nanostructures and space charge characteristics of MgO/LDPE nanocomposites","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8035415/","displayDocTitle":"Nanostructures and space charge characteristics of MgO/LDPE nanocomposites","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8035415/","volume":"24","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"17171400","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2017","publicationDate":"2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nanostructures and space charge characteristics of MgO/LDPE nanocomposites","sourcePdf":"p2390wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077729S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"8032560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8032560","articleId":"8035415","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8036175,"authors":[{"name":"Mai O.

The antenna is characterized by its high directivity (10.8 dBi) and a wide axial ratio bandwidth, which covers the range from 188.2 to 197.8 THz.

Duobinary message is generated by using the combination of duobinary precoder, duobinary generator & RZ/NRZ pulse generator. Laser rate equations are used to model chaos generation through semiconductor laser whereas message is made secured by hiding it through chaos masking scheme. Propagation of chaos hiding the multi-format message is studied for long distance communication model. Synchronization between transmitter & receiver is achieved to obtain the acceptable eye-diagrams & quality factor (Q-factor). Q-factor is function of optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) that gives a qualitative performance of receiver. It provides the minimum SNR to obtain specific bit error rate of signal. A comparison is made with & without deployment of chaos masking scheme on RZ & NRZ duobinary optical system to observe the penalty in terms of Q-factor. In addition, response of amplifier on chaotic signal due to its nonlinearities is investigated by varying the gain of amplifier.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2752002","publicationTitle":"IEEE

Consequently, many researchers have used external information to improve recommendation technology. However, most previous studies consider only adding single relationship types, such as social networking friend-relationships. In the real world, considering multiple types of external relations can more accurately determine the reason why a user selected an item. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a hybrid method called the semantic preference-based personalized recommendation on heterogeneous information networks (SPR), which combines user feedback scores with heterogeneous information networks. This method can improve recommendation problems by considering multiple types of external relationships. To apply the method, we first introduce a similarity measure between users based on a user's potential preferences in the meta-path and design the recommended model at the global and individual level. Finally, we perform experiments on two real-world data sets, finding that the SPR method achieves better results compared with the several widely employed and the state-of-the-art recommendation methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2751682","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08036183.pdf","startPage":"19773","endPage":"19781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2751682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic Preference-Based Personalized Recommendation on Heterogeneous Information Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036183/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Semantic Preference-Based Personalized Recommendation on Heterogeneous Information Network","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17266493","htmlLink":"/document/8036183/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701190"},{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Plan of China","grantNumber":"2017YFA0604500"},{"fundingName":"National Sci-Tech Support Plan of China","grantNumber":"2014BAH02F00"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007847","fundingName":"Youth Science Foundation of Jilin Province of China","grantNumber":"20160520011JH"},{"fundingName":"Youth Sci-Tech Innovation Leader and Team Project of Jilin Province of China","grantNumber":"20170519017JH"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Semantic Preference-Based Personalized Recommendation on Heterogeneous Information Network","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2751682-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098101S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8036183","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8036186,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Krause Perin","affiliation":["Edward L.

We propose and evaluate low-power DSP-free homodyne coherent receiver architectures for dual-polarization quadrature phase shift keying (DP-QPSK) for inter- and intradata center links. We propose a novel optical polarization demultiplexing technique, for DP-QPSK and higher-order modulation formats, with three cascaded phase shifters driven by marker tone detection circuitry. We consider carrier recovery based on either optical or electrical phase-locked loops (PLLs). We propose a novel multiplier-free phase detector based on XOR gates, which exhibits less than 0.5 dB power penalty relative to a conventional Costas loop phase detector. We also study the relative performance of homodyne DP-differential QPSK, for which carrier phase recovery is unnecessary. Our proposed DSP-free architectures exhibit ~1 dB power penalty at small chromatic dispersion compared to their DSP-based counterparts. We estimate conservatively that the high-speed analog electronics of an electrical PLL-based coherent receiver consume nearly 4 W for 200 Gbit/s DP-QPSK, assuming a 90-nm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor process.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8067628/08036186.pdf","startPage":"4650","endPage":"4662","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2752079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2752079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8067628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Low-Power DSP-Free Coherent Receivers for Data Center Links","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Optical polarization","Demultiplexing","Phase shift keying","Phase shifters","Optical fiber polarization","High-speed optical techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","demultiplexing","digital signal processing chips","homodyne detection","integrated optics","multiplexing","optical computing","optical modulation","optical receivers","phase detectors","phase locked loops","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coherent detection","high spectral efficiency","receiver sensitivity","digital signal processing","short-reach applications","fiber propagation impairments","low-power DSP-free homodyne coherent receiver architectures","dual-polarization quadrature phase shift","DP-QPSK","intradata center links","optical polarization demultiplexing technique","higher-order modulation formats","cascaded phase shifters","marker tone detection circuitry","optical phase","electrical phase","homodyne DP-differential QPSK","carrier phase recovery","DSP-free architectures","CMOS","complementary metal-oxide semiconductor process","XOR gates","Costas loop phase detector","PLL","phase-locked loops","multiplier-free phase detector","power penalty","bit rate 200.0 Gbit/s","size 90 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier phase recovery","coherent detection","data centers","DQPSK","DSP-free","electrical phase-locked loop","low power","optical phase-locked loop","polarization controller","polarization demultiplexing","QPSK"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/50/8067628/8036186-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1, 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design of Low-Power DSP-Free Coherent Receivers for Data Center Links","volume":"35","issue":"21","htmlLink":"/document/8036186/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Nov.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"17243684","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Maxim Integrated"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006785","fundingName":"Google"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1740291"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002322","fundingName":"CAPES Fellowship Proc.","grantNumber":"13318/13-6"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Design of Low-Power DSP-Free Coherent Receivers for Data Center Links","sourcePdf":"jlt-krauseperin-2752079-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144118S","chronDate":"Nov.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8067628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8067628","articleId":"8036186","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8036189,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Yang","affiliation":["Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8036189/yang-2751619-small.gif","p":["Yong Yang received the B.Sc. degree in automation from Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, China, in 2003, the M.Sc. degree in power electronics from Guizhou University, Guiyang, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in power electronics from Shanghai University, Shanghai, China, in 2010.

However, due to variable switching frequency, the harmonics of inverter output current spread in a wide range of frequency. Furthermore, a large amount of computation is required for the implementation of the traditional FCS-MPC method. Here, an improved FCS-MPC algorithm with fast computation and fixed switching frequency is proposed in this paper for two-level three-phase inverters. First, according to the principle of deadbeat control, the inverter voltage vector reference can be constructed. Then, the operation durations and sequences of different voltage vectors are determined according to the location of the inverter voltage vector reference and the cost functions of different voltage vectors. In this algorithm, the operation durations of different voltage vectors are arranged inversely proportional to their cost functions. Compared with the conventional fixed switching frequency FCS-MPC control, the number of sectors involved in the FCS-MPC calculation can be reduced from 6 to 1, which greatly improves the computation efficiency. Moreover, the delay due to digital implementation is effectively compensated in the proposed algorithm. Finally, experimental tests are carried out to verify the advantages of the proposed method in terms of both steady-state and dynamic performance.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08036189.pdf","startPage":"17904","endPage":"17913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2751619","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2751619","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036189","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Switches","Switching frequency","Power harmonic filters","Prediction algorithms","Harmonic analysis","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","invertors","machine control","power convertors","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FCS-MPC calculation","delay compensation","finite control set-model","variable switching frequency","two-level three-phase inverters","deadbeat control","inverter voltage vector reference","cost functions","voltage vectors","fixed switching frequency control","switching frequency model predictive control","FCS-MPC algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite control set-model predictive control (FCS-MPC)","harmonics","fixed switching frequency","cost function","deadbeat control","delay compensation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036189/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Fast and Fixed Switching Frequency Model Predictive Control With Delay Compensation for Three-Phase Inverters","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17246475","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2017","publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/8036189/","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Young Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51407124"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2015M581857"},{"fundingName":"Suzhou Prospective Applied Research Project","grantNumber":"SYG201640"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Fast and Fixed Switching Frequency Model Predictive Control With Delay Compensation for Three-Phase Inverters","sourcePdf":"access-wen-2751619-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087944S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8036189","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8036190,"authors":[{"name":"Kelvin Anoh","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8036190/anoh-2751620-small.gif","p":["Kelvin Anoh (S\u201911\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree (Hons.) in industrial physics from Ebonyi State University, Nigeria, in 2006, the M.Sc. degree in data telecommunications and networks from the University of Salford, U.K., in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications engineering from the University of Bradford, U.K., in 2015.

We introduce a uniform distribution approach to solving the PAPR reduction problem of OFDM signals and then use Lagrange multiplier (LM) optimization to minimize the number of iterations involved in an adaptive fashion. Due to the nonlinear attenuation of the PAPR reduction scheme, we compensate the output signal using a correlation factor that minimizes the error floor in the in-band distortion of the clipped signal using the minimum mean square error method so as to improve the BER performance. Three different methods are introduced each enabling PAPR reduction by clipping followed by filtering with no direct dependence on a clipping ratio parameter. We find that our approach significantly reduces the PAPR of the OFDM signals (especially with LM optimization) better than the conventional adaptive iterative clipping and filtering operating without LM optimization. Based on our proposed methods, we additionally outline two simple steps for achieving perfect PAPR reduction (i.e., 0 dB). We also evaluate the performance of the three new models over high power amplifier (HPA) for completeness; the HPA is found to induce negligible BER degradation effects on the processed signal compared with the unprocessed signal.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08036190.pdf","startPage":"17533","endPage":"17544","publicationTitle":"IEEE

wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this letter, we propose a novel load balancing strategy for data transmission of WSNs, namely, super links-based data drainage, which makes full use of the advantages of super nodes with more powerful hardware and greater communication capacity to realize data traffic redistribution. Being different from conventional passive late-remedy approaches, this is a positive and early-intervention strategy. Specifically, an evaluation function is designed to select appropriate start points and end points of super links, and the core idea is to transfer data from locations relatively far from the sink with a jump of data traffic to those near the sink with little data traffic. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the new strategy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036191/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","volume":"22","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17485374","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8036191/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Data Drainage: A Novel Load Balancing Strategy for Wireless Sensor Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61001112, 61372082 and 61671209"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Foundation, China","grantNumber":"S2013010012141"},{"fundingName":"Cultivation Program for Major Projects and Important Achievements of Guangdong Province, China","grantNumber":"2014KTSCX012 and 2016KTSCX005"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China","grantNumber":"2011ZM0030, 2013ZZ0042 and 2015ZZ090"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Drainage: A Novel Load Balancing Strategy for Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-liu-2751601-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071199S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8249516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8249516","articleId":"8036191","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8036193,"authors":[{"name":"Guirong Feng","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Antenna and Microwave Technology, School of Electronic Engineering, University of Xidian, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Guirong","lastName":"Feng","id":"37086243850"},{"name":"Lei Chen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Antenna and Microwave Technology, School of Electronic Engineering, University of Xidian, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406310100"},{"name":"Xingsi Xue","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Fujian University of Technology, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xingsi","lastName":"Xue","id":"37085629253"},{"name":"Xiaowei Shi","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Antenna and Microwave Technology, School of Electronic Engineering, University of Xidian, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Shi","id":"37275304300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"8036193","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2493},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036193","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband antennas","Surface waves","Bandwidth","Antenna radiation patterns","Antenna measurements","Surface impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","broadband antennas","metamaterial antennas","microstrip antennas","microwave metamaterials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband surface-wave antenna","monopole-like radiation pattern","wide bandwidth","constructively increasing surface-wave fields","nonuniform tapered metasurface","inner rectangular patches","resonant modes","ground-plane size reduction","surface-wave fields","frequency 4.56 GHz to 6.37 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial magnetic conductor","broadband antenna","metasurface (MS)","surface-wave antenna (SWA)"]}],"abstract":"A broadband surface-wave antenna with a monopole-like radiation pattern is presented.

In security imaging, we use these features to discover weapons concealed under clothes. Self-organizing map (SOM), a type of neural networks, can map highdimensional data on any dimension with unsupervised learning. It is utilized for clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data. Previously, we proposed a millimeter-wave imaging system for moving targets consisting of a 1-D array antenna, a parallel front end, and a complex-valued SOM to deal with complex texture. Experiments demonstrated its high performance in the visualization. In this paper, we investigate the dependence of the visualization performance on its configuration parameters as well as processing parameters. We reveal the effect of the modulation-frequency number and the window size. We also discuss the effective depth range for visualization and a tradeoff relationship between the measurement time and the visualization quality.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2751618","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08036195.pdf","startPage":"22927","endPage":"22939","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2751618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Dependence on System Parameters in Millimeter-Wave Active Imaging Based on Complex-Valued Neural Networks to Classify Complex Texture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036195/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance Dependence on System Parameters in Millimeter-Wave Active Imaging Based on Complex-Valued Neural Networks to Classify Complex Texture","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17381101","publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/8036195/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"21300089"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Performance Dependence on System Parameters in Millimeter-Wave Active Imaging Based on Complex-Valued Neural Networks to Classify Complex Texture","sourcePdf":"access-arima-2751618-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057566S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8036195","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8036199,"authors":[{"name":"Hyung-Sin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/8115327/8036199/kim-2751617-small.gif","p":["Hyung-Sin Kim received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from Seoul National University (SNU), Seoul, South Korea, in 2009, 2011, and 2016, respectively.

Specifically, RPL is designed to be a simple and inter-operable networking protocol for resource-constrained devices in industrial, home, and urban environments, intended to support the vision of the Internet of Things with thousands of devices interconnected through multihop mesh networks. More than four-years have passed since the standardization of RPL, and we believe that it is time to examine and understand its current state. In this paper, we review the history of research efforts in RPL; what aspects have been (and have not been) investigated and evaluated, how they have been studied, what was (and was not) implemented, and what remains for future investigation. We reviewed over 97 RPL-related academic research papers published by major academic publishers and present a topic-oriented survey for these research efforts. Our survey shows that only 40.2% of the papers evaluate RPL through experiments using implementations on real embedded devices, ContikiOS and TinyOS are the two most popular implementations (92.3%), and TelosB was the most frequently used hardware platform (69%) on testbeds that have average and median size of 49.4 and 30.5 nodes, respectively. Furthermore, unfortunately, despite it being approximately four years since its initial standardization, we are yet to see wide adoption of RPL as part of real-world systems and applications. We present our observations on the reasons behind this and suggest directions on which RPL should evolve.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2017.2751617","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8115327/08036199.pdf","startPage":"2502","endPage":"2525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2017.2751617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8115327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Challenging the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL): A Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036199","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/9739/8115327/8036199-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourthquarter  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036199/","displayDocTitle":"Challenging the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL): A Survey","volume":"19","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Fourthquarter 2017","accessionNumber":"17466457","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8036199/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010002","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1D1A1B03031348 and NRF-2016R1A6A3A03007799"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006335","fundingName":"Industrial Infrastructure Program for Fundamental Technologies"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy of Korea","grantNumber":"N0002312"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CPS-1239552"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Challenging the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL): A Survey","sourcePdf":"comst-paek-2751617-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.216064S","chronDate":"Fourthquarter  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8115327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"8115327","articleId":"8036199","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8036205,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohua Ge","affiliation":["School of Software and Electrical Engineering, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8248572/8036205/ge-2752148-small.gif","p":["Xiaohua Ge received the B.Eng. degree in electronic and information\n engineering from Nanchang Hangkong University, Nanchang, China, in 2008, the M.Eng. degree in control theory and\n control engineering from Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in computer\n engineering from Central Queensland University, Rockhampton, QLD, Australia, in 2014.","From 2011 to 2013, he was a Research Assistant with the Centre for Intelligent and Networked Systems, Central\n Queensland University, where he was a Research Fellow with 2014.

First, to fulfill multiple formation tasks, a group of agents are decomposed into M distinct and nonoverlapping clusters. The agents in each cluster are then driven to achieve a desired formation, whereas the MAS as a whole accomplishes M cluster formations. Second, by a proper modeling of aperiodic sampling and communication delays, an aperiodic sampled-data cluster formation protocol (CFP) is delicately constructed such that the information exchanges among neighboring agents only occur intermittently at discrete instants of time. Third, a detailed theoretical analysis of cluster formability is carried out and a sufficient and necessary condition is provided such that the system is M-cluster formable. Furthermore, a discontinuous Lyapunov functional approach is developed to derive a design criterion on the existence of an admissible sampled-data CFP. Finally, numerical simulations on a team of nonholonomic mobile robots are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical result.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2752148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2752148","startPage":"3417","endPage":"3426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8248572/08036205.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8248572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving Cluster Formation of Multi-Agent Systems Under Aperiodic Sampling and Communication Delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Achieving Cluster Formation of Multi-Agent Systems Under Aperiodic Sampling and Communication Delays","volume":"65","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17485632","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8036205/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery Project","grantNumber":"DP160103567"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving Cluster Formation of Multi-Agent Systems Under Aperiodic Sampling and Communication Delays","sourcePdf":"tie-han-2752148-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110774S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8248572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"8248572","articleId":"8036205","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8036208,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Giterman","affiliation":["Emerging Nanoscaled Integrated Circuits and Systems Laboratories, Faculty of Engineering, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8314245/8036208/giter-2747087-small.gif","p":["Robert Giterman received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Ben-Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel, in 2013, and the M.Sc. degree at Ben-Gurion University in 2014 as part of a fast track program for outstanding students.

While GC-eDRAM provides high-density, low-leakage, low-voltage, and inherent2-ported operation, its limited retention time requires periodic, power-hungry refresh cycles. This drawback is further aggravated at scaled technologies, where increased subthreshold leakage currents and decreased in-cell storage capacitances result in faster data integrity deterioration. Therefore, integration of GC-eDRAM within modern systems is often considered to be limited to mature process technologies, where these phenomena are less detrimental. In this paper, we present for the first time a fully functional GC-eDRAM array, implemented and fabricated in a 28-nm process node. The 8-kb array is based on a novel, 2-ported, 4-transistor NMOS-only bitcell with internal feedback to provide efficient operation in the target 28-nm FD-SOI technology. The fabricated memory macro achieves more than 1.6-ms data retention time at 27 \u00b0C, which is 30\u00d7 longer than conventional gain-cell topologies when applied to this technology. The described 4-transistor dual-port nMOS array utilizes over 70% of the total memory macro area, while retaining almost 30% lower cell area than a single-ported 6T SRAM in the same technology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036208/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","volume":"65","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"17617601","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8036208/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 4-Transistor nMOS-Only Logic-Compatible Gain-Cell Embedded DRAM With Over 1.6-ms Retention Time at 700 mV in 28-nm FD-SOI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 4-Transistor nMOS-Only Logic-Compatible Gain-Cell Embedded DRAM With Over 1.6-ms Retention Time at 700 mV in 28-nm FD-SOI","sourcePdf":"tcsi-giterman-2747087-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089952S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8314245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8314245","articleId":"8036208","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8036212,"authors":[{"name":"Hsi-Tseng Chou","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8087858/8036212/chou-2751657-small.gif","p":["Dr. Hsi-Tseng Chou (M\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1988, and the M.S. and Ph.

In contrast to the conventional BFN architecture, which feeds each antenna element by using individual set of RF devices, the restructured RF modules may simplify the BFN architecture. They may dramatically reduce the cost without significantly sacrificing the radiation performance. In this technique, the RF devices to feed antenna elements are subdivided into groups for modularization. Each module is formed by very few elements of RF devices to form a multilevel BFN, where the number of RF elements in each module are the integer factors of array size. Each module at the same layer consists of identical RF structures to minimize the mass manufacture cost. In this paper, the theoretical foundation is developed to provide design guidelines. Examination of radiation discrepancy is also investigated to demonstrate the feasibility and validate the proposed technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036212/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","volume":"65","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"17288702","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8036212/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel Subarray Modularization to Construct Hierarchical Beamforming Networks for Phased Array of Antennas With Low Complexity","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007225","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004874","fundingName":"National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, Taiwan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel Subarray Modularization to Construct Hierarchical Beamforming Networks for Phased Array of Antennas With Low Complexity","sourcePdf":"tap-chou-2751657-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096407S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8087858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8087858","articleId":"8036212","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8036215,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunseok Oh","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8248572/8036215/oh-2752151-small.gif","p":["Hyunseok Oh received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from\n Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2004, the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute\n of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the\n University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA, in 2012.","He is an Assistant Professor with the School of the Mechanical Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and\n Technology, Gwangju, South Korea.

For scalability, a vibration imaging approach is devised that incorporates data from systems with various scales, such as small testbeds and real field-deployed systems. Moreover, a deep learning approach is proposed for unsupervised feature engineering. The overall procedure includes three key steps: 1) vibration image generation; 2) unsupervised feature extraction; and 3) fault classifier design. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach, three case studies are conducted using an RK4 rotor kit and a power plant journal bearing system. By incorporating smaller-system data as well as real-system data, the proposed approach can substantially increase the applicability of the fault diagnosis method while maintaining good accuracy. Moreover, the time and effort needed to develop a diagnostic approach for other rotor systems can be reduced considerably.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8248572/08036215.pdf","startPage":"3539","endPage":"3549","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2752151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2752151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8248572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable and Unsupervised Feature Engineering Using Vibration-Imaging and Deep Learning for Rotor System Diagnosis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Rotors","Feature extraction","Vibrations","Training","Fault diagnosis","Imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","feature extraction","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","machine bearings","power plants","rotors","vibrational signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rotor system diagnosis","vibration image generation","unsupervised feature extraction","fault classifier design","deep learning approach","field-deployed systems","vibration imaging approach","scalable feature engineering","unsupervised feature engineering","fault diagnosis method","real-system data","smaller-system data","power plant journal bearing system","RK4 rotor kit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning","diagnostics","feature engineering","field data","vibration image"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Scalable and Unsupervised Feature Engineering Using Vibration-Imaging and Deep Learning for Rotor System Diagnosis","volume":"65","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8036215/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17485639","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Korea Electric Power Corporation","grantNumber":"R17TH02"},{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002701","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1C1B5017993"},{"fundingName":"Institute of Advanced Machinery and Design at Seoul National University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable and Unsupervised Feature Engineering Using Vibration-Imaging and Deep Learning for Rotor System Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"tie-youn-2752151-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.180807S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8248572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8248572","articleId":"8036215","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8036228,"authors":[{"name":"Luz Maria Neira","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8087858/8036228/neira-2751668-small.gif","p":["Luz Maria Neira (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree (Hons.) in industrial engineering and the Diploma degree in electrical engineering from the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile, in 2009, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, Madison, WI, USA, in 2015, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","Her current research interests include microwave imaging for diagnostic and therapeutic biomedical applications.","Ms. Neira received the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison Chancellor\u2019s Opportunity Fellowship in 2013 and a first prize award in the USNC-URSI Student Paper Competition at the 2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation and North American Radio Science Meeting, Vancouver, BC, Canada."]},"firstName":"Luz Maria","lastName":"Neira","orcid":"0000-0003-2188-715X","id":"37085415571"},{"name":"Barry D.

However, conventional regularization techniques used to solve the ill-posed inverse problem typically result in blurred boundaries between tissue structures exhibiting dielectric contrast, thereby limiting the effective resolution. We present a method to improve microwave breast imaging resolution that incorporates a priori information about the boundaries between different tissues in the breast into the inverse scattering algorithm. This spatial prior information can be derived from another imaging modality, such as magnetic resonance imaging. Our method exploits the fact that the dielectric properties within a tissue type exhibit low to moderate variability by favoring solutions to the inverse scattering problem, which have small variations in dielectric properties within each tissue region. The amount of variation tolerated in each regions is controlled by a spatial prior constraint parameter. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method by imaging detailed, anatomically inspired numerical 3-D breast phantoms. The performance in the presence of different levels of noise and for different choices of the constraint parameter is evaluated. We also demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm with respect to errors in the spatial prior information.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/8/8087858/8036228-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","volume":"65","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8036228/","accessionNumber":"17288722","displayDocTitle":"High-Resolution Microwave Breast Imaging Using a 3-D Inverse Scattering Algorithm With a Variable-Strength Spatial Prior Constraint","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS 1128049"},{"fundingName":"UW-Madison Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education"},{"fundingName":"Philip D.

This method is based on utilizing multimode resonators inside a 3-D unit cell to obtain an absorption-reflection-absorption response. Detailed analysis of this 3-D absorptive frequency selective reflector (AFSR) is provided with the aid of an equivalent circuit model to reveal the operating principle. To show the benefit of the new structure in antenna's radar cross section reduction (RCSR), a dual-polarized 3-D-AFSR integrated with monopole and dipole antennas are simulated, fabricated, and then measured. Compared with their counterparts with normal ground plane, AFSR-backed antennas have shown a remarkable out-of-band RCSR.

The day-ahead products of energy storage system include energy as well as reserve commitment (as one of the ancillary services), whereas its balancing product is the energy deployed from the committed reserve. The proposed model captures the interactions of different markets and their impacts on the functioning of the storage system. It also provides an insight for storage system into clearing process of multiple markets and enables such a facility to possibly affect the outcomes of those markets to its own benefit through strategic price and quantity offers.

To maximize the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the beamformer design comprises two intertwined stages, the determination of beamforming weights and the reconfiguration of array structure. The SNR maximization may produce high sidelobe levels, making the receiver vulnerable to interferences. We consider the problem of achieving maximum SNR beamforming subject to specified quiescent pattern constraints and, as such, combine both adaptive and deterministic approaches for sparse array configurations. We employ two convex relaxation methods and an iterative linear fractional programming algorithm to solve the nonconvex antenna selection problem for sparse array beamformers. Simulation examples demonstrate that the array configuration plays a vital role in determining the beamforming performance in interference-free scenarios.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/8/8087858/8036237-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17288691","htmlLink":"/document/8036237/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Array Quiescent Beamformer Design Combining Adaptive and Deterministic Constraints","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research Development Program","grantNumber":"2016YFB1200100"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"AST-1547420"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Sparse Array Quiescent Beamformer Design Combining Adaptive and Deterministic Constraints","sourcePdf":"tap-wang-2751672-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145819S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8087858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8087858","articleId":"8036237","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8036239,"authors":[{"name":"Carlo Condo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8314245/8036239/condo-2745902-small.gif","p":["Carlo Condo received the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Politecnico di Torino and the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics and telecommunications engineering from the Politecnico di Torino and Telecom Bretagne in 2014.

Currently, information-centric networks (ICN) are the main trend of next-generation networks, which promote traditional social networks to information-centric social networks (IC-SN). Because of the complexity and openness of social networks, the filtering of security services for users is a key issue. However, existing schemes were proposed for traditional social networks and cannot satisfy the new requirements of IC-SN including extendibility, data mobility, use of non-IP addresses, and flexible deployment. To address this challenge, a fog-computing-based content-aware filtering method for security services, FCSS, is proposed in information centric social networks. In FCSS, the assessment and content- matching schemes and the fog-computing-based content-aware filtering scheme is proposed for security services in IC-SN. FCSS contributes to IC-SN as follows. First, fog computing is introduced into IC-SN to shifting intelligence and resources from remote servers to network edge, which provides low-latency for security service filtering and end to end communications. Second, content-label technology based efficient content-aware filtering scheme is adapted for edge of IN-SN to realize accurate filtering for security services. The simulations and evaluations show the advantages of FCSS in terms of hit ratio, filtering delay, and filtering accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2017.2747158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2017.2747158","startPage":"553","endPage":"564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/8922818/08036242.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8922818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FCSS: Fog-Computing-based Content-Aware Filtering for Security Services in Information-Centric Social Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"FCSS: Fog-Computing-based Content-Aware Filtering for Security Services in Information-Centric Social Networks","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2019","accessionNumber":"19194209","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8036242/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401273, 61571300 and 61431008"},{"fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"JP16K00117 and JP15K15976"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011923","fundingName":"KDDI Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FCSS: Fog-Computing-based Content-Aware Filtering for Security Services in Information-Centric Social Networks","sourcePdf":"tetc-dong-2747158-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153603S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"8922818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"8922818","articleId":"8036242","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8036245,"authors":[{"name":"Chenguang Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Autonomous Systems and Networked Control, College of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/8246664/8036245/yang-2743000-small.gif","p":["Chenguang Yang received the B.Eng. degree in measurement and control from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in control engineering from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2010.","He received post-doctoral training at Imperial College London, London, U.K. He is with the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, and Swansea University, Swansea, U.K. His current research interests include robotics, automation, and computational intelligence.

By processing the electromyography (EMG) signals collected from human muscles, the limb impedance could be extracted and transferred to robots. The existing impedance transfer interfaces rely only on visual feedback and, thus, may be insufficient for skill transfer in a sophisticated environment. In this paper, physical haptic feedback mechanism is introduced to result in muscle activity that would generate EMG signals in a natural manner, in order to achieve intuitive human impedance transfer through a designed coupling interface. Relevant processing methods are integrated into the system, including the spectral collaborative representation-based classifications method used for hand motion recognition; fast smooth envelop and dimensionality reduction algorithm for arm endpoint stiffness estimation. The tutor's arm endpoint motion trajectory is directly transferred to the robot by the designed coupling module without the restriction of hands. Haptic feedback is provided to the human tutor according to skill learning performance to enhance the teaching experience. The interface has been experimentally tested by a plugging-in task and a cutting task. Compared with the existing interfaces, the developed one has shown a better performance.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2017.2743000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856/8246664/08036245.pdf","startPage":"329","endPage":"340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8246664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2017.2743000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interface Design of a Physical Human\u2013Robot Interaction System for Human Impedance Adaptive Skill Transfer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Interface Design of a Physical Human\u2013Robot Interaction System for Human Impedance Adaptive Skill Transfer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036245/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17525705","htmlLink":"/document/8036245/","volume":"15","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation","grantNumber":"61473120"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014A030313266"},{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Collaboration","grantNumber":"2015A050502017"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou","grantNumber":"201607010006"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System","grantNumber":"SKLRS-2017-KF-13"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2017ZD057"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interface Design of a Physical Human\u2013Robot Interaction System for Human Impedance Adaptive Skill Transfer","sourcePdf":"tase-yang-2743000-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135412S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"8246664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8246664","articleId":"8036245","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8036259,"authors":[{"name":"Ying He","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada","School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8103982/8036259/he-2751641-small.gif","p":["Ying He (S\u201916) received the B.S. degree from Dalian Ocean\n University, Dalian, China, and the M.S. degree from Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, in 2011 and 2015,\n respectively, both in communication and information systems.

Nevertheless, most of the existing works on cache-enabled IA wireless networks assume that the channel is invariant, which is unrealistic considering the time-varying nature of practical wireless environments. In this paper, we consider realistic time-varying channels. Specifically, the channel is formulated as a finite-state Markov channel (FSMC). The complexity of the system is very high when we consider realistic FSMC models. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach, which is an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a deep Q network to approximate the Q value-action function. We use Google TensorFlow to implement deep reinforcement learning in this paper to obtain the optimal IA user selection policy in cache-enabled opportunistic IA wireless networks. Simulation results are presented to show that the performance of cache-enabled opportunistic IA networks in terms of the network's sum rate and energy efficiency can be significantly improved by using the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036259/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","volume":"66","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"17372544","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8036259/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based Optimization for Cache-Enabled Opportunistic Interference Alignment Wireless Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Xinghai Scholars Program"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT17JC43"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771089 and 61671101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based Optimization for Cache-Enabled Opportunistic Interference Alignment Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-yu-2751641-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13265S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8103982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"8103982","articleId":"8036259","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8036261,"authors":[{"name":"Qianwen Xu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8595470/8036261/xu-2751755-small.gif","p":["Qianwen Xu (S\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Tianjin University, China, in 2014.

These power electronic loads, when tightly controlled, behave as constant power loads (CPLs) and may cause system instability when interacting with their source converters. In this paper, a composite nonlinear controller is proposed for stabilizing dc/dc boost converter feeding CPLs by integrating a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO)-based feedforward compensation with backstepping design algorithm. First, the model is transformed into the Brunovsky's canonical form using the exact feedback linearization technique, to handle the nonlinearity introduced by the CPL. Second, the NDO technique is adopted to estimate the load power variation within a fast dynamic response, serving as a feedforward compensation to increase the accuracy of output voltage regulation. Then a nonlinear controller is developed by following the step-by-step backstepping algorithm with strictly guaranteed large signal stability. The proposed controller not only ensures global stability under large variation of the CPL but also features fast dynamic response with accurate tracking over wide operating range. Both simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the proposed strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2017.2751755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8595470/08036261.pdf","startPage":"752","endPage":"761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8595470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2017.2751755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Composite Nonlinear Controller for Stabilization of Constant Power Load in DC Microgrid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Composite Nonlinear Controller for Stabilization of Constant Power Load in DC Microgrid","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036261/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18339652","htmlLink":"/document/8036261/","volume":"10","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503236"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003395","fundingName":"Shanghai Municipal Education Commission","grantNumber":"15CG56"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Composite Nonlinear Controller for Stabilization of Constant Power Load in DC Microgrid","sourcePdf":"tsg-zhang-2751755-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067778S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8595470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"8595470","articleId":"8036261","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8036262,"authors":[{"name":"Ankit Garg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8258580/8036262/garg-2751599-small.gif","p":["Ankit Garg (S\u201915) received the AMIETE degree (Hons.) in electronics and telecommunication engineering from the Institution of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering (IETE), Delhi, in 2010 and the M.

It is well known that a feedback-based precoding scheme aids channel adaptive signaling in wireless communication system and capitulates large improvements in almost all performance metrics. However, a practical feedback link is susceptible to error due to wireless channel fading and leads to wrong precoder selection. Therefore, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptive error-tolerant weighting scheme is introduced which provides significant gain in comparison with another proposed arbitrarily fixed SNR error-tolerant weighting scheme. At first, a tight approximate closed-form expression of average symbol-error-rate (SER) and an exact analytical expression of outage probability are derived under imperfect feedback information with the help of order statistics. By minimizing the derived average SER, optimized transmit weights for the diagonal precoding matrix (based on feedback bits) are obtained. Later, a closed-form expression of the ergodic capacity with erroneous feedback bits for arbitrary MISO system is also provided by using the moment generating function approach. Further, numerical results show that the considered error-tolerant schemes outperform the uniform power allocation scheme in term of all the investigated performance metrics.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2751599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2751599","startPage":"91","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8258580/08036262.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8258580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantized Feedback-Based Diagonal Precoding for $N \\times 1$ MISO System With Generalized Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Quantized Feedback-Based Diagonal Precoding for $N \\times 1$ MISO System With Generalized Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes","volume":"66","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17519930","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8036262/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001843","fundingName":"Media Lab Asia (Sir Visvesvaraya Young Faculty Research Fellowship) under the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India and Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India","grantNumber":"EMR/2016/000592"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantized Feedback-Based Diagonal Precoding for $N \\times 1$ MISO System With Generalized Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes","sourcePdf":"tcomm-bhatnagar-2751599-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074038S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8258580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8258580","articleId":"8036262","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8036265,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8258580/8036265/moham-2751608-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri (S\u201916) received the B.Sc. degree (Hons.) in electrical engineering from the Iran University of Science and Technology in 2011, and the M.Sc. degree (Hons.) in electrical engineering from the University of Tehran in 2014.

The receivers are divided into two sets with regards to their channel qualities: the weak and the strong receivers, where all the weak receivers have statistically worse channel qualities than all the strong receivers. The weak receivers, in order to compensate for the high erasure probability they encounter over the channel, are equipped with cache memories of equal size, while the receivers in the strong set have no caches. Data can be pre-delivered to the weak receivers' caches over the off-peak traffic period before the receivers reveal their demands. Allowing arbitrary erasure probabilities for the weak and strong receivers, a joint caching and channel coding scheme, which divides each file into several subfiles, and applies a different caching and delivery scheme for each subfile, is proposed. It is shown that all the receivers, even those without any cache memories, benefit from the presence of caches across the network. An information theoretic tradeoff between the cache size and the achievable rate is formulated. It is shown that the proposed scheme improves upon the state-of-the-art in terms of the achievable tradeoff.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2751608","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8258580/08036265.pdf","startPage":"370","endPage":"381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8258580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2751608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cache-Aided Content Delivery Over Erasure Broadcast Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Cache-Aided Content Delivery Over Erasure Broadcast Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036265/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17519953","htmlLink":"/document/8036265/","volume":"66","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010663","fundingName":"European Union\u2019s H2020 Research and Innovation Programme through project TACTILENet: Towards Agile, effiCient, auTonomous and massIvely LargE Network of things and from the European Research Council (ERC) through Starting Grant BEACON","grantNumber":"690893 and 677854"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache-Aided Content Delivery Over Erasure Broadcast Channels","sourcePdf":"tcomm-mohammadiamiri-2751608-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.182382S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8258580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8258580","articleId":"8036265","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8036267,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Pareschi","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy","Advanced Research Center on Electronic Systems, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/8241892/8036267/pares-2740059-small.gif","p":["Fabio Pareschi (S\u201905\u2013M\u201908) received the Dr.Eng.\n degree (Hons.) in electronic engineering from University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy, in 2001, and the Ph.D. in\n information technology under the European Doctorate Project from University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 2007.

This is due to the fact the CS is capable of reducing the amount of data to be transmitted to ensure correct reconstruction of the acquired waveforms. Rakeness-based CS has been introduced to further reduce the amount of transmitted data by exploiting the uneven distribution to the sensed signal energy. Yet, so far no thorough analysis exists on the impact of its adoption on CS decoder performance. The latter point is of great importance, since body-area sensor network architectures may include intermediate gateway nodes that receive and reconstruct signals to provide local services before relaying data to a remote server. In this paper, we fill this gap by showing that rakeness-based design also improves reconstruction performance. We quantify these findings in the case of ECG signals and when a variety of reconstruction algorithms are used either in a low-power microcontroller or a heterogeneous mobile computing platform.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Analysis of Decoders for Rakeness-Based Compressed Sensing of ECG Signals","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2017.2740059","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/8241892/08036267.pdf","startPage":"1278","endPage":"1289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2017.2740059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8241892","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036267/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy Analysis of Decoders for Rakeness-Based Compressed Sensing of ECG Signals","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8036267/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17436202","pubMedId":"28920907","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Analysis of Decoders for Rakeness-Based Compressed Sensing of ECG Signals","sourcePdf":"tbcas-pareschi-2740059-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162756S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"8241892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8241892","articleId":"8036267","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8036270,"authors":[{"name":"Linlin Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Knowledge Automation for Industrial Processes of Ministry of Education, School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/8424402/8036270/li-2752136-small.gif","p":["Linlin Li (M\u201917) received the B.E. degree in automation from\n Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2008, the M.E. degree in mechanical systems and control from\n Peking University, China, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in control engineering from the Institute for Automatic\n Control and Complex Systems, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany, in 2015.","Since 2016, she has been a Postdoctoral Researcher with the School of Automation and Electrical Engineering,\n University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China.

In the first part, a data-driven method for fuzzy process modeling is proposed, and associated with it, some modeling issues are addressed with the aid of the so-called randomized algorithm technique in the probabilistic framework. It is followed by a data-driven realization of fuzzy kernel representation and its implementation in the fault detection system design. To link the data-driven methods to the well-established observer-based fault detection approaches, the recursive form of the fuzzy kernel representation is proposed. In the second part, the fuzzy-observer-based fault detection design scheme is investigated based on the recursive fuzzy kernel representation. The main results of our study are illustrated by an experimental study on the laboratory setup of a three-tank system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Kernel","Fault detection","Data models","Mathematical model","Analytical models","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","fault diagnosis","fuzzy control","fuzzy set theory","fuzzy systems","nonlinear control systems","observers","tanks (containers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault detection approach","nonlinear systems","data-driven realization","data-driven fault detection","kernel representations","data-driven method","fuzzy process modeling","fault detection system design","fuzzy-observer-based fault detection design scheme","recursive fuzzy kernel representation","three-tank system","Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy data-driven forms","randomized algorithm technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data-driven methods","fuzzy fault detection schemes","kernel representation","observer-based fault detection","randomized algorithms (RAs)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2752136","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/8424402/08036270.pdf","startPage":"1800","endPage":"1812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8424402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2752136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fault Detection Approach for Nonlinear Systems Based on Data-Driven Realizations of Fuzzy Kernel Representations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Fault Detection Approach for Nonlinear Systems Based on Data-Driven Realizations of Fuzzy Kernel Representations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036270/","volume":"26","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8036270/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17973497","dateOfInsertion":"02 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","grantNumber":"DI773-15"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61603033, 61633001, 61522306 and 61473033"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"4174096"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fault Detection Approach for Nonlinear Systems Based on Data-Driven Realizations of Fuzzy Kernel Representations","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-li-2752136-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15069S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"8424402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8424402","articleId":"8036270","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":8036271,"authors":[{"name":"Guofa Cai","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China","School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8290782/8036271/cai-2751754-small.gif","p":["Guofa Cai (M\u201917) received the Ph.D. degree in communication\n engineering from Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, in 2015, the M.Sc. degree in circuits and systems from Fuzhou\n University, Fuzhou, China, in 2012, and the B.Sc. degree in communication engineering from Jimei University, Xiamen,\n China, in 2007.

First, a decode-and-forward protocol is considered, when the two relays first decode the two users' orthogonal transmitted signals and then forward their XORed version back to the users. Based on the equal-gain-combining method at the receiver of each user, the bit-error-rate (BER), achievable diversity order, and throughput are analyzed. It is shown that, as compared to the conventional two-way one-relay network-coded DCSK system, the proposed system achieves lower BER, but reduces the throughput meanwhile. To improve the overall performance and avoid the throughput loss, a novel relay-selection criterion is developed based on the decision metrics used for conventional symbol detection, which can be implemented without requiring the channel state information. According to the criterion, three relay-selection strategies are suggested, namely the max-sum, max-product and max-min relay selections. Both analytical and simulated results show that the proposed relay-selection strategies significantly improve the BER and throughput of the two-way two-relay network-coded DCSK system and achieve higher diversity order. As a further insight, the superiority of the proposed relay-selection strategies is demonstrated in multirelay scenarios. Overall, the proposed system stands out as a promising candidate for low-power and low-complexity short-range wireless-communication applications, such as wireless sensor networks.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2751754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2751754","startPage":"1258","endPage":"1271","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8290782/08036271.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8290782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of Relay-Selection Strategies for Two-Way Relay Network-Coded DCSK Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of Relay-Selection Strategies for Two-Way Relay Network-Coded DCSK Systems","volume":"67","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","accessionNumber":"17577964","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8036271/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701121, 61771149, 61471131 and 61501126"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grants","grantNumber":"CityU 11234916"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program","grantNumber":"2014ZT05G157"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou","grantNumber":"201607010155"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme (2017)"},{"fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2017M612612"},{"fundingName":"National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2018D02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of Relay-Selection Strategies for Two-Way Relay Network-Coded DCSK Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-fang-2751754-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115925S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8290782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8290782","articleId":"8036271","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8036273,"authors":[{"name":"An-Yang Lu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"An-Yang","lastName":"Lu","orcid":"0000-0002-9132-3483","id":"37086381445"},{"name":"Guang-Hong Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries and the College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Guang-Hong","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-8911-0112","id":"37085392421"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"8036273","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2895},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer crime","Control systems","Cyber-physical systems","Stability criteria","Switched systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","computer network security","control system synthesis","cyber-physical systems","linear matrix inequalities","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyber-physical systems","multiple transmission channels","input-to-state stabilizing control problem","CPSs","denial-of-service attacks","data update policy","bounded update interval","control scheme","stability analysis","DoS attacks","switched controller","switched systems","closed-loop systems","single-channel case","multiple-channel case"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cyber-physical systems (CPSs)","denial-of-service (DoS) attack","input-to-state stability","multiple transmission channels"]}],"abstract":"This paper is concerned with the input-to-state stabilizing control problem for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with multiple transmission channels under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

Our PF-based training method guarantees convergence to the optimal parameter estimation in the mean square error sense provided that we have a sufficient number of particles and satisfy certain technical conditions. More importantly, we achieve this performance with a computational complexity in the order of the first-order gradient-based methods by controlling the number of particles. Since our approach is generic, we also introduce a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based approach by directly replacing the LSTM architecture with the GRU architecture, where we demonstrate the superiority of our LSTM-based approach in the sequential prediction task via different real life data sets.

However, the performance degrades in the presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO). The impact of CFO can be mitigated by compensating the estimated CFO values obtained using CFO estimators. Yet, CFO estimators in literature cannot work well in wideband TR systems due to the fact that the normalized CFO values are very small and thus cannot be estimated accurately using conventional schemes. To address this issue, we propose four CFO estimators which are capable of accurate CFO estimations for wideband TR systems. The theoretical performances of the proposed estimators are analyzed. Additionally, realizing that phase wrapping might introduce severe bias into CFO estimations, we present the conditions on the system parameters so that phase wrapping can be avoided. Extensive simulations and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2751609","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8359223/08036286.pdf","startPage":"2191","endPage":"2205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8359223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2751609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Resolution Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation in Time-Reversal Wideband Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","displayDocTitle":"High Resolution Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation in Time-Reversal Wideband Communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036286/","publicationDate":"May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17754519","htmlLink":"/document/8036286/","volume":"66","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Resolution Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation in Time-Reversal Wideband Communications","sourcePdf":"tcomm-chen-2751609-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126504S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8359223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8359223","articleId":"8036286","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8036292,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Liu","affiliation":["TL, NTU, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8118264/8036292/liu-2747132-small.gif","p":["Qing Liu (S\u201915) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree (part-time).","He is currently a Research Associate with Temasek Laboratories, Nanyang Technological University.

A small number of spatiotemporal fusion methods that use sparse representation appear to be more promising than weighted- and unmixing-based methods in reflecting abruptly changing terrestrial content. However, none of the existing dictionary-based fusion methods consider the downsampling process explicitly, which is the degradation and sparse observation from high-resolution images to the corresponding low-resolution images. In this paper, the downsampling process is described explicitly under the framework of compressed sensing for reconstruction. With the coupled dictionary to constrain the similarity of sparse coefficients, a new dictionary-based spatiotemporal fusion method is built and named compressed sensing for spatiotemporal fusion, for the spatiotemporal fusion of remote sensing images. To deal with images with a high-resolution difference, typically Landsat-7 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), the proposed model is performed twice to shorten the gap between the small block size and the large resolution rate. In the experimental procedure, the near-infrared, red, and green bands of Landsat-7 and MODIS are fused with root mean square errors to check the prediction accuracy. It can be concluded from the experiment that the proposed methods can produce higher quality than five state-of-the-art methods, which prove the feasibility of incorporating the downsampling process in the spatiotemporal model under the framework of compressed sensing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatiotemporal Fusion of MODIS and Landsat-7 Reflectance Images via Compressed Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2017.2742529","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8118236/08036397.pdf","startPage":"7126","endPage":"7139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2742529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8118236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036397/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Spatiotemporal Fusion of MODIS and Landsat-7 Reflectance Images via Compressed Sensing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8036397/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17376886","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41571413 and 41471368"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016M591280"},{"fundingName":"Special Fund for the Development Plan of the Young Teachers in the Ordinary Universities of Jiangxi Province"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Open Research Fund of Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science, Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"2015LDE004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatiotemporal Fusion of MODIS and Landsat-7 Reflectance Images via Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tgrs-wang-2742529-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183969S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8118236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8118236","articleId":"8036397","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8036400,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Zhao","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8240806/8036400/zhao-2744178-small.gif","p":["Bo Zhao (M\u201915) was born in Henan, China, in 1986.

Since the deceptive jammings are usually confined to the main lobe of an SAR antenna, their time-frequency distributions are different from those of the true echoes. This enables us to utilize a dynamic synthetic aperture (DSA) scheme to extract the characteristics of the true and false targets. Dictionaries about the true and false targets are constructed by taking interactions between scatterers into account. Then a sparsity-driven optimization problem is solved to reconstruct the true and false targets separately with super-resolution. Moreover, the deceptively jammed SAR data are divided into different areas to handle various scenarios efficiently, and strategies for DSA selection are addressed as well. Simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2017.2744178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2744178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8240806","startPage":"152","endPage":"167","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

First, a formal description language is defined to accurately model the different components of cloud application, and use it to characterize the operational mechanisms and fault behaviors. Second, we propose a fault tolerant strategy, which includes the scheduling mechanism, synchronization mechanism, and exception mechanism, to dynamically compute the execution mode and required virtual machine for tasks, thus ensuring the reliability and real-time requirement of cloud application. An enforcement algorithm is also designed to realize the proposed strategy. Third, the techniques of Petri nets are provided to analyze and validate the correctness of proposed method.

Specifically, we first warp the original satellite image into multiple different scales. The images in each scale are employed to train a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). However, simultaneously training multiple DCNNs is time-consuming. To address this issue, we explore DCNN with spatial pyramid pooling (SPP-net). Since different SPP-nets have the same number of parameters, which share the identical initial values, and only fine-tuning the parameters in fully connected layers ensures the effectiveness of each network, thereby greatly accelerating the training process. Then, the multiscale satellite images are fed into their corresponding SPP-nets, respectively, to extract multiscale deep features. Finally, a multiple kernel learning method is developed to automatically learn the optimal combination of such features. Experiments on two difficult data sets show that the proposed method achieves favorable performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2017.2743243","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8240806/08036413.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2743243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8240806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Multiscale Deep Features for High-Resolution Satellite Image Scene Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036413/","displayDocTitle":"Learning Multiscale Deep Features for High-Resolution Satellite Image Scene Classification","volume":"56","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17468512","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8036413/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61532009 and 41501377"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China","grantNumber":"15KJA520001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Multiscale Deep Features for High-Resolution Satellite Image Scene Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-hang-2743243-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057113S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8240806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8240806","articleId":"8036413","onlineDate":"13 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":8036655,"authors":[{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, KR"],"firstName":"Jinho","lastName":"Choi"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1229-2370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1976-5541"}],"articleNumber":"8036655","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":653},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","NOMA","Downlink","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Silicon carbide","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","correlation methods","encoding","interference suppression","mathematical programming","multi-access systems","radio spectrum management","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized downlink beamforming","nonorthogonal multiple access","spectral efficiency","multiuser system","superposition coding","successive interference cancellation","SIC","downlink transmissions","base station","antenna array","multiuser NOMA beamforming problem","semidefinite programming problem","SDP problem","multiuser beamforming","correlation","channel vectors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Downlink beamforming","nonorthogonal multiple access(NOMA)","semidefinite programming","superposition coding"]}],"abstract":"Recently, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been studied to increase the spectral efficiency of downlink in a multiuser system by exploiting the notion of superposition coding with successive interference cancellation (SIC).

In this paper, we formulate a multiuser NOMA beamforming problem as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem and generalize it in order to include the conventional (multiuser) beamforming. A low-complexity approach to decide SIC sets for the generalized NOMA beamforming is studied using the correlation between channel vectors for better performance.

Since WISPs need to be fully charged and then can start communication with the reader, thus the energy charging and transmission collision of WISPs are different from those of RFID tags. If the reader power is large, WISPs will be charged fast and start data transmission almost at the same time, which results in heavy transmission collision and the communication delay would be extremely large. However, if the reader power is small, WISPs will be charged slow and start data transmission one by one even without collisionh between any two WISPs, but the charging period of the whole network would be extremely large. Therefore, this paper aims at determining an optimal reader power towards balanced energy charging and transmission collision, such that the total duration for all WISPs to be fully charged and completely communicated is minimized. Firstly, we investigate on dynamic reader power with transmission collision avoidance, and static reader power towards balanced energy charging and transmission collision. Then, we derive the optimal reader power in three cases: (i) One reader and ray-uniformly distributed WISPs; (ii) one reader and randomly distributed WISPs; and (iii) multiple readers and randomly distributed WISPs. Finally, the theoretical analysis is verified through extensive evaluations.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2017.000058","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/8036653/08036657.pdf","startPage":"341","endPage":"350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2017.000058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards balanced energy charging and transmission collision in wireless rechargeable sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036657/","displayDocTitle":"Towards balanced energy charging and transmission collision in wireless rechargeable sensor networks","volume":"19","issue":"4","publicationDate":"August 2017","accessionNumber":"17171316","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards balanced energy charging and transmission collision in wireless rechargeable sensor networks","sourcePdf":"341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072977S","chronDate":"August  2017","isNumber":"8036653","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"15","articleId":"8036657","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8036658,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Xie","affiliation":["PLA University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xie"},{"name":"Xiaochen Xia","affiliation":["PLA University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Xiaochen","lastName":"Xia"},{"name":"Youyun Xu","affiliation":["National Engineering Research Center of Communication and Network Technologies, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and Institute ofWireless Communication Technology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Youyun","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Kui Xu","affiliation":["PLA University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Yurong Wang","affiliation":["PLA University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Yurong","lastName":"Wang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1229-2370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1976-5541"}],"articleNumber":"8036658","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":345},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Hardware","Distortion","MIMO","Antenna arrays","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","power control","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO full-duplex relaying","hardware impairments","end-to-end achievable rate","echo interference","multiuser interference","relay antenna","low-complexity power control scheme","spectral-energy efficiency tradeoff"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Achievable rate","full-duplex relaying","hardwareimpairments","massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)","power control"]}],"abstract":"Massive multiple-input-multiple-output full-duplex relaying (MM-FDR), which exploits both the benefits of large-scale antenna arrays and full-duplex transmission, is considered as a promising technology to achieve very high spectral efficiency in the future wireless network. Despite the inevitable presence of transceiver impairments due to the use of low-cost hardware components, most of the prior works on MM-FDR assume perfect transceiver hardware which is unrealistic in practice. This paper investigates the impact of hardware impairments on the MM-FDR. Based on the recent experimental results, the effect of hardware impairments is modeled using transmit and receive distortion noises. The end-to-end achievable rate is derived and the scaling behaviors of echo interference due to the full-duplex operation, multi-user interference and effective distortions caused by hardware impairments are obtained. The scaling results show that the achievable rate of MM-FDR is limited by the hardware impairments at the sources and destinations, instead of that at the relay or other interferences, as the number of relay antenna tends to infinity. A low-complexity power control scheme is proposed to further improve the energy efficiency of MM-FDR with hardware impairments. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can improve the spectral-energy efficiency tradeoff significantly.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2017.000059","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/8036653/08036658.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2017.000059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036653","startPage":"351","endPage":"362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massive MIMO full-duplex relaying with hardware impairments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO full-duplex relaying with hardware impairments","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036658/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"4","publicationDate":"August 2017","accessionNumber":"17171319","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive MIMO full-duplex relaying with hardware impairments","sourcePdf":"351.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056621S","chronDate":"August  2017","isNumber":"8036653","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8036658","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8036660,"authors":[{"name":"Anzhong Hu","affiliation":["School of Communication Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University"],"firstName":"Anzhong","lastName":"Hu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1229-2370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1976-5541"}],"articleNumber":"8036660","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Antennas","Uplink","Interference","Millimeter wave technology","Manifolds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamspace channels","ICI channels","millimeter-wave multi-cell beamspace multiple-input multiple-output systems","inter-cell interference","millimeter-wave multi-cell beamspace MIMO systems","interference mitigation","channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamspace","channel estimation","millimeter-wave(mm-wave)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with the inter-cell interference (ICI) mitigation in the channel estimation process of millimeter-wave multi-cell beamspace multiple-input multiple-output systems.

Virtualization, a key cloud computing technology, allows service providers to offer computing services in cloud environments without platform compatibility discrepancies. The recent proliferation of cloud computing has rekindled interest in network virtualization. Thus, network virtualization is emerging as a polymorphic approach for the future Internet that will facilitate the use of shared resources. Virtual network provisioning is considered to be a main resource allocation challenge in any virtualized network environment. Software-defined networking (SDN) imparts flexibility to a network by removing the control layer from the data transfer layer of the network and moving it to the control plane. Network virtualization is further employed to share physical infrastructure to enable multiple service providers to access the network. Flexible access requires efficient management of network resources; the SDN control plane can be used for efficient management of virtual networks. In this study, we formulate virtual network provisioning in SDN-enabled, geographically distributed cloud computing datacenters as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The formulation of the proposed optimized virtual network provisioning (OVNP) model is studied by means of simulations. The performance of the proposed approach is measured against enhanced network cloud provisioning (ENCP), our previous research, and other recognized research focused on the ratio of successfully provisioned requests and the efficiency of resource utilization The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized provisioning of SDN-enabled virtual networks in geo-distributed cloud computing datacenters","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2017.000064","startPage":"402","endPage":"415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2017.000064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036653","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/8036653/08036663.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimized provisioning of SDN-enabled virtual networks in geo-distributed cloud computing datacenters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2017","accessionNumber":"17171315","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized provisioning of SDN-enabled virtual networks in geo-distributed cloud computing datacenters","sourcePdf":"402.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02539S","chronDate":"August  2017","isNumber":"8036653","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"4","articleId":"8036663","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8036688,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Mari","affiliation":["Cattaneo University \u2014 LIUC, Castellanza, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Luca Mari is a Full Professor of measurement science at the Cattaneo University \u2014 LIUC, Castellanza, Italy, where he teaches courses on measurement science, statistical data analysis, and system theory.

Moreover, massive amounts of data can be collected very efficiently- sometimes at zero marginal costs from the internet. The concept of Big Data (BD) epitomizes this phenomenon among the experts and the general public (for an accessible, application-oriented introduction to BD in the broad context of data science).This paper aimed at showing that a sound knowledge of measurement fundamentals can be helpful in managing such a risk, since it makes people aware about possible uncertainty sources and their effect on the confidence of the conclusions they draw.

One promising application of such a network is wearable health monitoring where the collected data from the sensors would be transmitted and analyzed to assess the health of a person. Typically, the devices in a BAN are connected through wireless (WBAN), which suffers from energy inefficiency due to the high-energy consumption of wireless transmission. Human Body Communication (HBC) uses the relatively low loss human body as the communication medium to connect these devices, promising order(s) of magnitude better energy-efficiency and built-in security compared to WBAN. In this paper, we demonstrate a health monitoring device and system built using Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) sensors and components, that can collect data from physiological sensors and transmit it through a) intra-body HBC to another device (hub) worn on the body or b) upload health data through HBC-based human-machine interaction to an HBC capable machine. The system design constraints and signal transfer characteristics for the implemented HBC-based wearable health monitoring system are measured and analyzed, showing reliable connectivity with >8\u00d7 power savings compared to Bluetooth low-energy (BTLE).","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08036748.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036748","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wearable health monitoring using capacitive voltage-mode Human Body Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wearable health monitoring using capacitive voltage-mode Human Body Communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036748/","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8036748/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17175213","pubMedId":"29059795","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wearable health monitoring using capacitive voltage-mode Human Body Communication","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"00111666.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084623S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8036748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8036767,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Parsa","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Parsa","id":"38467047000"},{"name":"Priyadarshini Panda","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Priyadarshini","lastName":"Panda","id":"37085624150"},{"name":"Shreyas Sen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Shreyas","lastName":"Sen","id":"37322064300"},{"name":"Kaushik Roy","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Roy","id":"37274519700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8036767","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":535},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036767","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real-time systems","Machine learning","Biomedical monitoring","Performance evaluation","Diseases","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical communication","diseases","health care","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical computing","neural nets","patient diagnosis","patient monitoring","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart diagnosis","biosensor technology","wearable devices","remote health care monitoring systems","disease prevention","data mining techniques","health care applications","disease diagnosis","conventional deep neural networks","Staged Inference using Conditional Deep Learning","SICDL","cardio disease","physiological sensor data","Physionet databases"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Conditioning, Classical","Data Mining","Humans","Machine Learning","Neural Networks (Computer)"]}],"abstract":"Recent progress in biosensor technology and wearable devices has created a formidable opportunity for remote healthcare monitoring systems as well as real-time diagnosis and disease prevention. The use of data mining techniques is indispensable for analysis of the large pool of data generated by the wearable devices. Deep learning is among the promising methods for analyzing such data for healthcare applications and disease diagnosis. However, the conventional deep neural networks are computationally intensive and it is impractical to use them in real-time diagnosis with low-powered on-body devices. We propose Staged Inference using Conditional Deep Learning (SICDL), as an energy efficient approach for creating healthcare monitoring systems. For smart diagnostics, we observe that all diagnoses are not equally challenging. The proposed approach thus decomposes the diagnoses into preliminary analysis (such as healthy vs unhealthy) and detailed analysis (such as identifying the specific type of cardio disease). The preliminary diagnosis is conducted real-time with a low complexity neural network realized on the resource-constrained on-body device. The detailed diagnosis requires a larger network that is implemented remotely in cloud and is conditionally activated only for detailed diagnosis (unhealthy individuals). We evaluated the proposed approach using available physiological sensor data from Physionet databases, and achieved 38% energy reduction in comparison to the conventional deep learning approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036767","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering

Stimulus can be implemented through optoelectronic probes. The long term target is for both fundamental neuroscience applications and for clinical use in treating epilepsy. Utilizing our device, closed-loop processing consumes only 14nJ of power per PID cycle compared to 1.52\u03bcJ per cycle for a micro-controller implementation.

Consequently, the implemented system meets crucial embedded systems constraints of high performance and low cost, resources utilization and power consumption, while achieving high classification accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08036814.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"274","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SVM classifier on chip for melanoma detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","IP networks","Malignant tumors","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Tools","Embedded systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","cancer","field programmable gate arrays","image classification","medical image processing","optimisation","power consumption","skin","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SVM classifier-on-chip","melanoma detection","support vector machine","clinical images","computer-aided diagnosis systems","skin cancer specialists","medical low-cost handheld device","real-time embedded SVM-based diagnosis system","primary care","optimized SVM classifier","FPGA platform","latest design methodology","online efficient melanoma detection","classification accuracy","acceleration factor","equivalent software implementation","embedded processor","resources utilization","power consumption","embedded systems"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Early Detection of Cancer","Humans","Melanoma","Skin Neoplasms","Support Vector Machine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"SVM classifier on chip for melanoma detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8036814/","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17189538","pubMedId":"29059862","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SVM classifier on chip for melanoma detection","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01070447.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058718S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8036814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8036839,"authors":[{"name":"Dhimas Arief Dharmawan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Dhimas Arief","lastName":"Dharmawan","id":"37085561157"},{"name":"Boon Poh Ng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Boon Poh","lastName":"Ng","id":"37287443000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8036839","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036839","abstract":"Retinal vessel segmentation takes a significant part in an automated diabetic retinopathy screening task. However, this can be a challenging job because of the low contrast retinal images and the presences of retinal pathologies. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel matched filter based on the modified Chebyshev type I function for retinal blood vessels candidates detection. The proposed method is combined with the pre-processing and the post-processing phases to have a complete retinal vessel segmentation scheme. The retinal images from the DRIVE and STARE databases, which are equipped with the ground truths are used to evaluate our proposed method in the segmentation scheme. Using our method, the achieved average levels of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are 0.756, 0.973, and 0.954, for the DRIVE database, and 0.731, 0.972, and 0.953, for the STARE database, being better than other presented methods. The high results indicate that our method is reliable to be used in an automated detection tool for diabetic retinopathy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Retinal vessels","Databases","Chebyshev approximation","Diabetes","Image segmentation","Retinopathy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","blood vessels","Chebyshev filters","diseases","eye","image filtering","image segmentation","matched filters","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional matched filter","modified Chebyshev type I function","retinal vessels detection","retinal vessel segmentation","automated diabetic retinopathy screening task","low contrast retinal images","retinal pathologies","DRIVE databases","STARE databases","ground truths"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Databases, Factual","Diabetic Retinopathy","Retinal Vessels"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036839","startPage":"369","endPage":"372","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08036839.pdf","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new two-dimensional matched filter based on the modified Chebyshev type I function for retinal vessels detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new two-dimensional matched filter based on the modified Chebyshev type I function for retinal vessels detection","accessionNumber":"17175133","pubMedId":"29059887","publicationDate":"July 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8036839/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new two-dimensional matched filter based on the modified Chebyshev type I function for retinal vessels detection","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01320308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115869S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8036839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8036864,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Michael Krell","affiliation":["Robotics Group, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany","International Computer Science Institute, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Mario Michael","lastName":"Krell","id":"37085429059"},{"name":"Su Kyoung Kim","affiliation":["Robotics Innovation Center (RIC), German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) GmbH, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Su Kyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37964753300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8036864","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":818},"abstract":"Motivation: For deep learning on image data, a common approach is to augment the training data by artificial new images, using techniques like moving windows, scaling, affine distortions, and elastic deformations. In contrast to image data, electroencephalographic (EEG) data suffers even more from the lack of sufficient training data. Methods: We suggest and evaluate rotational distortions similar to affine/rotational distortions of images to generate augmented data. Results: Our approach increases the performance of signal processing chains for EEG-based brain-computer interfaces when rotating only around y- and z-axis with an angle around \u00b118 degrees to generate new data. Conclusion: This shows that our processing efficient approach generates meaningful data and encourages to look for further new methods for EEG data augmentation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08036864.pdf","startPage":"471","endPage":"474","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotational data augmentation for electroencephalographic data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Electrodes","Standards","Training data","Distortion","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","elastic deformation","electroencephalography","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rotational data augmentation","electroencephalographic data","deep learning","image data","artificial new images","moving windows","scaling","affine distortions","elastic deformations","rotational distortions","signal processing chains","EEG-based brain-computer interfaces"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Brain-Computer Interfaces","Electroencephalography","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Rotational data augmentation for electroencephalographic data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8036864/","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17175065","pubMedId":"29059912","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotational data augmentation for electroencephalographic data","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01570331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053023S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8036864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8036867,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Aroudi","affiliation":["Department of Medical Physics and Acoustics, University of Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Aroudi","id":"37085776879"},{"name":"Simon Doclo","affiliation":["Department of Medical Physics and Acoustics, University of Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Doclo","id":"37267398500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8036867","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036867","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Acoustics","Decoding","Training","Noise measurement","Electroencephalography","Ear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","filtering theory","hearing","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EEG-based auditory attention decoding","unprocessed binaural signals","reverberant conditions","reverberant mixture","acoustic conditions","reverberant-noisy conditions","anechoic conditions","background noise","filter training"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Acoustic Stimulation","Attention","Electroencephalography","Noise","Speech Perception"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036867","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08036867.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EEG-based auditory attention decoding using unprocessed binaural signals in reverberant and noisy conditions?","abstract":"To decode auditory attention from single-trial EEG recordings in an acoustic scenario with two competing speakers, a least-squares method has been recently proposed. This method however requires the clean speech signals of both the attended and the unattended speaker to be available as reference signals. Since in practice only the binaural signals consisting of a reverberant mixture of both speakers and background noise are available, in this paper we explore the potential of using these (unprocessed) signals as reference signals for decoding auditory attention in different acoustic conditions (anechoic, reverberant, noisy, and reverberant-noisy). In addition, we investigate whether it is possible to use these signals instead of the clean attended speech signal for filter training. The experimental results show that using the unprocessed binaural signals for filter training and for decoding auditory attention is feasible with a relatively large decoding performance, although for most acoustic conditions the decoding performance is significantly lower than when using the clean speech signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036867/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17189469","pubMedId":"29059915","publicationDate":"July 2017","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8036867/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"EEG-based auditory attention decoding using unprocessed binaural signals in reverberant and noisy conditions?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EEG-based auditory attention decoding using unprocessed binaural signals in reverberant and noisy conditions?","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01600871.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071773S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8036867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8036913,"authors":[{"name":"S Molaei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran","Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"S","lastName":"Molaei","id":"37085876920"},{"name":"ME Shiri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"ME","lastName":"Shiri","id":"37542532900"},{"name":"K Horan","affiliation":["Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","Ph.D. Program in Computer Science, CUNY, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"K","lastName":"Horan","id":"37086153183"},{"name":"D Kahrobaei","affiliation":["Ph.D. Program in Computer Science, CUNY, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"D","lastName":"Kahrobaei","id":"37086151505"},{"name":"B Nallamothu","affiliation":["Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"B","lastName":"Nallamothu","id":"37085755338"},{"name":"K Najarian","affiliation":["Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"K","lastName":"Najarian","id":"37266199200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8036913","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Magnetic resonance imaging","Manuals","Myocardium","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","cardiovascular system","diseases","Gabor filters","image segmentation","medical image processing","neural nets","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep convolutional neural networks","left ventricle segmentation","cardiac function analysis","endocardium segmentation","epicardium segmentation","cumbersome","end-diastolic phases","end-systolic phases","error prone manual initialization","fully-automated LV segmentation method","functional analysis","cardiac MRI images","deep convolutional neural network","Gabor filters","Gabor DCNN initialization"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Endocardium","Heart Ventricles","Humans","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Reproducibility of Results"]}],"abstract":"Left ventricle (LV) segmentation is crucial for quantitative cardiac function analysis. Manual segmentation of the endocardium and epicardium is highly cumbersome; physicians limit delineation to the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases. A fully automated system could provide an analysis of cardiac morphology for all phases in a much shorter time. Most of the current LV segmentation methods are semi-automated and require error prone manual initialization. A fully-automated LV segmentation method would expedite the functional analysis of the LV, reduce subjectivity and improve patient experience. We automatically segment the LV wall in cardiac MRI images with a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). This algorithm first calculates the probability of a pixel belonging to the LV wall or background and then generates a label based on those probabilities without manual initialization. We then compare these results to the results obtained with another DCNN initialization method using Gabor filters. With Gabor DCNN we obtain an accuracy of 0.97, specificity of 0.984, sensitivity of 0.841 and mean accuracy of 0.902. This shows that Gabor filters perform better than random filters in the DCNN for LV segmentation.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036913","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08036913.pdf","startPage":"668","endPage":"671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for left ventricle segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036913/","displayDocTitle":"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for left ventricle segmentation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8036913/","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17190040","pubMedId":"29059961","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for left ventricle segmentation","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"02061048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080903S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8036913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8036914,"authors":[{"name":"Young Hwan Chang","affiliation":["Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), Portland, OR"],"firstName":"Young Hwan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085692511"},{"name":"Guillaume Thibault","affiliation":["Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), Portland, OR"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Thibault","id":"37392214100"},{"name":"Owen Madin","affiliation":["Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), Portland, OR"],"firstName":"Owen","lastName":"Madin","id":"37086134495"},{"name":"Vahid Azimi","affiliation":["Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), Portland, OR"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Azimi","id":"37089046546"},{"name":"Cole Meyers","affiliation":["Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), Portland, OR"],"firstName":"Cole","lastName":"Meyers","id":"37086128315"},{"name":"Brett Johnson","affiliation":["Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), Portland, OR"],"firstName":"Brett","lastName":"Johnson","id":"37085898550"},{"name":"Jason Link","affiliation":["Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), Portland, OR"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Link","id":"37085902966"},{"name":"Adam Margolin","affiliation":["Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), Portland, OR"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Margolin","id":"37085903300"},{"name":"Joe W.

Specifically, the morphology of retinal vessels in patients is used as a measure of classification in retinal diseases and the automatic processing of fundus image has been investigated widely for diagnostic efficiency. The automatic segmentation of retinal vessels is essential and needs to precede computer-aided diagnosis system. In this study, we propose the method which implements patch-based pixel-wise segmentation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in fundus images for automatic retinal vessel segmentation. We construct the network composed of several modules which include convolutional layers and upsampling layers. Feature maps are made by modules and concatenated into a single feature map to capture coarse and fine structures of vessel simultaneously. The concatenated feature map is followed by a convolutional layer for performing a pixel-wise prediction. The performance of the proposed method is measured on DRIVE dataset. We show that our method is comparable to the results of other state-of-the-art algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036916","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08036916.pdf","startPage":"681","endPage":"684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8036916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Development of automatic retinal vessel segmentation method in fundus images via convolutional neural networks","isConference":true,"pubMedId":"29059964","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17189957","htmlLink":"/document/8036916/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of automatic retinal vessel segmentation method in fundus images via convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"02091123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.158254S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8036916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8036918,"authors":[{"name":"Egemen Sert","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Egemen","lastName":"Sert","id":"37086149821"},{"name":"Seyda Ertekin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey","MIT Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Seyda","lastName":"Ertekin","id":"38557655600"},{"name":"Ugur Halici","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering and Neuroscience and Neurotechnology Graduate Program, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ugur","lastName":"Halici","id":"37266118500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8036918","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":573},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mammography","Computational modeling","Training","Breast cancer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","diagnostic radiography","image classification","mammography","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural networks","image classification","breast microcalcification","mammograms","breast cancer","contrast scaling","dilation techniques","cropping techniques","decision fusion","digital database","mammography dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mammograms","microcalcification","deep learning","computer vision","convolutional neural networks","decision fusion","ensemble of networks"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Breast Diseases","Calcinosis","Humans","Mammography","Neural Networks (Computer)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8036918","abstract":"Human level recall performance in detecting breast cancer considering microcalcifications from mammograms has a recall value between 74.5% and 92.3%.

In this paper we present a novel hardware implementation for the capture and storage of a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. The LED duty cycle was altered to determine the effect on respiratory rate accuracy. The oximeter was mounted to the left index finger of ten healthy volunteers. The breathing rate derived from the oximeter was validated against a nasal airflow sensor. The duty cycle of a pulse oximeter was changed between 5%, 10% and 25% at a sample rate of 500 Hz. A PPG signal and reference signal was captured for each duty cycle. The PPG signals were post processed in Matlab to derive a respiration rate using an existing Matlab toolbox. At a 25% duty cycle the RMSE was <;2 breaths per minute for the top performing algorithm. The RMSE increased to over 5 breaths per minute when the duty cycle was reduced to 5%. The power consumed by the hardware for a 5%, 10% and 25% duty cycle was 5.4 mW, 7.8 mW, and 15 mW respectively. For clinical assessment of respiratory rate, a RSME of <;2 breaths per minute is recommended. Further work is required to determine utility in asthma management.

Model inputs are spatio-temporal patterns of spikes recorded in the hippocampal CA3 and CA1 regions of epilepsy patients performing a delayed match-to-sample (DMS) task. Model outputs are binary labels indicating categories and features of sample images. To solve the super high-dimensional estimation problem with short data length, we develop a multi-trial, sparse model estimation method utilizing B-spline basis functions with a large range of temporal resolutions and a regularized logistic classifier. Results show that this model can effectively avoid overfitting and provide significant amount of prediction to memory categories and features using very limited number of data points. Stable estimation of sparse classification function matrices for each label can be obtained with this multi-resolution, multi-trial procedure. These classification models can be used not only to predict memory contents, but also to design optimal spatio-temporal patterns for eliciting specific memories in the hippocampus, and thus have important implications to the development of hippocampal memory prostheses.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8037006/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17190064","pubMedId":"29060053","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi-resolution multi-trial sparse classification model for decoding visual memories from hippocampal spikes in human","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-resolution multi-trial sparse classification model for decoding visual memories from hippocampal spikes in human","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"03321085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042868S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8037016,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Haas","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Haas","id":"37085775578"},{"name":"Benedikt Schweizer","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Benedikt","lastName":"Schweizer","id":"37086077872"},{"name":"Jens Anders","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Anders","id":"37568332100"},{"name":"Maurits Ortmanns","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Maurits","lastName":"Ortmanns","id":"37085347218"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8037016","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":449},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037016","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Dipole antennas","Transmitting antennas","Skin","Receiving antennas","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical telemetry","neurophysiology","skin","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["miniaturized UWB antenna","implantable data telemetry","miniaturized impulse radio ultrawideband antenna","miniaturized IR-UWB antenna","data communication","multichannel neural recording","radiation efficiency","circularly polarized antenna","signal power variation","pulse generator","porcine skin"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Equipment Design","Prostheses and Implants","Telemetry","Wireless Technology"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037016","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037016.pdf","startPage":"1086","endPage":"1089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A miniaturized UWB antenna for implantable data telemetry","abstract":"This paper presents a miniaturized impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) antenna which is designed for transcutaneous, short-distance data communication used in multichannel neural recording.

Our proposed YOLO-based CAD system contains four main stages: mammograms preprocessing, feature extraction utilizing multi convolutional deep layers, mass detection with confidence model, and finally mass classification using fully connected neural network (FC-NN). A set of training mammograms with the information of ROI masses and their types are used to train YOLO. The trained YOLO-based CAD system detects the masses and classifies their types into benign or malignant. Our results show that the proposed YOLO-based CAD system detects the mass location with an overall accuracy of 96.33%. The system also distinguishes between benign and malignant lesions with an overall accuracy of 85.52%. Our proposed system seems to be feasible as a CAD system capable of detection and classification at the same time. It also overcomes some challenging breast cancer cases such as the mass existing in the pectoral muscles or dense regions.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037053","startPage":"1230","endPage":"1233","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037053.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and classification of the breast abnormalities in digital mammograms via regional Convolutional Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037053/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detection and classification of the breast abnormalities in digital mammograms via regional Convolutional Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8037053/","accessionNumber":"17175001","pubMedId":"29060098","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and classification of the breast abnormalities in digital mammograms via regional Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"03790489.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100564S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8037060,"authors":[{"name":"Vasileios Papapanagiotou","affiliation":["Multimedia Understanding Group, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Vasileios","lastName":"Papapanagiotou","id":"37085764318"},{"name":"Christos Diou","affiliation":["Multimedia Understanding Group, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Diou","id":"37417596400"},{"name":"Anastasios Delopoulos","affiliation":["Multimedia Understanding Group, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Anastasios","lastName":"Delopoulos","id":"37374768800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8037060","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chewing detection from an in-ear microphone using convolutional neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037060","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Microphones","Ear","Convolution","Neurons","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","microphones","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chewing detection","in-ear microphone","convolutional neural networks","feature-learning","1-dimensional convolutional neural networks","audio samples","semifree living dataset","SPLENDID project"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Feeding Behavior","Mastication","Neural Networks (Computer)","Sound"]}],"abstract":"Detecting chewing sounds from a microphone placed inside the outer ear for eating behaviour monitoring still remains a challenging task. This is mainly due the difficulty in discriminating non-chewing sounds (e.g. speech or sounds caused by walking) from chews, as well as due to to the high variability of the chewing sounds of different food types. Most approaches rely on detecting distictive structures on the sound wave, or on extracting a set of features and using a classifier to detect chews. In this work, we propose to use feature-learning in the time domain with 1-dimensional convolutional neural networks for for chewing detection. We apply a network of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers directly on windows of the audio samples to detect chewing activity, and then aggregate individual chews to eating events.

This model allows accurate computations of induced electric field in every tissue given different locations of a shape-eight coil, a biphasic pulse, common TMS pulse durations, and using different values of the TMS intensity measured in SMT (Standard Motor Threshold) units. Our simulation results estimate the maximum peak values of the electric field in the fetal area for every fetal tissue separately and for the TMS intensity of one SMT unit.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimates of peak electric fields induced by Transcranial magnetic stimulation in pregnant women as patients using an FEM full-body model","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037105","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037105.pdf","startPage":"1441","endPage":"1444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Estimates of peak electric fields induced by Transcranial magnetic stimulation in pregnant women as patients using an FEM full-body model","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8037105/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17189457","pubMedId":"29060149","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimates of peak electric fields induced by Transcranial magnetic stimulation in pregnant women as patients using an FEM full-body model","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"04371455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069763S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8037110,"authors":[{"name":"Stephanie L.

This paper builds upon a body of work examining in-hospital older adult patients at-risk of developing pedal pressure ulcers by examining thermal images of one patient, who was reporting pain in her right foot, over 112 days of a hospital stay. Thermal images of the patient's left and right heels and malleoli were subjected to image processing to remove noise and enhance contrast, region selection and feature extraction to observe changes in temperature over time. Mean intensity within each ROI was extracted, and the difference in temperature between the left and right heels was calculated over time. The resulting temperature pattern was consistent with the physical phenomenon related to ulcer development, intervention and recovery; the right heel was similar in temperature when starting the study and at the end of the study, but was drastically warmer when experiencing erythema and drastically colder when experiencing ischaemia. These results suggest that consistent thermal imaging, in conjunction with image processing may be able to detect the formation of pressure ulcers faster than can be visually observed. Early detection of pressure ulcers is critical in the prevention of pressure ulcers, and is of great importance to any hospital or nursing home.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037110","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017

continuous glucose monitoring time-series","abstract":"Over the past decade, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has proven to be a very resourceful tool for diabetes management. To date, CGM devices are employed for both retrospective and online applications. Their use allows to better describe the patients' pathology as well as to achieve a better control of patients' level of glycemia. The analysis of CGM sensor data makes possible to observe a wide range of metrics, such as the glycemic variability during the day or the amount of time spent below or above certain glycemic thresholds. However, due to the high variability of the glycemic signals among sensors and individuals, CGM data analysis is a non-trivial task. Standard signal filtering solutions fall short when an appropriate model personalization is not applied. State-of-the-art data-driven strategies for online CGM forecasting rely upon the use of recursive filters. Each time a new sample is collected, such models need to adjust their parameters in order to predict the next glycemic level. In this paper we aim at demonstrating that the problem of online CGM forecasting can be successfully tackled by personalized machine learning models, that do not need to recursively update their parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8037164/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17189598","pubMedId":"29060208","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven strategies for robust forecast of continuous glucose monitoring time-series","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven strategies for robust forecast of continuous glucose monitoring time-series","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"05840607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054064S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8037173,"authors":[{"name":"Huijing Xu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Huijing","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085594289"},{"name":"Ahuva Weltman","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Ahuva","lastName":"Weltman","id":"37085699191"},{"name":"Kee Scholten","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Kee","lastName":"Scholten","id":"37085697648"},{"name":"Ellis Meng","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Ellis","lastName":"Meng","id":"37298046200"},{"name":"Theodore W.

A 64-channel Parylene-based flexible electrode array was designed and fabricated. The layout of the electrode array was arranged to conform to the shape of cell body layers of the rat hippocampus. An insertion technique of temporarily reduce the effective length of the probe with polyethylene glycol (PEG) was developed and tested in vivo. The multi-electrode array was implanted into a rat hippocampus for chronic experimentation and unitary activities were collected both during the implantation and after recovery while the animal ran freely in an open field.

In order to achieve pixel-level accuracy meanwhile reduce computational time, potential exudate candidate points are first extracted with morphological ultimate opening algorithm. Then the local region (64 \u00d7 64) surrounding the candidate points are forwarded to the trained CNN model for classification/identification. A pixel-wise accuracy of 91.92%, sensitivity of 88.85% and specificity of 96% is achieved with the proposed CNN architecture on the test database.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037180","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037180.pdf","startPage":"1744","endPage":"1747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Exudate detection for diabetic retinopathy with convolutional neural networks","isConference":true,"pubMedId":"29060224","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17189818","htmlLink":"/document/8037180/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exudate detection for diabetic retinopathy with convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"06060537.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063329S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8037182,"authors":[{"name":"Shuo Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Molecular Imaging, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086050243"},{"name":"Mu Zhou","affiliation":["Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research (BMIR), Stanford University, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086052947"},{"name":"Olivier Gevaert","affiliation":["Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research (BMIR), Stanford University, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Gevaert","id":"37945720200"},{"name":"Zhenchao Tang","affiliation":["Electrical & Information Engineering, Shandong University, Weihai, Shandong Province, China"],"firstName":"Zhenchao","lastName":"Tang","id":"37086051524"},{"name":"Di Dong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Molecular Imaging, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Dong","id":"37529947800"},{"name":"Zhenyu Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Molecular Imaging, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086156678"},{"name":"Tian Jie","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Molecular Imaging, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Jie","id":"37088356309"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8037182","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1464},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037182","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Training","Lungs","Computed tomography","Shape","Testing","Level set"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","image segmentation","lung","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiview deep convolutional neural networks","lung nodule segmentation","MV-CNN","nodule-sensitive features","axial views","coronal views","sagittal views","network architecture","CNN branches","stacked layers","multiscale nodule patches","fully connected layer","patch center voxel","public LIDC-IDRI dataset","ground-truth annotations","CT imaging data","juxta-pleural nodules","cavitary nodules","nonsolid nodules","average dice similarity coefficient","DSC","average surface distance","ASD","conventional image segmentation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Humans","Lung Neoplasms","Neural Networks (Computer)","Tomography, X-Ray Computed"]}],"abstract":"We present a multi-view convolutional neural networks (MV-CNN) for lung nodule segmentation.

This study proposes real-time models for the detection of surgical instruments during laparoscopic surgery by using a CNN(Convolutional Neural Network). A dataset included information of the 7 surgical tools is used for learning CNN. To track surgical instruments in real time, unified architecture of YOLO apply to the models.

Along with the neural network, a newly proposed ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) processing technique called Two-stage Zero-order Holding (TZH) algorithm has also been presented in the paper. The proposed methodology has the advantages over traditional blood pressure estimation algorithms which are based on Pulse Transit time (PTT). The paper addresses the effectiveness of the algorithm by computing the Root-Mean-Squared Errors (RMSE) between the BP estimated and the ground truth. Our algorithm shows precise systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure estimation with the average RMSE values in 2.751 mmHg and 1.604 mmHg respectively across the sample used. Experimental results suggest that BP estimation based on LSTM has great potential to be embedded into monitoring system for better accuracy and generalization.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037207","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037207.pdf","startPage":"1853","endPage":"1856","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous systolic and diastolic blood pressure estimation utilizing long short-term memory network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Continuous systolic and diastolic blood pressure estimation utilizing long short-term memory network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17174926","pubMedId":"29060251","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8037207/","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous systolic and diastolic blood pressure estimation utilizing long short-term memory network","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"06421257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126072S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8037227,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihua Tang","affiliation":["Province-Ministry Joint Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Field and Electrical Apparatus Reliability, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Zhihua","lastName":"Tang","id":"37086195071"},{"name":"Yijun Wang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Semiconductors, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yijun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281451600"},{"name":"Guoya Dong","affiliation":["Province-Ministry Joint Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Field and Electrical Apparatus Reliability, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Guoya","lastName":"Dong","id":"37419280500"},{"name":"Weihua Pei","affiliation":["Province-Ministry Joint Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Field and Electrical Apparatus Reliability, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Weihua","lastName":"Pei","id":"38479742800"},{"name":"Hongda Chen","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Semiconductors, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongda","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281185600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8037227","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"abstract":"High-speed steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) has been demonstrated in several recent studies. This study aimed to investigate some issues regarding feasibility of learning to control an SSVEP-based BCI speller in na\u00efve subjects. An experiment with new BCI users was designed to answer the following questions: (1) How many people can use the SSVEP-BCI speller? (2) How much time is required to train the user? (3) Does continuous system use lead to user fatigue and deteriorated BCI performance? The experiment consisted of three tasks including a 40-class BCI spelling task, a psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) task, and a test of sleepiness scale. Subjects' reaction time (RT) in the PVT task and the fatigue rank in the sleepiness scale test were used as objective and subjective parameters to evaluate subjects' alertness level. Among 11 na\u00efve subjects, 10 of them fulfilled the 9-block experiment. Four of them showed clear learning effects (i.e., an increasing trend of classification accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR)) over time. The remaining subjects showed stable BCI performance during the whole experiment. The results of RT and fatigue rank showed a gradually increasing trend, which is not significant across blocks. In summary, the results of this study suggest that controlling an SSVEP-based BCI speller is in general feasible to learn by na\u00efve subjects after a short training procedure, showing no clear performance deterioration related to fatigue.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fatigue","Sleep","Indexes","Visualization","Market research","Training","Electrodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC:

convolution network based features for ultrasonic fatty liver tissue characterization","abstract":"Accumulation of excess fat in the liver tissue is the leading cause for dysfunction of liver, which can lead to the diseases from fibrosis to end stage cirrhosis. Hence, early detection of fatty liver becomes crucial in avoiding the liver from permanent failure. Depending on the concentration of fat in the tissue, the liver is classified as Normal, Grade 1, Grade 2 and Grade 3 respectively. The texture of liver tissue in ultrasound image is so specific to the concentration of fat, hence classifying the fatty liver is formulated as a texture discrimination problem. In this paper, we present an automated algorithm for grading the tissue of a fatty liver based on the features obtained from the invariant scattering convolution network (ISCN). ISCN, which involves cascade of modulus complex wavelet transforms and averaging operations results in scattering coefficients (SC), these coefficients will give stable invariant representations and also maps the texture of fatty liver image to a discriminative manifold giving good features for classification. SC are of high dimension and hence a compact representation feature is obtained by summing all the SC coefficients. Summed SC features along with cubic SVM classifier gave an accuracy of 96.6% in automatically categorizing the fatty content present in the tissue of a liver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037239/","accessionNumber":"17189773","pubMedId":"29060283","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8037239/","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deep scattering convolution network based features for ultrasonic fatty liver tissue characterization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep scattering convolution network based features for ultrasonic fatty liver tissue characterization","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"06941701.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055115S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8037243,"authors":[{"name":"Saddam Hussain","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, University of Engineering & Technology, Taxila, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Saddam","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37086052153"},{"name":"Syed Muhammad Anwar","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, University of Engineering & Technology, Taxila, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Syed Muhammad","lastName":"Anwar","id":"37604161600"},{"name":"Muhammad Majid","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Engineering & Technology, Taxila, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Majid","id":"37085639604"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8037243","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1181},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brain tumor segmentation using cascaded deep convolutional neural network","abstract":"Gliomas are the most common and threatening brain tumors with little to no survival rate. Accurate detection of such tumors is crucial for survival of the subject. Naturally, tumors have irregular shape and can be spatially located anywhere in the brain, which makes it a challenging task to segment them accurately enough for clinical purposes. In this paper, an automated segmentation algorithm for brain tumor using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) is proposed. Deep networks tend to have a lot of parameters thus over-fitting is almost always an issue especially when data are sparse. Max-out and drop-out layers are used to reduce the chances of over-fitting since data are scant. Patch based training method is used for the model where two types of patches sized 37\u00d737 and 19\u00d719 with same center pixel are selected. The proposed algorithm includes preprocessing in which images are normalized and bias field corrected, and post processing where small false positives are removed using morphological operators. BRATS 2013 dataset is used for evaluation of the proposed method, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods with similar settings in key performance indicators.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tumors","Magnetic resonance imaging","Image segmentation","Training","Convolution","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","brain","image segmentation","medical image processing","neural nets","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain tumor segmentation","cascaded deep convolutional neural network","threatening brain tumors","automated segmentation algorithm","brain tumor","DCNN","Max-out layers","drop-out layers","patch based training method","center pixel","image preprocessing","morphological operators","BRATS 2013 dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["brain tumor","segmentation","deep learning","convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Brain","Brain Neoplasms","Glioma","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037243","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037243","startPage":"1998","endPage":"2001","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037243.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037243/","displayDocTitle":"Brain tumor segmentation using cascaded deep convolutional neural network","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17189504","pubMedId":"29060287","htmlLink":"/document/8037243/","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brain tumor segmentation using cascaded deep convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"06980612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107601S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8037244,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Al Hajj","affiliation":["Inserm, UMR 1101, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Al Hajj","id":"37086195173"},{"name":"Mathieu Lamard","affiliation":["Inserm, UMR 1101, Brest, France","Univ Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Mathieu","lastName":"Lamard","id":"37547746800"},{"name":"Katia Charri\u00e8re","affiliation":["Inserm, UMR 1101, Brest, France","Dpt ITI, Institut Mines-Telecom;

Unlike existing solutions, the proposed CNN does not analyze images independently. it analyzes sequences of consecutive images. Features extracted from each image by the CNN are fused inside the network using the optical flow. For improved performance, this multi-image fusion strategy is also applied while training the CNN. The proposed framework was evaluated in a dataset of 30 cataract surgery videos (6 hours of videos). Ten tool categories were defined by surgeons.

While most of the signal and classification techniques for the detection of brain responses are based on linear algebra, different pattern recognition techniques such as convolutional neural network (CNN), as a type of deep learning technique, have shown some interests as they are able to process the signal after limited pre-processing. In this study, we propose to investigate the performance of CNNs in relation of their architecture and in relation to how they are evaluated: a single system for each subject, or a system for all the subjects. More particularly, we want to address the change of performance that can be observed between specifying a neural network to a subject, or by considering a neural network for a group of subjects, taking advantage of a larger number of trials from different subjects. The results support the conclusion that a convolutional neural network trained on different subjects can lead to an AUC above 0.9 by using an appropriate architecture using spatial filtering and shift invariant layers.","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037251.pdf","startPage":"2031","endPage":"2034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037251","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional neural networks for event-related potential detection: impact of the architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Convolutional neural networks for event-related potential detection: impact of the architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037251/","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8037251/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17189624","pubMedId":"29060295","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional neural networks for event-related potential detection: impact of the architecture","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"07091409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115396S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8037252,"authors":[{"name":"Zijing Mao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering"],"firstName":"Zijing","lastName":"Mao","id":"37086009048"},{"name":"Wan Xiang Yao","affiliation":["College of Education and Human Development Department, University of Texas at San Antonio, USA"],"firstName":"Wan Xiang","lastName":"Yao","id":"37086011832"},{"name":"Yufe Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering"],"firstName":"Yufe","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086007577"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8037252","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Brain modeling","Electroencephalography","Convolution","Correlation","Frequency modulation","Spatial filters","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deconvolution","electroencephalography","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","signal representation","spatial filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep convolutional networks","target prediction","time-locked image rapid serial visual presentation experiment","CNN models","convolution filters","spatial correlations","temporal correlations","EEG data","global spatial filter","deconvolution network","deep learning","EEG-based classifications","brain computer interaction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep learning","RSVP","convolution neural network","deconvolutional network","region of interest CNN"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Bayes Theorem","Brain","Machine Learning","Neural Networks (Computer)"]}],"abstract":"We report in this paper an investigation of convolutional neural network (CNN) models for target prediction in time-locked image rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) experiment. We investigated CNN models with 11 different designs of convolution filters in capturing spatial and temporal correlations in EEG data. We showed that for both within-subject and cross-subject predictions, the CNN models outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms: Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) and xDAWN spatial filtering and achieved >6% improvement. Among the 11 different CNN models, the global spatial filter and our proposed region of interest (ROI) achieved best performance. We also implemented the deconvolution network to show how we can visualize from activated hidden units for target/nontarget events learned by the ROI-CNN. Our study suggests that deep learning is a powerful tool for RSVP target prediction and the proposed model is applicable for general EEG-based classifications in brain computer interaction research.

We applied a feature selection method based on the mutual information called the variational information maximization, which has been reported as the state-of-the-art work among information based feature selection methods. The main difficulty in applying the method is estimating reliable probability density of input and output data, especially when the data are high dimensional and real-valued. We addressed this problem by applying a generative stochastic neural network called the restricted Boltzmann machine, through which we could perform sampling based probability estimation. The mutual informations between inputs and outputs are evaluated in each backward sensor elimination step, and the least informative sensor is removed with its network connections. The entire network is fine-tuned by maximizing conditional likelihood in each step. Experimental results are shown for 4 healthy subjects walking with various speeds, recording 64 sensor measurements including electromyogram, acceleration, and foot-pressure sensors attached on both lower limbs for predicting hip and knee joint angles. For test set of walking with arbitrary speed, our results show that our suggested method can select informative sensors while maintaining a good prediction accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037254","startPage":"2043","endPage":"2046","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037254.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Informative sensor selection and learning for prediction of lower limb kinematics using generative stochastic neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","Robot sensing systems","Legged locomotion","Estimation","Electromyography","Reliability","Kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","Boltzmann equation","electromyography","feature selection","kinematics","maximum likelihood estimation","medical signal processing","neural nets","pressure sensors","probability","signal sampling","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["informative sensor selection","learning","generative stochastic neural networks","input sensors","mathematical model","lower limb joint kinematics","variational information maximization","state-of-the-art work","information based feature selection methods","reliable probability density","high dimensional data","real-valued data","generative stochastic neural network","restricted Boltzmann machine","sampling based probability estimation","backward sensor elimination step","least informative sensor","maximizing conditional likelihood","sensor measurements","electromyogram","acceleration","foot-pressure sensors","arbitrary speed"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Acceleration","Biomechanical Phenomena","Humans","Lower Extremity","Neural Networks (Computer)","Walking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Informative sensor selection and learning for prediction of lower limb kinematics using generative stochastic neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8037254/","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17189575","pubMedId":"29060298","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Informative sensor selection and learning for prediction of lower limb kinematics using generative stochastic neural networks","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"07120943.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089922S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8037275,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Xu","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086096485"},{"name":"Jiehui Jiang","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jiehui","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086021526"},{"name":"Hucheng Zhou","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hucheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086096256"},{"name":"Zhuangzhi Yan","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhuangzhi","lastName":"Yan","id":"37333486700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8037275","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":660},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037275","abstract":"Blood Pressure (BP) measurement can assist doctors to assess patients' cardiovascular status and diagnose heart diseases.

However, individual variations may influence the measurement accuracy of PWTT model. Focusing on above promble, this paper proposes a novel BP estimation method combining a classical PWTT model and a neural network model. The novel method is composed of five steps: signal pre-processing, feature extraction, initial PWTT model selection, model correction by neural network model, and final PWTT model identification. A validation experiment based on 10 patients from Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC) database showed that the BP estimation results by our method had a minimum mean of error readout value 5 mmHg with a standard deviation of error readout value \u00b18mmHg. As a result, both the diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure estimation by our method can meet clinical requirements.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037275","startPage":"2130","endPage":"2133","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037275.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel Blood Pressure estimation method combing Pulse Wave Transit Time model and neural network model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Mathematical model","Estimation","Neural networks","Biomedical monitoring","Electrocardiography","Blood pressure"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood pressure measurement","cardiovascular system","diseases","electrocardiography","electroencephalography","feature extraction","medical signal processing","neural nets","patient monitoring","photoplethysmography","physiological models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood pressure estimation method","pulse wave transit time model","neural network model","blood pressure measurement","cardiovascular status","heart disease diagnosis","classical PWTT model","signal preprocessing","feature extraction","multiparameter-intelligent-monitoring-in-intensive-care","MIMIC database","error readout value","diastolic blood pressure","systolic blood pressure","electroencephalography","electrocardiography","photoplethysmography"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blood pressure","estimation","pulse wave transit time","neural network"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Blood Pressure","Blood Pressure Determination","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pulse Wave Analysis","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"A novel Blood Pressure estimation method combing Pulse Wave Transit Time model and neural network model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8037275/","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17174912","pubMedId":"29060318","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel Blood Pressure estimation method combing Pulse Wave Transit Time model and neural network model","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"07391281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069145S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8037283,"authors":[{"name":"Jackson W.

Since the high dimension of observation data, sparse feature learning plays an important role in overcoming the challenge of high variable dimension and low sample size problem among the disease identification. In this paper, sparse Elastic Net (EN) was used to extract low dimension features and to identify the Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compare with principal component analysis (PCA) method, the EN method can solve the problems of less samples and high correlations between variables. For those variables sharing the same biological phenomenon, it selected whole groups into the model automatically once one variable among them was selected. Unlike other subspace learning methods, the proposed method used less man-made feature setting. The problems of dimension reduction and classification were conducted into a similar formulation.

The method was evaluated by comparing with a traditional IIR notch filter and an adaptive filtering method.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037314","startPage":"2296","endPage":"2299","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037314.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elimination of power line interference from ECG signals using recurrent neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","IIR filters","Notch filters","Maximum likelihood detection","Recurrent neural networks","Nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","electrocardiography","feature extraction","medical signal processing","notch filters","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power line interference","recurrent neural networks","electrocardiogram signals","RNN-based model","PLI signal pattern","feature extraction","QRS complex distortion","ECG signal filtering","IIR notch filter","adaptive filtering method","frequency 50 Hz"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Electrocardiography","Neural Networks (Computer)","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Elimination of power line interference from ECG signals using recurrent neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8037314/","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17174942","pubMedId":"29060356","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elimination of power line interference from ECG signals using recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"07930161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078687S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8037323,"authors":[{"name":"Edward J.

This problem has been mitigated by using a novel methodology based on deep learning framework which automatically extracts the useful features and reduces the computational cost. As a proof of concept, we have attempted to design a generalized model for recognition of three fundamental movements of the human forearm performed in daily life where data is collected from four different subjects using a single wrist worn accelerometer sensor. The validation of the proposed model is done with different pre-processing and noisy data condition which is evaluated using three possible methods. The results show that our proposed methodology achieves an average recognition rate of 99.8% as opposed to conventional methods based on K-means clustering, linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17190024","pubMedId":"29060391","htmlLink":"/document/8037349/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"CNN based approach for activity recognition using a wrist-worn accelerometer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CNN based approach for activity recognition using a wrist-worn accelerometer","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"09520774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054305S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8037381,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-An Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Neurology, National DefenseMedical Center, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-An","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37855374000"},{"name":"Hung-Wen Chiu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Biomedical Informatics, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Wen","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37278332500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8037381","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diseases","Carotid arteries","Databases","Surgery","Prognostics and health management","Artificial neural networks","Heart"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood vessels","cardiovascular system","diseases","multilayer perceptrons","stents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network model","carotid artery stenting prognosis","national-wide database","ischemia stroke","neck carotid ultrasound","carotid artery stenosis detection","cerebrovascular stenosis treatment","multilayer perceptron"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Carotid Artery Diseases","Carotid Stenosis","Endarterectomy, Carotid","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Prognosis","Risk Factors","Stents","Stroke","Taiwan","Treatment Outcome"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037381","abstract":"Stroke is a serious health problem in many countries. About 20% of ischemia stroke involves carotid stenosis. Neck carotid ultrasound is fast, secure and convenient way to detect carotid artery stenosis. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has become a popular treatment for cerebrovascular stenosis in recent years. However, CAS may also induce the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in older patients. Hence the evaluation the CAS prognosis is important. In this study, we attempted to construct a model for the evaluation of CAS prognosis by artificial neural network (ANN). The data of 317 patients from Taiwan Nation Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) was used to train and test the constructed ANN model. The input features contain 13 clinical risk factors and the output is the occurrence of MACE. In results, an ANN model of multilayer perceptron with 18 neurons in hidden layer was developed. The performance of this model is with sensitivity 89.4%, specificity 57.4%, and accuracy 82.5% in testing group as well as with sensitivity 85.8%, specificity 60.8% and accuracy 80.76% in overall patients. The results revealed that the created ANN model achieved a good performance in prediction of MACE in patients needing CAS treatment. Such a model will be helpful for prevention of high-risked patients with CAS and could serve as a reference of communication when neurologists refer patients and before patients are treated by cardiologists.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037381","startPage":"2566","endPage":"2569","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology

This paper implements a new model for tele-ultrasound (US) based on volumetric sweep imaging protocols specially designed for the acquisition of US. Non-physician health personnel from the RA are trained on the use of these protocols in a few days. The operator utilizes the medical box (MB), a specially designed telecommunication system, to guide, compress, encrypt and transmit the US sweeps through the cloud to the radiologist who performs the diagnosis remotely. The report is automatically sent back to the MB. The system was able to send US volumetric images with poor connectivity conditions in 6 minutes on average. These results of implementing this tele-ultrasound model in RAs are encouraging and support future validations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","startPage":"2622","endPage":"2625","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037395.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New tele-diagnostic model using volume sweep imaging for rural areas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037395/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8037395/","displayDocTitle":"New tele-diagnostic model using volume sweep imaging for rural areas","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17174975","pubMedId":"29060437","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New tele-diagnostic model using volume sweep imaging for rural areas","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"10201692.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062049S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8037437,"authors":[{"name":"Dharmendra Gurve","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Dharmendra","lastName":"Gurve","id":"37085734696"},{"name":"Jeevan K.

Therefore, an Expected Activity Measurement (EAM) is calculated for each coefficient as a feature extraction method.

This entails carefully monitoring blood glucose levels and taking corrective steps whenever they are too high or too low. If blood glucose levels could be accurately predicted, patients could take proactive steps to prevent blood glucose excursions from occurring. However, accurate predictions require complex physiological models of blood glucose behavior. Factors such as insulin boluses, carbohydrate intake, and exercise influence blood glucose in ways that are difficult to capture through manually engineered equations. In this paper, we describe a recursive neural network (RNN) approach that uses long short-term memory (LSTM) units to learn a physiological model of blood glucose. When trained on raw data from real patients, the LSTM networks (LSTMs) obtain results that are competitive with a previous state-of-the-art model based on manually engineered physiological equations. The RNN approach can incorporate arbitrary physiological parameters without the need for sophisticated manual engineering, thus holding the promise of further improvements in prediction accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17189922","pubMedId":"29060501","htmlLink":"/document/8037460/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using LSTMs to learn physiological models of blood glucose behavior","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using LSTMs to learn physiological models of blood glucose behavior","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"11840838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078614S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8037461,"authors":[{"name":"Jisu Hong","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Institute for Basic Science, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jisu","lastName":"Hong","id":"37086155161"},{"name":"Bo-yong Park","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Institute for Basic Science, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Bo-yong","lastName":"Park","id":"37085889935"},{"name":"Hyunjin Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronic, Institute for Basic Science, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunjin","lastName":"Park","id":"37085897976"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8037461","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":552},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional neural network classifier for distinguishing Barrett's esophagus and neoplasia endomicroscopy images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037461","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Imaging","Esophagus","Training","Classification algorithms","Distortion","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological organs","biomedical optical imaging","diseases","endoscopes","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural network classifier","Barrett esophagus endomicroscopy images","neoplasia endomicroscopy images","cells","intestinal metaplasia","gastric metaplasia","esophageal cancer","deep learning algorithm","CNN architecture","endomicroscopy imaging data","International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging","image distortion","image classification accuracy"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Barrett Esophagus","Esophageal Diseases","Esophageal Neoplasms","Humans","Metaplasia","Neural Networks (Computer)"]}],"abstract":"Barrett's esophagus is a diseased condition with abnormal changes of the cells in the esophagus. Intestinal metaplasia (IM) and gastric metaplasia (GM) are two sub-classes of Barrett's esophagus. As IM can progress to the esophageal cancer, the neoplasia (NPL), developing methods for classifying between IM and GM are important issues in clinical practice. We adopted a deep learning (DL) algorithm to classify three conditions of IM, GM, and NPL based on endimicroscopy images. We constructed a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to distinguish among three classes. A total of 262 endomicroscopy imaging data of Barrett's esophagus were obtained from the international symposium on biomedical imaging (ISBI) 2016 challenge. 155 IM, 26 GM and 55 NPL cases were used to train the architecture. We implemented image distortion to augment the sample size of the training data. We tested our proposed architecture using the 26 test images that include 17 IM, 4 GM and 5 NPL cases.

robust beamforming approach for early detection of readiness potential with application to brain-computer interface systems","abstract":"Early detection of intention to move, at self-paced voluntary movements from the activities of neural current sources on the motor cortex, can be an effective approach to brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Achieving high sensitivity and pre-movement negative latency are important issues for increasing the speed of BCI and other rehabilitation and neurofeedback systems used by disabled and stroke patients and helps enhance their movement abilities. Therefore, developing high-performance extractors or beamformers is a necessary task in this regard. In this paper, for the sake of improving the beamforming performance in well reconstruction of sources of readiness potential, related to hand movement, one kind of surface spatial filter (spherical spline derivative on electrode space) and the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer are utilized jointly. Moreover, in order to achieve better results, the real head model of each subject was created, using individual head MRI, and was used in beamformer algorithm. Also, few optimizations were done on reconstructed source signal powers to help our template matching classifier with detection of movement onset for five healthy subjects. Our classification results show an average true positive rate (TPR) of 77.1% and 73.1%, false positive rate (FPR) of 28.96% and 28.74% and latency of -512.426 \u00b1396. 7ms and - 360.29 \u00b1252. 16 ms from signals of current sources of motor cortex and sensor space respectively. It can be seen that the proposed method has reliable sensitivity and is faster in prediction of movement onset and more reliable to be used for online BCI in future.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037483/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17189452","pubMedId":"29060524","publicationDate":"July 2017","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8037483/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A robust beamforming approach for early detection of readiness potential with application to brain-computer interface systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust beamforming approach for early detection of readiness potential with application to brain-computer interface systems","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"12070106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107591S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8037486,"authors":[{"name":"Bonghun Shin","affiliation":["Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering of University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Bonghun","lastName":"Shin","id":"37086082457"},{"name":"Soo Jeon","affiliation":["Advanced Medical Technology Lab of Healcerion, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Soo","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37086078974"},{"name":"Jeongwon Ryu","affiliation":["Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering of University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Jeongwon","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37088108026"},{"name":"Hyock Ju Kwon","affiliation":["Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering of University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Hyock Ju","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37086085467"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8037486","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Strain","Elastography","Image reconstruction","Phantoms","Radio frequency","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","biomedical ultrasonics","compressed sensing","discrete cosine transforms","Fourier transforms","image reconstruction","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","portable ultrasound elastography","ultrasound radiofrequency data","CS frameworks","Fourier transform","discrete cosine transform","wave atom","reconstruction algorithms","\u21131 minimization","block sparse Bayesian learning","B-mode images","elastograms","RF data","CS reconstruction","BSBL algorithm","DCT model basis","maximum data reduction"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Bayes Theorem","Data Compression","Elasticity Imaging Techniques","Ultrasonography"]}],"abstract":"Feasibility of applying compressive sensing (CS) to ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) data to produce elastography is investigated.

GIF is a subtype of Freezing of Gait (FOG) and often leads to falls and related injuries. Understanding of neurobiological mechanisms underlying GIF has been limited by difficulties in eliciting and objectively characterizing such gait phenomena in the clinical setting. Studies investigating the effects of GIF on brain activity using EEG offer the potential to study such behavior. In this preliminary study, we present a novel methodology where wavelet transform was used for feature extraction and Support Vector Machine for classifying GIF events in five patients with PD and FOG. To deal with the large amount of EEG data, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the data dimension from 15 EEG channels into 6 principal components (PCs), retaining 93% of the information. Independent Component Analysis using Entropy Bound Minimization (ICA-EBM) was applied to 6 PCs for source separation with the aim of improving detection ability of GIF events as compared to the normal initiation of gait (Good Starts). The results of this analysis demonstrated the correct identification of GIF episodes with an 83.1% sensitivity, 89.5% specificity and 86.3% accuracy. These results suggest that our proposed methodology is a promising non-invasive approach to improve GIF detection in PD and FOG.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference

accurately predict the occurrence of a variety of diseases, which can contribute to precise medical interventions. While there is a growing interest in the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to address clinical problems, the use of deep-learning in healthcare have just gained attention recently. Deep learning, such as deep neural network (DNN), has achieved impressive results in the areas of speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing in recent years. However, deep learning is often difficult to comprehend due to the complexities in its framework. Furthermore, this method has not yet been demonstrated to achieve a better performance comparing to other conventional ML algorithms in disease prediction tasks using EMCs. In this study, we utilize a large population-based EMC database of around 800,000 patients to compare DNN with three other ML approaches for predicting 5-year stroke occurrence. The result shows that DNN and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) can result in similarly high prediction accuracies that are better compared to logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM) approaches. Meanwhile, DNN achieves optimal results by using lesser amounts of patient data when comparing to GBDT method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037515/","accessionNumber":"17190015","pubMedId":"29060556","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8037515/","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparing deep neural network and other machine learning algorithms for stroke prediction in a large-scale population-based electronic medical claims database","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing deep neural network and other machine learning algorithms for stroke prediction in a large-scale population-based electronic medical claims database","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"12540355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049374S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8037521,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Castiglioni","affiliation":["IRCCS Fondazione Don C.

In order to take into account the multiscale nature of cardiovascular regulation, it was proposed to evaluate entropy with a multiscale approach, based on the estimation of Sample Entropy on progressively coarse-grained series (Multiscale Sample Entropy, MSE). Aim of this work is to investigate two methodological aspects related to MSE of cardiovascular signals. The first aspect regards the tolerance below which a couple of points are considered similar in a given embedding dimension, in particular how the way the tolerance is set at each level of coarse graining influences the MSE estimates. The second aspect regards whether heart rate and blood pressure (BP) signals are characterized by different MSE structures.To investigate these aspects, we analyzed 65 continuous BP recordings of more than 90-minute duration in healthy volunteers sitting at rest, and applied MSE estimators to beat-by-beat series of systolic BP, diastolic BP and pulse interval (inverse of heart rate). Results indicate that the way the tolerance is set during coarse graining influences substantially the MSE profile of cardiovascular signals, modifying the relative level of their unpredictability.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037521","startPage":"3134","endPage":"3137","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037521.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale sample entropy of heart rate and blood pressure: Methodological aspects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale sample entropy of heart rate and blood pressure: Methodological aspects","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8037521/","accessionNumber":"17189480","pubMedId":"29060562","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037521/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale sample entropy of heart rate and blood pressure: Methodological aspects","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"12600380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049502S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8037525,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuyan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhuyan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086197760"},{"name":"Hongqing Zhu","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hongqing","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37418800100"},{"name":"Xuan Tao","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Tao","id":"37086052299"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8037525","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Image recognition","Feature extraction","Density functional theory","Probability","Gaussian mixture model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation-maximisation algorithm","feature extraction","Gaussian processes","image recognition","matrix decomposition","medical image processing","mixture models","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["missing-feature based Gaussian mixture model","graph constrained nonnegative matrix factorization","medical image recognition","high-dimensional feature vectors","feature extraction","alternating expectation conditional maximization","conditional mean imputation","object identification"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Bayes Theorem","Normal Distribution"]}],"abstract":"The demand for automatically recognizing medical images for screening, reference and management is growing faster than ever. Missing data phenomenon in medical image applications is common existence, and it could be inevitable. In this paper, we have addressed the problem of recognizing medical images with missing-features via Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based approach. Since training a GMM by directly using high-dimensional feature vectors will result in instability, we have proposed a novel strategy to train the GMM from the corresponding reduced-dimensional one. The proposed method contains training and test phases. The former contains feature extraction, graph constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), GMM training, and the alternating expectation conditional maximization (AECM) for extending the reduced-dimensional GMM. In test phase, two methods, marginalizing GMM using Bayesian decision (MGBD) and conditional mean imputation (CMI), are applied to impute missing-features. Posterior probability of test images is calculated to identify objects. Experimental results on three real datasets demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037525","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037525.pdf","startPage":"3150","endPage":"3153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image recognition with missing-features based on gaussian mixture model and graph constrained nonnegative matrix factorization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037525/","displayDocTitle":"Image recognition with missing-features based on gaussian mixture model and graph constrained nonnegative matrix factorization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17189813","pubMedId":"29060566","htmlLink":"/document/8037525/","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image recognition with missing-features based on gaussian mixture model and graph constrained nonnegative matrix factorization","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"12640177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053321S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8037550,"authors":[{"name":"Aiqi Sun","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Aiqi","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086196118"},{"name":"Bo Zhao","affiliation":["Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37404435100"},{"name":"Rui Li","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Li","id":"37086184452"},{"name":"Chun Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, University of Washington"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37289485000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8037550","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real-time systems","Magnetic resonance imaging","Spatial resolution","Image reconstruction","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","compressed sensing","haemodynamics","image coding","image resolution","medical disorders","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4D real-time phase-contrast flow MRI","sparse sampling","model-based imaging method","low-rank modeling","parallel imaging","4D real-time PC MRI","isotropic spatial resolution","temporal resolution","three-directional flow encodings","beat-by-beat flow variations","in vivo experiments","arrhythmic patient","blood flow"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Phase-contrast MRI","cardiovascular MRI","real-time imaging","low-rank model","subspace model","parallel imaging"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Microscopy, Phase-Contrast"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037550","abstract":"Conventional phase-contrast (PC) MRI relies on electrocardiogram (ECG)-synchronized cine acquisition and respiration control. It often results in relatively low data acquisition efficiency, and is unable to assess blood flow variabilities. Real-time imaging is a promising technique to overcome these limitations; however, it results in a challenging image reconstruction problem with highly-undersampled (k; t)-space data. This paper presents a novel model-based imaging method, which integrates low-rank modeling with parallel imaging, to enable 4D real-time PC MRI without ECG gating and respiration control. The proposed method achieves an isotropic spatial resolution of 2.4 mm and temporal resolution of 35.2 ms, with three directional flow encodings. Moreover, it is able to resolve beat-by-beat flow variations, which cannot be achieved by the conventional cine-based approach. The proposed method was evaluated with in vivo experiments with one healthy subject and one arrhythmic patient.

Miss-detected polyps in colonoscopy are potential risk factor for colorectal cancer. In this study, we investigate an automatic polyp classification framework. We aim to compare two different approaches named hand-craft feature method and convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning method. Combined shape and color features are used for hand craft feature extraction and support vector machine (SVM) method is adopted for classification. For CNN approach, three convolution and pooling based deep learning framework is used for classification purpose. The proposed framework is evaluated using three public polyp databases. From the experimental results, we have shown that the CNN based deep learning framework shows better classification performance than the hand-craft feature based methods. It achieves over 90% of classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17189712","pubMedId":"29060597","htmlLink":"/document/8037556/","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of hand-craft feature based SVM and CNN based deep learning framework for automatic polyp classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of hand-craft feature based SVM and CNN based deep learning framework for automatic polyp classification","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"12980642.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060724S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8037577,"authors":[{"name":"Praotasna Sombune","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering., Thammasat University, Thailand"],"firstName":"Praotasna","lastName":"Sombune","id":"37085882384"},{"name":"Phongphan Phienphanich","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering., Thammasat University, Thailand"],"firstName":"Phongphan","lastName":"Phienphanich","id":"37085516968"},{"name":"Sutanya Phuechpanpaisal","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering., Thammasat University, Thailand"],"firstName":"Sutanya","lastName":"Phuechpanpaisal","id":"37086018959"},{"name":"Sombat Muengtaweepongsa","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering., Thammasat University, Thailand"],"firstName":"Sombat","lastName":"Muengtaweepongsa","id":"37704552400"},{"name":"Anuchit Ruamthanthong","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering., Thammasat University, Thailand"],"firstName":"Anuchit","lastName":"Ruamthanthong","id":"37085875713"},{"name":"Charturong Tantibundhit","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering., Thammasat University, Thailand"],"firstName":"Charturong","lastName":"Tantibundhit","id":"37550930100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8037577","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Feature extraction","Spectrogram","Sensitivity","Training data","Real-time systems","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","brain","Doppler measurement","medical disorders","medical signal detection","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated embolic signal detection","Deep Convolutional Neural Network","cerebral embolic signal","transcranial Doppler ultrasound","TCD devices","stroke","Adaptive Gain Control approach","AGC approach","CNN-based system"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artifacts","Embolism","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037577","abstract":"This work investigated the potential of Deep Neural Network in detection of cerebral embolic signal (ES) from transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD).

The Adaptive Gain Control (AGC) approach developed in our previous study is employed to capture suspected ESs in real-time. By using spectrograms of the same TCD signal dataset as that of our previous work as inputs and the same experimental setup, Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which can learn features while training, was investigated for its ability to bypass the traditional handcrafted feature extraction and selection process. Extracted feature vectors from the suspected ESs are later determined whether they are of an ES, artifact (AF) or normal (NR) interval. The effectiveness of the developed system was evaluated over 19 subjects going under procedures generating emboli. The CNN-based system could achieve in average of 83.0% sensitivity, 80.1% specificity, and 81.4% accuracy, with considerably much less time consumption in development. The certainly growing set of training samples and computational resources will contribute to high performance.

To assess LID and adjust drug regimens for optimal relief, patients attend regular clinic visits. However, the intermittent nature of these visits can fail to capture important changes in a person's condition. With the recent emergence of deep learning achieving impressive results in a wide array of fields including computer vision, there is an opportunity for video analysis to be used for automated assessment of LID. Deep learning for pose estimation was studied as a viable means of extracting body movements from PD assessment videos. Movement features were computed from joint trajectories. Results show that features derived from vision-based analysis have moderate to good correlation with clinician ratings of dyskinesia severity. This study presents the first application of deep learning to video analysis in PD, and demonstrates promise for future development of a non-contact system for objective PD assessment.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Trajectory","Correlation","Machine learning","Neck","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","diseases","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","patient treatment","video signal processing","vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated vision-based analysis","levodopa-induced dyskinesia","deep learning","gold standard therapy","Parkinson's disease","additional motor complications","drug regimens","optimal relief","computer vision","video analysis"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Antiparkinson Agents","Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced","Humans","Levodopa","Machine Learning","Parkinson Disease"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037580","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037580.pdf","startPage":"3377","endPage":"3380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated vision-based analysis of levodopa-induced dyskinesia with deep learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automated vision-based analysis of levodopa-induced dyskinesia with deep learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037580/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8037580/","accessionNumber":"17189788","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","pubMedId":"29060621","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated vision-based analysis of levodopa-induced dyskinesia with deep learning","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"13321150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092745S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8037598,"authors":[{"name":"Ingo Walterscheid","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques FHR, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Ingo","lastName":"Walterscheid","id":"37266691900"},{"name":"Graeme E.

We present new signal processing and machine learning algorithms that learn and extract maximally different ECG features for different individuals and minimally different ECG features for the same individual over time. Experimental results with a large 741-subject in-house ECG database show that the distributions of the intra-subject (same person) Hamming distance of extracted ECG features and the inter-subject

for achieving 3D focusing, of micro-scale objects, in microfluidic devices. The microfluidic device employs four planar electrodes; two electrodes each on the top and bottom surface of the microchannel and each slightly protrude into the microchannel. Each electrode establishes electric field with the neighboring electrode on the same and opposite surfaces. The dielectrophoretic force pushes the micro-scale objects both the directions transverse to the flow direction to achieve the desired 3D focusing. The developed model accounts for various forces such as that associated with inertia, sedimentation, drag, and dielectrophoresis. Finite difference method is used for calculating the electric field and dielectrophoretic force as well as the displacements of micro-scale objects in the microchannel. Several geometric and operating parameters influence the trajectory of micro-scale objects. There exists a threshold voltage beyond which there is no increase in levitation height.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037633","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037633.pdf","startPage":"3588","endPage":"3591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of dielectrophoresis based 3D-focusing in microfluidic devices with planar electrodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037633/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of dielectrophoresis based 3D-focusing in microfluidic devices with planar electrodes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17189647","pubMedId":"29060674","htmlLink":"/document/8037633/","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of dielectrophoresis based 3D-focusing in microfluidic devices with planar electrodes","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"13991764.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063998S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8037686,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas Cummins","affiliation":["Chair of Complex & Intelligent Systems, Univeristy of Passau, Passau, Germany"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Cummins","id":"37077421000"},{"name":"Maximilian Schmitt","affiliation":["Chair of Complex & Intelligent Systems, Univeristy of Passau, Passau, Germany"],"firstName":"Maximilian","lastName":"Schmitt","id":"37086107061"},{"name":"Shahin Amiriparian","affiliation":["Universitat Passau, Passau, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Shahin","lastName":"Amiriparian"},{"name":"Jarek Krajewski","affiliation":["Human Factors and Diagnostics, University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany","Engineering Psychology, Rheinische Fachhochschule Cologne, Cologne, Germany"],"firstName":"Jarek","lastName":"Krajewski","id":"38191799300"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Schuller","affiliation":["Machine Learning Group, Imperial College London, U.K.","Chair of Complex & Intelligent Systems, Univeristy of Passau, Passau, Germany"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Schuller","id":"37283946000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8037686","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Support vector machines","Speech recognition","Acoustics","Standards","Quantization (signal)","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","health care","medical diagnostic computing","medical disorders","paediatrics","patient monitoring","speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic recognition","upper respiratory tract infection","passive smart monitoring technologies","noninvasive smart monitoring technologies","nonintrusive smart monitoring technologies","transforming healthcare","immediate health related feedback","serious public health concerns","seasonal cold","flu","diagnosis","social isolation","automated classification","recorded speech samples","classifiers","health-based detection tasks","computational paralinguistic analysis","URTI related illnesses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","Classification","Paralinguistic Analysis","Bag-of-Audio-Words","Feature Selection"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Humans","Respiratory Tract Infections","Sound","Speech"]}],"abstract":"A combination of passive, non-invasive and nonintrusive smart monitoring technologies is currently transforming healthcare.

The identification of DNA-binding sites and the specificity of target proteins in binding to these regions are two important steps in understanding the mechanisms of these biological activities. A number of high-throughput technologies have recently emerged that try to quantify the affinity between proteins and DNA motifs. Despite their success, these technologies have their own limitations and fall short in precise characterization of motifs, and as a result, require further downstream analysis to extract useful and interpretable information from a haystack of noisy and inaccurate data. Here we propose MotifMark, a new algorithm based on graph theory and machine learning, that can find binding sites on candidate probes and rank their specificity in regard to the underlying transcription factor. We developed a pipeline to analyze experimental data derived from compact universal protein binding microarrays and benchmarked it against two of the most accurate motif search methods. Our results indicate that MotifMark can be a viable alternative technique for prediction of motif from protein binding microarrays and possibly other related high-throughput techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MotifMark: Finding regulatory motifs in DNA sequences","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037706","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037706.pdf","startPage":"3890","endPage":"3893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"MotifMark: Finding regulatory motifs in DNA sequences","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8037706/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17189865","pubMedId":"29060747","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MotifMark: Finding regulatory motifs in DNA sequences","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"19311006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044953S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8037711,"authors":[{"name":"Guohui Wei","affiliation":["Sino-Dutch Biomedical and Information Engineering School, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Guohui","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085996257"},{"name":"He Ma","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Medical Image Computing"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085994400"},{"name":"Wei Qian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, El Paso, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Qian","id":"37085993105"},{"name":"Hongyang Jiang","affiliation":["Sino-Dutch Biomedical and Information Engineering School, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Hongyang","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086020352"},{"name":"Xinzhuo Zhao","affiliation":["Sino-Dutch Biomedical and Information Engineering School, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xinzhuo","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085995569"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2809-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2810-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"8037711","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lungs","Measurement","Cancer","Semantics","Feature extraction","Computed tomography","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","feature extraction","image classification","image texture","learning (artificial intelligence)","lung","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lung nodule diagnosis","learned distance metric","similarity metric","benign lung nodule lesions","malignant lung nodule lesions","computed tomography","features extraction","LIDC-IDRI lung CT images","texture features","content-based image retrieval scheme","learned Mahalanobis distance metric","semantic relevance","area-under-the-ROC-curve"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Area Under Curve","Humans","Lung","Lung Neoplasms","Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Solitary Pulmonary Nodule","Tomography, X-Ray Computed"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037711","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037711.pdf","startPage":"3910","endPage":"3913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Content-based retrieval for lung nodule diagnosis using learned distance metric","abstract":"Similarity metric of the lung nodules can be useful in differentiating between benign and malignant lung nodule lesions on computed tomography (CT). Unlike previous computerized schemes, which focus on the features extracting, we concentrate on similarity metric of the lung nodules. In this study, we first assemble a lung nodule dataset which is from LIDC-IDRI lung CT images. This dataset includes 746 lung nodules in which 375 domain radiologists identified malignant nodules and 371 domain radiologists-identified benign nodules. Each nodule is represented by a vector of 26 texture features. We then propose a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) scheme to classify between benign and malignant lung nodules with a learned Mahalanobis distance metric. The Mahalanobis distance metric as a similarity metric can preserve semantic relevance and visual similarity of lung nodules. The CBIR approach uses this Mahalanobis distance to search for most similar reference nodules for each queried nodule. The majority of votes are then computed to predict the likelihood of the queried nodule depicting a malignant lesion. For the classification accuracy, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) can achieve as 0.942\u00b10.008. The recall and precision of benign nodules are 0.860 and 0.889, respectively.

The stain decomposition on histopathological images is usually recommended to address the issue of co-localization or aliasing of tissue substances. Although the convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a popular deep learning algorithm for various tasks on histopathological image analysis, it is only directly performed on histopathological images without considering stain decomposition. The bilinear CNN (BCNN) is a new CNN model for fine-grained classification. BCNN consists of two CNNs, whose convolutional-layer outputs are multiplied with outer product at each spatial location. In this work, we propose a novel BCNN-based method for classification of histopathological images, which first decomposes histopathological images into hematoxylin and eosin stain components, and then perform BCNN on the decomposed images to fuse and improve the feature representation performance. The experimental results on the colorectal cancer histopathological image dataset with eight classes indicate that the proposed BCNN-based algorithm is superior to the traditional CNN.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Histopathological image classification with bilinear convolutional neural

To facilitate the CNN learning, we explore the structure of abundance profiles by creating the phylogenetic tree and by designing a scheme to embed the tree to a matrix that retains the spatial relationship of nodes in the tree and their quantitative characteristics. The proposed CNN framework is highly accurate, achieving a 99.47% of accuracy based on the evaluation on a dataset 1967 samples of three phenotypes.

It is a tiny small malignant mole that is usually black or brown but also appears in other color patterns. Early detection of melanoma is key as this is the time period when it is most likely to be cured. Due to the advancement of smartphone technology, automatic and efficient detection of melanoma mole using a smartphone is an active area of research. In this study, we developed an automatic melanoma diagnosis system using images captured from the digital camera. Our work differs from other studies in the area of segmentation of melanoma region and consideration of non-linear features for classification of malignant and benign melanoma. In this paper, a combination of Otsu and k-means clustering segmentation methods are applied to automatically segment and extract the borders of affected region with satisfactory accuracy. Also, we explored and extracted different non-linear features along with color and texture features existed in literature from the lesion mole. The effectiveness of these features was predicted with a machine learning model consisting of five different classifiers. Our model predicted the diagnosis of mole with an accuracy of 89.7%, i.e., around 10% more than reported results by others (to the best of our knowledge) with the same database.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic diagnosis of melanoma using linear and nonlinear features from digital image","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037802","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037802.pdf","startPage":"4281","endPage":"4284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Automatic diagnosis of melanoma using linear and nonlinear features from digital image","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8037802/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17189975","pubMedId":"29060843","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic diagnosis of melanoma using linear and nonlinear features from digital image","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"20320821.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076611S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8037827,"authors":[{"name":"Kha Vo","affiliation":["Global Big Data Technologies Centre, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Kha","lastName":"Vo","id":"37086024429"},{"name":"Diep N.

This paper aims to propose a real-time signal processing method to decrease the spelling time by exploiting the score margins of the ensemble Support Vector Machine classifiers during real-time P300-Speller flashes, rather than just getting the classifiers' highest scores. Our experiments were conducted on the dataset of the BCI Competition III and resulted in a successful character rate of over 96% with just approximately 15 to 20 seconds for each character spelling session. As compared with the fixed 31.5 seconds of the best original approach of the competition, our proposed method significantly reduces the required spelling time by over 30% while maintaining the desired classification accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037827","publicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8026122/8036736/08037827.pdf","startPage":"4383","endPage":"4386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time analysis on ensemble SVM scores to reduce P300-Speller intensification time","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Real-time analysis on ensemble SVM scores to reduce P300-Speller intensification time","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037827/","publicationDate":"July 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17189885","pubMedId":"29060868","htmlLink":"/document/8037827/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time analysis on ensemble SVM scores to reduce P300-Speller intensification time","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"20570460.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108083S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8026122","isNumber":"8036736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026122","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8036736","articleId":"8037827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8037964,"authors":[{"name":"Refik Caglar Kizilirmak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8037964/kizil-2752208-small.gif","p":["Refik Caglar Kizilirmak (M\u201912) was born in Izmir, Turkey, in 1981.

In a conventional VLC network, each light fixture acts as an access point (AP) which are connected to each other through electrical grid as well as data backbone. These VLC-enabled fixtures consist baseband unit (BBU) followed by the optical front-end (OFE). In this paper, we propose the so-called centralized light access network (C-LiAN) which aggregates all AP computational resources into a central pool that is managed by a centralized controller. Unlike the distributed architecture where each light fixture performs both baseband processing and optical transmission/reception, the centralized architecture employs \u201cdummy\u201dfixtures with a VLC OFE. Moving the baseband processing to a central pool reduces the associated cost and complexity of each VLC-enabled LED luminary. It further enables joint processing of signals from different APs making possible an efficient implementation of joint processing, offloading, handover, interference management, scheduling, and resource management algorithms. As an example to demonstrate the virtues of C-LiAN, we further present the performance of coordinated multipoint transmission and enhanced inter-cell interference coordination with almost blank subframe techniques originally proposed for Long Term Evolution-Advanced in the context of indoor VLC networks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Interference","Wireless communication","Baseband","Optical network units","Light emitting diodes","Lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","free-space optical communication","indoor radio","light emitting diodes","mobility management (mobile radio)","multiuser channels","next generation networks","optical communication","optical transmitters","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light fixture","baseband processing","centralized architecture","centralized light access network","next generation indoor VLC networks","optical transmission-reception","centralized controller","access point","conventional VLC network","wireless data transmission","existing lighting infrastructure","visible light communication","C-LiAN","joint processing","central pool","VLC OFE","dummyfixtures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Centralized light access networks","visible light communication","interference management"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2752208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08037964.pdf","startPage":"19703","endPage":"19710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2752208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Centralized Light Access Network (C-LiAN): A Novel Paradigm for Next Generation Indoor VLC Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037964","topic":"Optical Wireless Technologies for 5G Communications and Beyond","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Centralized Light Access Network (C-LiAN): A Novel Paradigm for Next Generation Indoor VLC Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037964/","volume":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/8037964/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17266495","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Turkish Scientific and Research Council","grantNumber":"215E311"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Centralized Light Access Network (C-LiAN): A Novel Paradigm for Next Generation Indoor VLC Networks","sourcePdf":"access-kizilirmak-2752208-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054644S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Optical Wireless Technologies for 5G Communications and Beyond"],"articleId":"8037964","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8037967,"authors":[{"name":"Irfan Khan","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8037967/khan-2752178-small.gif","p":["Irfan Khan (S\u2019 16) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan, in 2009, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical power engineering from the University of Greenwich, London, U.K., in 2011.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering with Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

Real-time control of power system now needs a massive amount of information to be transmitted between each local device and the central controller. The transmission of a huge quantity of information data poses great challenge to the communication network. To deal with this issue in reactive power control, this paper proposes a novel real-time compressive sensing-based optimal reactive power control of a multi-area interconnected power system. The objective is to minimize the power loss, voltage deviation, and reactive power generation cost simultaneously. According to the proposed scheme, the measured data in each control area is compressed before being transmitted through the communication network, and then recovered accurately by the discrete central controller. Orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is adopted to recover the compressed data, owing to its fast convergence speed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed compressive sensing-based approach by significantly reducing the data size of the transmitted data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

as data center interconnections, which utilize small, cheap, and low-bandwidth components, are sensitive to nonlinearities that are mainly produced by devices responsible for electrical signal amplification, modulation, and demodulation. One of the most promising schemes for these applications is the four-level pulse amplitude modulation format combined with intensity modulation and direct detection; however, it can be significantly degraded by linear and nonlinear intersymbol interference. Linear and nonlinear signal degradation can efficiently be handled by different types of equalizers. In many cases, the straightforward linear equalizer cannot lower the error rate at the acceptable level. Therefore, much stronger equalizers based on nonlinear models such as the Volterra series are proposed.

VEN is a vehicular network which can transport energy over a large geographical area by means of electric vehicles (EVs). In the near future, an abundance of EVs, plentiful generation of renewables, and mature wireless energy transfer and vehicular communication technologies will expedite the realization of VEN. To transmit energy from a source to a destination, we need to establish energy paths, which are composed of segments of vehicular routes, while satisfying various design objectives. In this paper, we develop a method to construct all energy paths for a particular energy source-destination pair, followed by some analytical results of the method. We describe how to utilize the energy paths to develop optimization models for different design goals and propose two solutions. We also develop a heuristic for the power loss minimization problem. We compare the performance of the three solution methods with artificial and real-world traffic networks and provide a comprehensive comparison in terms of solution quality, computation time, solvable problem size, and applicability. This paper lays the foundations of VEN routing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Routing for Vehicular Energy Network","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2752222","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8334665/08037971.pdf","startPage":"533","endPage":"545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2752222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8334665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8037971","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037971/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Routing for Vehicular Energy Network","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8037971/","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17685531","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Theme-Based Research Scheme of the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"T23-701/14-N"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Routing for Vehicular Energy Network","sourcePdf":"jiot-lam-2752222-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.182329S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8334665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8334665","articleId":"8037971","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8037973,"authors":[{"name":"Youngmin Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin-si, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8037973/jeong-2752177-small.gif","p":["Youngmin Jeong (S\u201909\u2013M\u201915) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in electronics and radio engineering from Kyung Hee University, Yongin-si, South Korea, in 2009, 2011, and 2015, respectively.

For the back-to-back setup, various shaped quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) distributions are found to have the same implementation penalty as uniform input. By demonstrating in transmission experiments that shaped QAM input leads to lower effective SNR than uniform input at a fixed average launch power, we experimentally confirm that shaping enhances the fiber nonlinearities. However, shaping is ultimately found to increase the AIR, which is the most relevant figure of merit, as it is directly related to spectral efficiency. In a detailed study of these shaping gains for the nonlinear fiber channel, four strategies for optimizing QAM input distributions are evaluated and experimentally compared in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems. The first shaping scheme generates a Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) distribution based on a linear additive white Gaussian noise channel. The second strategy uses the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm to optimize an unconstrained QAM distribution for a split-step Fourier method based channel model. In the third and fourth approach, MB-shaped QAM and unconstrained QAM are optimized via the enhanced Gaussian noise (EGN) model. Although the absolute shaping gains are found to be relatively small, the relative improvements by EGN-optimized unconstrained distributions over linear AWGN optimized MB distributions are up to 59%. This general behavior is observed in 9-channel and fully loaded WDM experiments.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2752243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2752243","startPage":"4871","endPage":"4879","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8093713/08037974.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8093713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Comparison of Probabilistic Shaping Methods for Unrepeated Fiber Transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15, 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Comparison of Probabilistic Shaping Methods for Unrepeated Fiber Transmission","volume":"35","issue":"22","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2017","accessionNumber":"17352811","publicationDate":"1 Nov.15, 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8037974/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001732","fundingName":"DNRF","grantNumber":"DNRF123"},{"fundingName":"German Federal Ministry of Education and Research"},{"fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt Professorship"},{"fundingName":"FITweltweit program of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Comparison of Probabilistic Shaping Methods for Unrepeated Fiber Transmission","sourcePdf":"jlt-renner-2752243-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085457S","chronDate":"Nov.15, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8093713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8093713","articleId":"8037974","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8037978,"authors":[{"name":"Tingting Huang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University, Fujian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8037978/huang-2752238-small.gif","p":["Tingting Huang received the B.S. degree in automation from the Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2008, and the M.Sc. degree in control theory and control engineering from Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, in 2012.

For one data frame transmission, only one noninformation-bearing reference sub-carrier signal is required, and the reference of each information-bearing sub-carrier is its previous sub-carrier signal, thus high energy efficiency is attained. If channel response changes during a frame period, the time diversity is achieved. In addition, the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is considered, and it is found that adjacent symbols with a large Euclidean distance achieve a low PAPR. Accordingly, a low-complexity PAPR reduction algorithm is proposed based on symbol-interleaving with only one inverse fast Fourier transform processor. The simulation results demonstrate that the system with the proposed algorithm dramatically reduces the PAPR. Analytical bit-error-rate expressions are derived and verified by simulations over additive white Gaussian noise and multi-path fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2752238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2752238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08037978.pdf","startPage":"18793","endPage":"18803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Carrier $M$ -Ary Differential Chaos Shift Keying System With Low PAPR","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Carrier $M$ -Ary Differential Chaos Shift Keying System With Low PAPR","volume":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8037978/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17266497","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037978/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSF of China","grantNumber":"61671395"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grants Council under the GRF","grantNumber":"11208515"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Multi-Carrier $M$ -Ary Differential Chaos Shift Keying System With Low PAPR","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2752238-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073548S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8037978","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8037982,"authors":[{"name":"Haiyan Guo","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology (Ministry of Education), Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8037982/guo-2752199-small.gif","p":["Haiyan Guo received the B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in signal and information processing from the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NUPT), Nanjing, China, in 2005 and 2011, respectively.

In order to achieve the secrecy rate maximum, we further study on the power allocation among the source, relays, and jammers under two assumptions of the wiretap link's channel state information. We derive the closed-form optimal solutions by first allocating the transmit power at the source within different ranges to consider all the possible relay selection schemes in which different numbers of relays are employed, and then transforming the multivariable power allocation problem to a set of single-variable optimization subproblems. Our numerical results show the superiority of the proposed JCBJ scheme and the proposed power allocation strategies.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2752199","publicationTitle":"IEEE

access, radio-over-fiber (RoF) starts to gain more and more momentum. Various techniques already exist, using analog (ARoF) or digitized (DRoF) radio signals over fiber; each with their own advantages and disadvantages. By transmitting a sigma delta modulated signal over fiber (SDoF), a similar immunity to impairments as DRoF can be obtained while maintaining the low complexity of ARoF. This letter describes a detailed experimental comparison between ARoF and SDoF that quantifies the improvement in linearity and error vector magnitude (EVM) of SDoF over ARoF. The experiments were carried out using a 16-QAM constellation with a baudrate from 20 to 125 MBd modulated on a central carrier frequency of 1 GHz. The sigma delta modulator runs at 8 or 13.5 Gbps. A high-speed vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) operating at 850 nm is used to transmit the signal over 200-m multimode fiber. The receiver amplifies the electrical signals and subsequently filters to recover the original RF signal. Compared with ARoF, improvements exceeding 40 dB were measured on the third order intermodulation products when SDoF was employed, the EVM improves between 2.4 and 7.1 dB.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2017.2752284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2017.2752284","startPage":"1808","endPage":"1811","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/8060641/08037990.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8060641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison Between Analog Radio-Over-Fiber and Sigma Delta Modulated Radio-Over-Fiber","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1, 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Comparison Between Analog Radio-Over-Fiber and Sigma Delta Modulated Radio-Over-Fiber","volume":"29","issue":"21","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17224703","publicationDate":"1 Nov.1, 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8037990/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission in the Framework of the 2020-ICT-2014-2 Project Flex5Gware","grantNumber":"671563"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004003","fundingName":"iMinds IoT Research Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007229","fundingName":"Special Research Fund (BOF)\u2013Ghent University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"ERC Advanced","grantNumber":"695495"},{"fundingName":"\u201cATTO, A new concept for ultrahigh capacity wireless networks.\u201d"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison Between Analog Radio-Over-Fiber and Sigma Delta Modulated Radio-Over-Fiber","sourcePdf":"lpt-breyne-2752284-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114727S","chronDate":"Nov.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"8060641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8060641","articleId":"8037990","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8037992,"authors":[{"name":"Siew-Kei Lam","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Siew-Kei","lastName":"Lam","orcid":"0000-0002-8346-2635","id":"37332707100"},{"name":"Teck Chuan Lim","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Teck Chuan","lastName":"Lim","id":"37086437382"},{"name":"Meiqing Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Meiqing","lastName":"Wu","id":"38468861600"},{"name":"Bin Cao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Cao","id":"37086443938"},{"name":"Bhavan A.

In this brief, we present a novel data-path transposition strategy for the hardware design of the FAST corner detector. The proposed design transposes the data-path of the conventional architecture to enable partial evaluation of multiple corners in a pipelined manner, which reduces the size of the window buffer. Further area savings were achieved by combining the operations for computing the corner scores and determining the member vectors. We show that the proposed design on 180-nm CMOS technology leads to about 22% reduction in the critical path delay and lesser area compared to the previously reported architecture, without a notable difference in energy consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8037992/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","volume":"65","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"18042729","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8037992/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Area-Time Efficient FAST Corner Detector Using Data-Path Transposition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area-Time Efficient FAST Corner Detector Using Data-Path Transposition","sourcePdf":"tcsii-lam-2752259-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095057S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8447179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8447179","articleId":"8037992","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8037997,"authors":[{"name":"Nelly Pustelnik","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, ENS de Lyon, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard, CNRS, Laboratoire de Physique, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Nelly","lastName":"Pustelnik","id":"37601299500"},{"name":"Laurent Condat","affiliation":["CNRS, GIPSA-Lab, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Condat","id":"37294569700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"8037997","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":520},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Proximal splitting algorithms for convex optimization are largely used in signal and image processing.

This paper presents new theoretical and practical results about the separability of the SSA and introduces a new method called sliding SSA. First, the SSA is combined with an unsupervised classification algorithm to provide a fully automatic data-driven component extraction method for which we investigate the limitations for components separation in a theoretical study. Second, the detailed automatic SSA method is used to design an approach based on a sliding analysis window, which provides better results than the classical SSA method when analyzing nonstationary signals with a time-varying number of components. Finally, the proposed sliding SSA method is compared to the empirical mode decomposition and to the synchrosqueezed short-time Fourier transform, applied on both synthetic and real-world signals.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time series analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Spectral analysis","Indexes","Trajectory","Market research","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal classification","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised classification algorithm","fully automatic data-driven component extraction method","sliding analysis window","nonstationary signals","sliding SSA method","real-world signals","sliding singular spectrum analysis","signal decomposition technique","component separation","data-driven nonstationary signal decomposition tool","automatic SSA method","synthetic signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Singular spectrum analysis","empirical mode decomposition","synchrosqueezing","non-stationary signals"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2752720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8105925/08038004.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8105925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2752720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Sliding Singular Spectrum Analysis: A Data-Driven Nonstationary Signal Decomposition Tool","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038004","supplementGroup":[{"repository":"code-ocean","type":"algorithm","badge":"Available","badgeMsg":"This document includes code submitted by the author.","supplement":[{"doi":"10.24433/CO.8ceb2ff6-9019-4ad3-8234-49251ba3cc14","uri":"https://codeocean.com/2017/09/29/the-sliding-singular-spectrum-analysis-colon-a-data-driven-non-stationary-signal-decomposition-tool","name":"The Sliding Singular Spectrum Analysis: a Data-Driven Non-Stationary Signal Decomposition Tool","language":"MATLAB","widgetUrl":"https://codeocean.com/widget.js?id=8ceb2ff6-9019-4ad3-8234-49251ba3cc14","badgeType":"Code-Available"}]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Sliding Singular Spectrum Analysis: A Data-Driven Nonstationary Signal Decomposition Tool","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038004/","volume":"66","issue":"1","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8038004/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17372624","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"French ANR ASTRES","grantNumber":"ANR-13-BS03-0002-01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Sliding Singular Spectrum Analysis: A Data-Driven Nonstationary Signal Decomposition Tool","sourcePdf":"tsp-fourer-2752720-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096985S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8105925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"8105925","articleId":"8038004","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8038006,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Recently, an evolving GNN (eGNN) has been originated with an advancement to the GNN that has the ability to explore and accommodate input information more effectively and results in the performance improvement of classification systems. For each input, the shape and the size of granules are adjusted with randomly selected weight parameters, and accordingly, the network architecture of the eGNN is determined. In this direction, the present paper aims to improve the performance of eGNN by deterministically initializing its weight parameters and reforming the network architecture through encoding the domain knowledge using a rough-set-theoretic method. We also propose to use a back error propagation learning algorithm for the eGNN. The resultant network called a progressive GNN (PGNN) becomes more dynamic in the learning process and thus minimizes the learning time with improved accuracy. To justify the claim, we developed a PGNN-based classification model for land cover classification of both multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing images. Superiority of the model to similar other methods has been validated with performance measurement metrics such as overall accuracy, precision, recall, kappa coefficient, dispersion score, and computational time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038006/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17466307","volume":"10","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8038006/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Knowledge-Based Progressive Granular Neural Networks for Remote Sensing Image Classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge-Based Progressive Granular Neural Networks for Remote Sensing Image Classification","sourcePdf":"jstars-meher-2743982-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08546S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"8170468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170468","articleId":"8038006","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8038007,"authors":[{"name":"Adnan Gavili","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8053877/8038007/gavil-2752689-small.gif","p":["Adnan Gavili was born in Sanandaj, Kurdistan, Iran.

We define a set of energy-preserving shift operators that satisfy many properties similar to their counterparts in classical signal processing, but are different from the shift operators defined in the literature, such as the graph adjacency matrix and Laplacian matrix based shift operators, which modify the energy of a graph signal. We decouple the graph structure represented by eigengraphs and the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix or the Laplacian matrix. We show that the adjacency matrix of a graph is indeed a linear shift invariant (LSI) graph filter with respect to the defined shift operator. We further define autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions of signals on the graph, enabling us to obtain the solution to the optimal filtering on graphs, i.e., the corresponding Wiener filtering on graphs and the efficient spectra analysis and frequency domain filtering in parallel with those in classical signal processing. This new shift operator based GSP framework enables the signal analysis along a correlation structure defined by a graph shift manifold as opposed to classical signal processing operating on the assumption of the correlation structure with a linear time shift manifold. Several illustrative simulations are presented to validate the performance of the designed optimal LSI filters.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2752689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8053877/08038007.pdf","startPage":"6303","endPage":"6318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8053877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2752689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Shift Operator, Graph Frequency, and Optimal Filtering in Graph Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038007","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1, 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"On the Shift Operator, Graph Frequency, and Optimal Filtering in Graph Signal Processing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038007/","publicationDate":"1 Dec.1, 2017","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17240962","htmlLink":"/document/8038007/","volume":"65","issue":"23","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"RGPIN239031"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Shift Operator, Graph Frequency, and Optimal Filtering in Graph Signal Processing","sourcePdf":"tsp-zhang-2752689-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089501S","chronDate":"Dec.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8053877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8053877","articleId":"8038007","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038008,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Dal Pozzolo","affiliation":["Machine Learning Group, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8417016/8038008/dalpo-2736643-small.gif","p":["Andrea Dal Pozzolo received the master\u2019s degree (cum laude) from the Faculty of Statistics, Universit\u00e1 di Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree from the Machine Learning Group, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium, in 2015, where he was involved in machine learning and statistical techniques for fraud detection.","He is currently a consultant for major Banks and Insurance companies.

In fact, this problem involves a number of relevant challenges, namely: concept drift (customers' habits evolve and fraudsters change their strategies over time), class imbalance (genuine transactions far outnumber frauds), and verification latency (only a small set of transactions are timely checked by investigators). However, the vast majority of learning algorithms that have been proposed for fraud detection rely on assumptions that hardly hold in a real-world fraud-detection system (FDS). This lack of realism concerns two main aspects: 1) the way and timing with which supervised information is provided and 2) the measures used to assess fraud-detection performance. This paper has three major contributions. First, we propose, with the help of our industrial partner, a formalization of the fraud-detection problem that realistically describes the operating conditions of FDSs that everyday analyze massive streams of credit card transactions. We also illustrate the most appropriate performance measures to be used for fraud-detection purposes. Second, we design and assess a novel learning strategy that effectively addresses class imbalance, concept drift, and verification latency. Third, in our experiments, we demonstrate the impact of class unbalance and concept drift in a real-world data stream containing more than 75 million transactions, authorized over a time window of three years.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2736643","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8417016/08038008.pdf","startPage":"3784","endPage":"3797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8417016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2736643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Realistic Modeling and a Novel Learning Strategy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Realistic Modeling and a Novel Learning Strategy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038008/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"20 July 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17936059","pubMedId":"28920909","htmlLink":"/document/8038008/","volume":"29","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Doctiris Scholarship"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004744","fundingName":"Innoviris"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Realistic Modeling and a Novel Learning Strategy","sourcePdf":"tnnls-dalpozzolo-2736643-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151007S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8417016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8417016","articleId":"8038008","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038012,"authors":[{"name":"Pilar Meneses de Quevedo","affiliation":["E.T.S. de Ingenieros Industriales, University of Castilla-La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8595470/8038012/deque-2752303-small.gif","p":["Pilar Meneses de Quevedo (S\u201917) received the Ingeniero Industrial degree from the University of Cantabria, Spain, in 2005 and the M.Sc. degree from the Universidad Pontificia of Comillas, Madrid, Spain, in 2008.

EV introduce new charging demands that change the traditional demand profiles and RES are characterized by their high variability. This paper presents a new multistage distribution expansion planning model where investments in distribution network assets, RES, ESS, and EV charging stations are jointly considered. The charging demand necessary for EV transportation is performed using a vehicle model based on travel patterns. The variability associated with RES along with the demand requires the incorporation of uncertainty, which is characterized through a set of scenarios. These scenarios are generated by the k-means++ clustering technique that allows keeping the correlation in the information of the uncertainty sources. The resulting stochastic program is driven by the minimization of the present value of the total expected cost including investment, maintenance, production, losses, and non-supplied energy. The associated scenario-based deterministic equivalent is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, which can be solved by commercial software.

modulation (256-QAM) interleaved single-carrier frequency-division multiplexing (I-SC-FDM) over 10-km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) for optical interconnects. I-SC-FDM has lower peak-to-average power ratio and lower computational complexity of transmitter compared with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). High-level QAM can achieve high spectral efficiency; however, it is susceptible to both linear and nonlinear distortions. The frequency-domain one-tap equalizer and the time-domain decision-feedback equalizer with recursive least square and Volterra algorithm are jointly employed to eliminate the distortions for the 256-QAM I-SC-FDM. After 10-km SSMF, I-SC-FDM has better performance than localized SC-FDM and OFDM. Therefore, I-SC-FDM shows the potential for short-reach optical interconnects.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2017.2752215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/8060641/08038019.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2017.2752215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8060641","startPage":"1796","endPage":"1799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"256-QAM Interleaved Single Carrier FDM for Short-Reach Optical Interconnects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038019","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"256-QAM Interleaved Single Carrier FDM for Short-Reach Optical Interconnects","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038019/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"21","publicationDate":"1 Nov.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"17224720","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038019/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61475094 and 61331010"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2016YFB0800302"},{"fundingName":"BUPT Excellent Ph.D. Students Foundation","grantNumber":"CX2016311"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"256-QAM Interleaved Single Carrier FDM for Short-Reach Optical Interconnects","sourcePdf":"lpt-zhou-2752215-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081959S","chronDate":"Nov.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"8060641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8060641","articleId":"8038019","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8038020,"authors":[{"name":"Giulia Da Poian","affiliation":["Dipartimento Politecnico di Ingegneria e Architettura, University of Udine, Udine, Italy"],"firstName":"Giulia","lastName":"Da Poian","orcid":"0000-0002-8960-1077","id":"37085654277"},{"name":"Christopher J Rozell","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Christopher J","lastName":"Rozell","id":"37395723500"},{"name":"Riccardo Bernardini","affiliation":["Dipartimento Politecnico di Ingegneria e Architettura, University of Udine"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Bernardini","id":"37285036000"},{"name":"Roberto Rinaldo","affiliation":["Dipartimento Politecnico di Ingegneria e Architettura, University of Udine"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Rinaldo","id":"37266077800"},{"name":"Gari D.

Long-term recording of ECG signals can be useful for diagnostic purposes and to monitor the evolution of several widespread diseases. In particular, beat-to-beat intervals provide important clinical information, and these can be derived from the ECG signal by computing the distance between QRS complexes (R-peaks). Numerous methods for R-peak detection are available for uncompressed ECG. However, in the case of compressed sensed data, signal reconstruction can be performed with relatively complex optimization algorithms, which may require significant energy consumption. This paper addresses the problem of heart rate estimation from CS ECG recordings, avoiding the reconstruction of the entire signal. Methods: We consider a framework, where the ECG signals are represented under the form of CS linear measurements. The QRS locations are estimated in the compressed domain by computing the correlation of the compressed ECG and a known QRS template. Results: Experiments on actual ECG signals show that our novel solution is competitive with methods applied to the reconstructed signals. Conclusion: Avoiding the reconstruction procedure, the proposed method proves to be very convenient for real-time low-power applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/8360977/08038020.pdf","startPage":"1349","endPage":"1358","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2017.2752422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2017.2752422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8360977","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matched Filtering for Heart Rate Estimation on Compressive Sensing ECG Measurements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical measurement","Electrocardiography","Compressed sensing","Sensors","Estimation","Complexity theory","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body sensor networks","compressed sensing","diseases","electrocardiography","matched filters","medical signal detection","optimisation","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beat-to-beat intervals","QRS complexes","uncompressed ECG","compressed sensed data","signal reconstruction","heart rate estimation","CS ECG recordings","CS linear measurements","compressed domain","actual ECG signals","low-complexity compression framework","electrocardiogram signals","wireless body sensor networks","matched filtering","compressive sensing ECG measurements","R-peak detection","complex optimization algorithms","QRS template"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beat detection","compressive beat detection","compressive matched filter","compressive sensing (CS)","ECG compression"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Aged","Aged, 80 and over","Algorithms","Data Compression","Electrocardiography","Female","Heart Rate","Humans","Male","Middle Aged","Young Adult"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Matched Filtering for Heart Rate Estimation on Compressive Sensing ECG Measurements","volume":"65","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8038020/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17768294","pubMedId":"28920895","dateOfInsertion":"18 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matched Filtering for Heart Rate Estimation on Compressive Sensing ECG Measurements","sourcePdf":"tbme-dapoian-2752422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128398S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"8360977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8360977","articleId":"8038020","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8038021,"authors":[{"name":"Ra\u00fal Guerra","affiliation":["Integrated System Design Division, Institute of Applied Microelectronics, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/8100662/8038021/guerr-2737958-small.gif","p":["Ra\u00fal Guerra was born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain, in\n 1988.

Nevertheless, the huge amount of information provided by hyperspectral images also has a downside, since it has to be processed and analyzed. For such purpose, parallel hardware devices, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphic processing units (GPUs), are typically used, especially for hyperspectral imaging applications under real-time constraints. However, developing hardware applications typically requires expertise in the specific targeted device, as well as in the tools and methodologies that can be used to perform the implementation of the desired algorithms in that device. In this scenario, the Open Computing Language (OpenCL) emerges as a very interesting solution in which a single high-level language can be used to efficiently develop applications in multiple and different hardware devices. In this work, the parallel Fast Algorithm for Linearly Unmixing Hyperspectral Images (pFUN) has been implemented in two different NVIDIA GPUs, the GeForce GTX 980 and the Tesla K40c, using OpenCL. The obtained results are compared with the results provided by the previously developed NVIDIA CUDA implementation of the pFUN algorithm for the same GPU devices for comparing the efficiency of OpenCL against a more specific synthesis design language for the targeted hardware devices, such as CUDA is for NVIDIA GPUs. Moreover, the FUN algorithm has also been implemented into a Bitware Stratix V Altera FPGA, using OpenCL, for comparing the results that can be obtained using OpenCL when targeting different devices and architectures. The obtained results demonstrate the suitability of the followed methodology in the sense that it allows the achievement of efficient FPGA and GPU implementations able to cope with the stringent requirements imposed by hyperspectral imaging systems.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2737958","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/8100662/08038021.pdf","startPage":"4879","endPage":"4897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2737958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8100662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Evaluation of Different High-Performance Computing Platforms for Hyperspectral Imaging: An OpenCL-Based Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","displayDocTitle":"On the Evaluation of Different High-Performance Computing Platforms for Hyperspectral Imaging: An OpenCL-Based Approach","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038021/","accessionNumber":"17806999","volume":"10","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Government and European Union (FEDER funds)","grantNumber":"TEC2014-58036-C4-4-R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Evaluation of Different High-Performance Computing Platforms for Hyperspectral Imaging: An OpenCL-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"jstars-lopez-2737958-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18113S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"8100662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8100662","articleId":"8038021","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038029,"authors":[{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinho","lastName":"Choi","orcid":"0000-0002-4895-6680","id":"37085352809"},{"name":"Youngwook Ko","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen\u2019s University Belfast, Belfast, U.K."],"firstName":"Youngwook","lastName":"Ko","orcid":"0000-0002-0199-652X","id":"37085432621"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8038029","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":590},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Hamming distance","OFDM","Modulation","Convolutional codes","Fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","error statistics","fading channels","OFDM modulation","trellis coded modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trellis coded modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","Hamming distance","mapping rules","diversity order","frequency-selective fading channels","multicarrier transmission technique","index modulation","index error","index symbols","detection performance","OFDM-IM","TCM","active subcarriers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Trellis coded modulation","index modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with index modulation (IM) is a multicarrier transmission technique for frequency-selective fading channels.

These digital measurements reflect the precision of the installed sensors, which are vulnerable to the injection of unknown parameters in the form of device malfunction and cyberattacks. This may question the operational security and reliability of many cyberphysical infrastructure such as smart grid. To resolve this issue, a multisensor temporal prediction based wide-area control scheme is proposed in this paper. The feasibility of the designed scheme is verified in an advanced synchrophasor measurements based wide-area monitoring and control system (WAMCS). This WAMCS adopts a flexible ac transmission system device (the primary controller) for controlling the smart grid's voltage profile. The algorithm is validated in a real-time environment with an innovative software-in-the-loop testing setup. The performance of the proposed technique in the presence of false-data-injection attacks shows promising results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038032/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18492439","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Prediction Algorithm to Enhance Grid Resilience Toward Cyber Attacks in WAMCS Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Prediction Algorithm to Enhance Grid Resilience Toward Cyber Attacks in WAMCS Applications","sourcePdf":"jsyst-muyeen-2741483-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.208091S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8649702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8649702","articleId":"8038032","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":8038035,"authors":[{"name":"Shengchao Shi","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shengchao","lastName":"Shi","orcid":"0000-0002-6633-1983","id":"37086162476"},{"name":"Kang An","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"An","orcid":"0000-0003-4720-0635","id":"37070395500"},{"name":"Guangxia Li","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Guangxia","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-3678-6239","id":"37405544600"},{"name":"Zhiqiang Li","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37597759600"},{"name":"Hongpeng Zhu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hongpeng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086295076"},{"name":"Gan Zheng","affiliation":["Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, U.K."],"firstName":"Gan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085352768"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8038035","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":736},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Interference","Satellite broadcasting","Power control","Channel estimation","Uplink","Fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cognitive radio","power control","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","satellite links","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive satellite terrestrial networks","desired satellite link","power control scheme","optimal power control","imperfect channel state information","spectrum scarcity","imperfect CSI","harmful terrestrial interference link","pilot-based channel estimation","back-off interference power constraint","outage capacity","communication quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power control","imperfect channel state information","cognitive satellite terrestrial networks","outage capacity"]}],"abstract":"To address the spectrum scarcity in future satellite communications, employing the cognitive technique in the satellite systems is considered as a promising candidate, which leads to an advanced architecture known as cognitive satellite terrestrial networks. Power control is a significant research challenge in cognitive satellite terrestrial networks, especially when the perfect channel state information (CSI) of satellite or terrestrial links is unavailable. In this context, we investigate the impact of imperfect CSI of both desired satellite link and harmful terrestrial interference link on the power control scheme in cognitive satellite terrestrial networks. By adopting a pilot-based channel estimation of satellite link and a back-off interference power constraint of terrestrial interference link, a novel power control scheme is presented to maximize the outage capacity of the satellite user while guaranteeing the communication quality of primary terrestrial user. Extensive numerical results quantitatively demonstrate the effect of various system parameters on the proposed power control scheme in cognitive satellite terrestrial networks with imperfect CSI.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2017.2752160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/8293945/08038035.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2017.2752160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8293945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Control in Cognitive Satellite Terrestrial Networks With Imperfect Channel State Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038035/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Control in Cognitive Satellite Terrestrial Networks With Imperfect Channel State Information","volume":"7","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17595987","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8038035/","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundations of China","grantNumber":"61571464, 61601511, 91338201, 91438109 and 61401507"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/N007840/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Control in Cognitive Satellite Terrestrial Networks With Imperfect Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"lwc-li-2752160-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057664S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8293945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8293945","articleId":"8038035","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8038046,"authors":[{"name":"Afan Ali","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Afan","lastName":"Ali","id":"37086133016"},{"name":"Fan Yangyu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Yangyu","id":"37085753404"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"8038046","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2154},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038046","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Training","Signal processing algorithms","Feature extraction","Machine learning","Cost function","Fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["higher order statistics","learning (artificial intelligence)","modulation","signal classification","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic modulation classification","sparse autoencoders","deep learning autoencoder network","negative weights","part-based data representation","autoencoder with nonnegativity constraint","ANC","fourth-order cumulants","modulated signals","reconstruction error minimization","fading channel","signal length"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autoencoder","automatic modulation classification","cumulants","deep learning networks","nonnegativity constraints"]}],"abstract":"We demonstrate a novel method for the automatic modulation classification based on a deep learning autoencoder network, trained by a nonnegativity constraint algorithm.

A Bayesian extension of the proposed MT-GQLRT is also developed that is based on selection of a Gaussian probability model that best empirically fits a transformed conditional probability distribution of the data.

The proposed DDC consists of a mixer and a resampling filter. The resampling filter can work at much higher clock rate. The reason is that all the single-cycle recursive loops in the resampling filter are pipelined by using either real/imaginary part-time multiplexing or parallel processing technique. With features like arbitrary sampling rate conversion, and dynamic configuration, the proposed design is highly flexible, so that it can generate a down-converted output with sampling rate, selectable within the range of 1 kS/s-225 MS/s. Moreover, the flexibility is further improved by being able to specify the output sampling rate and center frequency to a resolution of less than 1 S/s. The experimental results show that the proposed design can achieve the same functionality as the existing work but with fewer hardware resources.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2748603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8118264/08038064.pdf","startPage":"3548","endPage":"3552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8118264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2748603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and FPGA Implementation of a Reconfigurable Digital Down Converter for Wideband Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Design and FPGA Implementation of a Reconfigurable Digital Down Converter for Wideband Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038064/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17390432","htmlLink":"/document/8038064/","volume":"25","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501103 and 61472072"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and FPGA Implementation of a Reconfigurable Digital Down Converter for Wideband Applications","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-liu-2748603-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073004S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8118264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8118264","articleId":"8038064","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038066,"authors":[{"name":"Tiago Costa","affiliation":["Bioelectronic Systems Lab, Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA","INESC-ID, Lisboa, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/8049546/8038066/costa-2743685-small.gif","p":["Tiago Costa received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical\n engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering, all from Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico\n (IST), University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal, in 2006, 2008, and 2014, respectively.

To this end, the detection system is required to be compact, portable, and low power consuming at the same time that a maximum signal to noise ratio is maintained. This paper reports a CMOS front-end with integrated magnetoresistive sensors for biomolecular recognition detection applications. Based on the characterization of the GMR sensor's signal and noise, CMOS building blocks (i.e., current source, multiplexers, and preamplifier) were designed targeting a negligible noise when compared with the GMR sensor's noise and a low power consumption. The CMOS front-end was fabricated using AMS 0.35 \u03bcm technology and the magnetoresistive sensors were post-fabricated on top of the CMOS chip with high yield (97.9%). Due to its low circuit noise (16 nV/\u221aHz) and over all equivalent magnetic noise (11.5 nT/\u221aHz), the full system was able to detect 250 nm magnetic nanoparticles with a circuit imposed signal-to-noise ratio degradation of only -1.4 dB. Furthermore, the low power consumption (6.5 mW) and small dimensions (7.59 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) of the presented solution guarantees the portability of the detection system allowing its usage at the point-of-care.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038066/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038066/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17205616","pubMedId":"28920908","volume":"11","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS Front-End With Integrated Magnetoresistive Sensors for Biomolecular Recognition Detection Applications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Funds through Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia (FCT)","grantNumber":"EXPL/EEI-ELC/1029/2012, PTDC/EEI-PRO/3219/2012, UID/CEC/50021/2013, EXCL/CTM-NAN/0441/2012 and Pest-OE/CTM/LA0024/2011"},{"fundingName":"Ph.D. scholarship and Research Grant","grantNumber":"SFRH/BD/61569/2009 and SFRH/BPD/85455/2012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS Front-End With Integrated Magnetoresistive Sensors for Biomolecular Recognition Detection Applications","sourcePdf":"tbcas-costa-2743685-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097406S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"8049546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8049546","articleId":"8038066","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8038072,"authors":[{"name":"Arthur Mensch","affiliation":["Parietal Team, Paris-Saclay University, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8105925/8038072/mensc-2752697-small.gif","p":["Arthur Mensch received the Graduate degree from the Ecole\n Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France, in 2015, and the M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics from \u00c9cole Normale\n Sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan, Cachan, France.

Learned factors may be sparse or dense and/or nonnegative, which makes our algorithm suitable for dictionary learning, sparse component analysis, and nonnegative matrix factorization. Our algorithm streams matrix columns while subsampling them to iteratively learn the matrix factors. At each iteration, the row dimension of a new sample is reduced by subsampling, resulting in lower time complexity compared to a simple streaming algorithm. Our method comes with convergence guarantees to reach a stationary point of the matrix-factorization problem. We demonstrate its efficiency on massive functional magnetic resonance imaging data (2 TB), and on patches extracted from hyperspectral images (103 GB). For both problems, which involve different penalties on rows and columns, we obtain significant speed-ups compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038072/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2017","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17372625","volume":"66","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Subsampling for Factorizing Huge Matrices","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001665","fundingName":"ANR","grantNumber":"ANR-14-CE23-0003-01\u2014NiConnect and ANR-11-BINF-0004NiConnect"},{"fundingName":"European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation","grantNumber":"720270"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Subsampling for Factorizing Huge Matrices","sourcePdf":"tsp-mensch-2752697-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139751S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8105925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"8105925","articleId":"8038072","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8038074,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Abdollahzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Abdollahzadeh","id":"37589356800"},{"name":"Babak Mozafari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Babak","lastName":"Mozafari","id":"37268120400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8038074","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038074","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","Circuit faults","Time-domain analysis","Delay effects","Mathematical model","Tools"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system control","power system faults","power systems","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["swift time-domain analyses","delayless extraction","instantaneous symmetrical components","power system fault conditions","phasor domain","ISCs","sequence networks","positive- sequence components","negative-sequence components","time delay","phase quantities","EMTDC","PSCAD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delayless time-domain analysis","fault conditions","Fortescue transformation","instantaneous symmetrical components","sequence networks"]}],"abstract":"In addition to the originally defined complex symmetrical components in phasor domain, the instantaneous ones are essential for power system studies in the time domain.

This brief develops an analytic approach for delayless extraction of the ISCs from the phase quantities in fault conditions. It takes advantage of the superimposed value of quantities as well as the principles underlying the sequence networks so as to derive the positive- and negative-sequence components without introducing any time delay.

In particular, it is proved that the sum-capacity scaling is log SNR for the proposed one, whereas (2/3) log SNR for the conventional ones.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038077/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8038077/","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","accessionNumber":"17595956","volume":"7","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Scaling for D2D Aided Cooperative Relaying Systems Using NOMA","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Korea government (MSIT) (No This work was"},{"fundingName":"Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP)"},{"fundingName":"Korea government (MSIT) (A Study on Core Technology for Multidimensional Immersive Media Broadcasting and Communication)","grantNumber":"2016-0-00577"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Scaling for D2D Aided Cooperative Relaying Systems Using NOMA","sourcePdf":"lwc-lee-2752162-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052109S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8293945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"8293945","articleId":"8038077","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038078,"authors":[{"name":"Pilsoon Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Pilsoon","lastName":"Choi","orcid":"0000-0003-0856-9026","id":"37445500500"},{"name":"Ujwal Radhakrishna","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ujwal","lastName":"Radhakrishna","id":"37892423100"},{"name":"Chirn Chye Boon","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chirn Chye","lastName":"Boon","id":"37408579300"},{"name":"Li-Shiuan Peh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Li-Shiuan","lastName":"Peh","id":"37274794400"},{"name":"Dimitri Antoniadis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Dimitri","lastName":"Antoniadis","id":"37275120500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"8038078","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1287},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Radio frequency","Linearity","Transistors","Distortion","Logic gates","Voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","gallium compounds","HEMT circuits","III-V semiconductors","intermodulation distortion","microwave power amplifiers","silicon compounds","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF GaN power amplifiers","IEEE 802.11p standard","linearity enhancement","large-signal nonlinearity compensation technique","high power amplifier design","fully integrated GaN power amplifier","common-gate high-electron mobility transistors","common-source high-electron mobility transistors","two-tone intermodulation distortion testing","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-modulated signals","CS-CG configuration","frequency 6 GHz","size 0.25 mum","efficiency 31 percent","voltage 10 V","GaN","SiC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Device-to-device (D2D) communication","GaN","IEEE 802.11p","linearity","power amplifier","RF"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038078","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2017.2746673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2017.2746673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8059715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/8059715/08038078.pdf","startPage":"927","endPage":"929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linearity Enhancement of a Fully Integrated 6-GHz GaN Power Amplifier","abstract":"A large-signal nonlinearity compensation technique is developed to improve the linearity of RF GaN power amplifiers. The design of a high power amplifier employing both common-source (CS) and common-gate (CG) GaN high-electron mobility transistors is presented for the IEEE 802.11p standard. The power amplifier is fabricated in 0.25-\u03bcm GaNon-SiC technology and occupies 1.7 mm \u00d7 1.2 mm. The measurements show that 35-dBm output 1-dB compression point (OP1 dB) is obtained with 39-dBm OIP3 for two-tone intermodulation distortion testing. It also achieves 31% drain efficiency at 28.8-dBm output power with 10-V supply voltage considering a more than 6-dB back-off for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-modulated signals. Linearity enhancement by means of the proposed CS-CG configuration is demonstrated in a fully integrated GaN power amplifier at 6 GHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038078/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038078/","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17240841","volume":"27","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Linearity Enhancement of a Fully Integrated 6-GHz GaN Power Amplifier","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Research Foundation Singapore through the Singapore MIT Alliance for Research and Technology\u2019s Low Energy Electronic Systems research program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linearity Enhancement of a Fully Integrated 6-GHz GaN Power Amplifier","sourcePdf":"lmwc-choi-2746673-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046117S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"8059715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8059715","articleId":"8038078","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8038085,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Cagatay Cirik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali Cagatay","lastName":"Cirik","orcid":"0000-0002-9101-9334","id":"37085390989"},{"name":"Naveen Mysore Balasubramanya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Naveen","lastName":"Mysore Balasubramanya","id":"37085785944"},{"name":"Lutz Lampe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Lutz","lastName":"Lampe","orcid":"0000-0002-6583-1978","id":"37273228000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8038085","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1609},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","NOMA","Uplink","Matching pursuit algorithms","Wireless communication","Compressed sensing","5G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","compressed sensing","multi-access systems","multiuser detection","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient multiuser detection","transmit symbol estimate","improved MUD performance","ADMM","compressive sensing","uplink grant-free NOMA","nonorthogonal multiple access","primary candidate","massive connectivity","fifth generation wireless communication systems","low-complexity NOMA mechanism","user activity detection","adaptive alternating direction method-of-multipliers","transmitted data detection","active user set"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM)","compressive sensing","non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)"]}],"abstract":"Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is considered a primary candidate addressing the challenge of massive connectivity in fifth generation wireless communication systems.

The proposed algorithm leverages the transmit symbol estimate and active user set as \u201cprior knowledge,\u201d which can be obtained from the previous iterations/time intervals, for improved MUD performance.

Chen-Harker-Kanzow-Smale (CHKS) smooth function into the C-support vector machine deformation algorithm. A set of seven characteristic parameters is selected from a range of parameters of communication signals including instantaneous amplitude, phase, and frequency. And the Newton-Armijo algorithm is utilized to train the proposed algorithm, namely, smooth CHKS smooth support vector machine (SCHKS-SSVM). Compared with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm not only solves the non-differentiable problem of the second order objective function, but also reduces the recognition error. It significantly improves the training speed and also saves a large amount of storage space through large-scale sorting problems. The simulation results show that the recognition rate of the algorithm can batch training. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is suitable for solving the problem of high dimension and its recognition can exceed 95% when the signal-to-noise ratio is no less than 10 dB.","doi":"10.21629/JSEE.2017.04.01","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.21629/JSEE.2017.04.01","startPage":"627","endPage":"633","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/8038194/08038198.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation recognition of communication signals based on SCHKS-SSVM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Modulation recognition of communication signals based on SCHKS-SSVM","volume":"28","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17561646","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Modulation recognition of communication signals based on SCHKS-SSVM","sourcePdf":"627633.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044606S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","isNumber":"8038194","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8038198","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038199,"authors":[{"name":"Hongwei Wang","affiliation":["Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Hongwei","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Xiangyu Fan","affiliation":["Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Xiangyu","lastName":"Fan"},{"name":"You Chen","affiliation":["Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"You","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Yuanzhi Yang","affiliation":["Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Yuanzhi","lastName":"Yang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1004-4132"}],"articleNumber":"8038199","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information (BIAI)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Information entropy","Transforms","Signal detection","Signal to noise ratio","Time-frequency analysis","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","Fourier transforms","frequency modulation","Gaussian noise","Hough transforms","probability","radar detection","radar receivers","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiLFM signal detection","radar-reconnaissance interception receiver","low signal-noise ratio","LFM signal","Gaussian white noise","dimension","WHT algorithm","WHT domain slice","polar radius","angle slice","disturbance terms","signal detection procedure","periodic WHT","Wigner-Hough transform","probability density functions","weight factor","WHTE treatment","double-deck weight","information size"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["low signal-to-noise ratio","linear frequency modulated signal","probability density function","Wigner-Hough transform (WHT)","signal detection","entropy of slice"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038199","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/8038194/08038199.pdf","startPage":"634","endPage":"642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.21629/JSEE.2017.04.02","doi":"10.21629/JSEE.2017.04.02","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038194","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wigner-Hough transform based on slice's entropy and its application to multi-LFM signal detection","abstract":"To enhance the capacity of the radar-reconnaissance interception receiver recognizing linear frequency modulated (LFM) at a low signal-noise ratio, this paper presents Wigner-Hough transform (WHT) of the LFM signal and its corresponding characteristics, derives the probability density functions of the LFM signal and Gaussian white noise within WHT based on entropy (WHTE), dimension under different assumptions and puts forward a WHT algorithm based on entropy of slice to improve the capacity of detecting the LFM signal.

This paper presents a multi-narrowband signals sampling and reconstruction model based on AIC and block sparsity. To overcome the practical problems, the block sparsity is divided into uniform block and non-uniform block situations, and the block restricted isometry property and sub-sampling limit in different situations are analyzed respectively in detail. Theoretical analysis proves that using the block sparsity in AIC can reduce the restricted isometric constant, increase the reconstruction probability and reduce the sub-sampling rate. Simulation results show that the proposed model can complete sub-sampling and reconstruction for multi-narrowband signals. This paper extends the application range of AIC from the finite information rate signal to the multi-narrowband signals by using the potential relevance of support sets.

The standard method based on fixed threshold is too susceptible to both illumination variations and interference. To overcome issues above, a robust detection algorithm with triple constraints for cooperative targets based on spectral residual (TCSR) is proposed. Firstly, by designing an asymmetric cooperative target, which comprises red background, green H and triangle target, the captured original image is converted into a Lab color space, whose saliency map is yielded by constructing the spectral residual. Then, the triple constraints are developed according to the prior knowledge of the cooperative target. Finally, the salient region in saliency map is considered as the cooperative target, and it meets the triple constraints. Experimental results in complex environments show that the proposed TCSR outperforms the standard methods in higher detection accuracy and lower false alarm rate.","doi":"10.21629/JSEE.2017.04.04","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/8038194/08038201.pdf","startPage":"654","endPage":"660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.21629/JSEE.2017.04.04","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust detection algorithm with triple constraints for cooperative target based on spectral residual","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Robust detection algorithm with triple constraints for cooperative target based on spectral residual","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038201/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17595031","volume":"28","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Robust detection algorithm with triple constraints for cooperative target based on spectral residual","sourcePdf":"654660.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025201S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","isNumber":"8038194","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","articleId":"8038201","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038202,"authors":[{"name":"Hefei Zheng","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Radio Metrology and Measurement, The Second Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, Beijing 100854, China"],"firstName":"Hefei","lastName":"Zheng"},{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Radio Metrology and Measurement, The Second Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, Beijing 100854, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Wenming Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Radio Metrology and Measurement, The Second Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, Beijing 100854, China"],"firstName":"Wenming","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Lianshan Gao","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Radio Metrology and Measurement, The Second Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, Beijing 100854, China"],"firstName":"Lianshan","lastName":"Gao"},{"name":"Keming Feng","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Radio Metrology and Measurement, The Second Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, Beijing 100854, China"],"firstName":"Keming","lastName":"Feng"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1004-4132"}],"articleNumber":"8038202","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information (BIAI)","url":"#"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038202","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hydrogen","Frequency modulation","Cavity resonators","Masers","Dispersion","Resonant frequency","Absorption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crystal oscillators","frequency modulation","hydrogen","masers","optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single frequency modulation","passive hydrogen maser","modulation transfer spectroscopy","hydrogen transition","passive hydrogen servo loops","single modulation frequency","frequency discrimination","error signals","crystal oscillator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["passive hydrogen maser","single frequency modulation","frequency discrimination"]}],"abstract":"Based on the theory of the passive hydrogen maser, along with the technology of frequency modulation and modulation transfer spectroscopy, the theoretical expression of the single frequency modulation for the passive hydrogen maser and the function of the cavity and H line error signals separation are derived, which are basically coincident with the experiment.

Based on the received first order electric field expression, a closed-form of cross sections is derived to account for the case of receiving antenna array being mounted on the shipborne platform. The uniform linear motion and sway motion components are assumed to be responsible for the observed differences in comparison with the bistatic fixed antenna case. Correspondingly, simulations are conducted to study the sea clutter spectral characteristics for these two cases versus different system parameters and sea state conditions. It is shown numerically that the forward motion component will spread the Bragg lines severely and the influence triggered by the sway motion can be explained as the Bessel function modulation of the ordinary sea clutter spectra. The obtained results have important implications in the application of shipborne HFSWR technology to ocean remote sensing and target detection.","doi":"10.21629/JSEE.2017.04.07","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.21629/JSEE.2017.04.07","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/8038194/08038204.pdf","startPage":"681","endPage":"689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"First order sea clutter cross section for bistatic shipborne HFSWR","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"First order sea clutter cross section for bistatic shipborne HFSWR","volume":"28","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17561650","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038204/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"First order sea clutter cross section for bistatic shipborne HFSWR","sourcePdf":"681689.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028344S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","isNumber":"8038194","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8038204","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038205,"authors":[{"name":"Mohaned Giess Shokrallah Ahmed","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, CN"],"firstName":"Mohaned Giess Shokrallah","lastName":"Ahmed"},{"name":"Bin Tang","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, CN"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Tang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1004-4132"}],"articleNumber":"8038205","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information (BIAI)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Sorting","Euclidean distance","Pulse measurements","Shape","Radar countermeasures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","fuzzy set theory","interference suppression","radar clutter","radar detection","radar signal processing","signal sampling","sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symmetry measure distance","cluster pulses","density filtering algorithm","noise pulses","missing pulses","PSBRS algorithm","radar signal","symmetry clustering perspective","electronic support measure system","threatening signals","interleaved pulse","Euclidean distance","AFCM algorithm","point symmetry based radar sorting","alternative fuzzy c-means algorithm","DF algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sorting radar pulse","symmetry","alternative fuzzy c-means","noise","missing pulse"]}],"abstract":"The main function of electronic support measure system is to detect threatening signals in order to take countermeasures against them. To accomplish this objective, a process of associating each interleaved pulse with its emitter must be done. This process is termed sorting or de-interleaving. A novel point symmetry based radar sorting (PSBRS) algorithm is addressed. In order to deal with all kinds of radar signals, the symmetry measure distance is used to cluster pulses instead of the conventional Euclidean distance. The reference points of the symmetrical clusters are initialized by the alternative fuzzy c-means (AFCM) algorithm to ameliorate the effects of noise and the false sorting. Besides, the density filtering (DF) algorithm is proposed to discard the noise pulses or clutter. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated under the effects of noise and missing pulses. It has been observed that the PSBRS algorithm can cope with a large number of noise pulses and it is completely independent of missing pulses. Finally, PSBRS is compared with some benchmark algorithms, and the simulation results reveal the feasibility and efficiency of the algorithm.","doi":"10.21629/JSEE.2017.04.08","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/8038194/08038205.pdf","startPage":"690","endPage":"696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.21629/JSEE.2017.04.08","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sorting radar signal from symmetry clustering perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Sorting radar signal from symmetry clustering perspective","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038205/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17561651","volume":"28","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Sorting radar signal from symmetry clustering perspective","sourcePdf":"690696.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024027S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","isNumber":"8038194","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"4","articleId":"8038205","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038206,"authors":[{"name":"Youssef Fayad","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Youssef","lastName":"Fayad"},{"name":"Caiyun Wang","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Caiyun","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Qunsheng Cao","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Qunsheng","lastName":"Cao"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1004-4132"}],"articleNumber":"8038206","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information (BIAI)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Planar arrays","Phased arrays","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved TS-ESPRIT","temporal-spatial subspaces modern combination method","MIMO radar","time difference of arrival technique","planar array","2D-direction of arrival estimation","2D-DOA estimation","multi-input and multi-output radar","unified phase shifts measurement point","parallelly temporal processing","computational time","spatial processing","measurement point","common reference point","multiple uniform sub-planar arrays","rotational invariance techniques method","signal parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["direction of arrival estimation (DOAE)","temporal sub-space","spatial subspace","estimating signal parameters via rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038206","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/8038194/08038206.pdf","startPage":"697","endPage":"702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.21629/JSEE.2017.04.09","doi":"10.21629/JSEE.2017.04.09","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038194","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal-spatial subspaces modern combination method for 2D-DOA estimation in MIMO radar","abstract":"A 2D-direction of arrival estimation (DOAE) for multiinput and multi-output (MIMO) radar using improved multiple temporal-spatial subspaces in estimating signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques method (TS-ESPRIT) is introduced.

Therefore, a multi-objective reentry trajectory optimization (MORTO) approach via generalized varying domain (GVD) is proposed. Using the direct collocation approach, the trajectory optimization problem involving multiple objectives is discretized into a nonlinear multi-objective programming with priorities. In terms of fuzzy sets, the objectives are fuzzified into three types of fuzzy goals, and their constant tolerances are substituted by the varying domains. According to the principle that the objective with higher priority has higher satisfactory degree, the priority requirement is modeled as the order constraints of the varying domains. The corresponding two-side, single-side, and hybrid-side varying domain models are formulated for three fuzzy relations respectively. By regulating the parameter, the optimal reentry trajectory satisfying priorities can be achieved. Moreover, the performance about the parameter is analyzed, and the algorithm to find its specific value for maximum priority difference is proposed.

Motivated by the input-output linearization of the normal affine nonlinear system, a global diffeomorphism map is designed under the assumption that the singular nonlinear system has a strong relative degree.

Attaching an internal model to the new singular nonlinear system yields an augmented singular nonlinear system and the global robust stabilization solution of the augmented system implies the global robust output regulation solution of the original singular nonlinear system. Then the global stabilization problem is solved by some appropriate assumptions and the solvability conditions of the global robust output regulation problem are established. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the design approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038211/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","volume":"28","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"17561656","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Global robust output regulation for a class of affine singular nonlinear systems","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Global robust output regulation for a class of affine singular nonlinear systems","sourcePdf":"745755.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023432S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","isNumber":"8038194","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","articleId":"8038211","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038212,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolei Li","affiliation":["Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, Hebei, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaolei","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Xiaoyuan Luo","affiliation":["Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, Hebei, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaoyuan","lastName":"Luo"},{"name":"Shaobao Li","affiliation":["Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, Hebei, CN"],"firstName":"Shaobao","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Jianjin Li","affiliation":["Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, Hebei, CN"],"firstName":"Jianjin","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Xinping Guan","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Xinping","lastName":"Guan"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1004-4132"}],"articleNumber":"8038212","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information (BIAI)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Multi-agent systems","Topology","Robustness","Convergence","Graph theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","distributed control","multi-agent systems","nonlinear control systems","observers","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sliding mode control approach","distributed discontinuous control law","first-order SMC","consensus problem","second-order nonlinear multiagent systems","sliding mode observer","MAS","chatting problem","boundary layer method","super-twisting algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["nonlinear multi-agent system","sliding mode observer","consensus","sliding mode controller"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the consensus problem of second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) via the sliding mode control (SMC) approach.

The length of warranty is prespecified and during the warranty period, the product is minimally repaired by the dealer when it fails. Following the expiration of the non-renewing warranty, the product is inspected and upgraded sequentially a fixed number of times at the expenses of the customer. At each inspection, the failure rate of the product is reduced proportionally so that the product is upgraded. The product is assumed to deteriorate as it ages and the replacement of the product occurs when a fixed number of inspections are rendered. In addition, the intervals between two successive inspections are assumed to decrease monotonically. The main objective of this paper is to determine the optimal improvement level to upgrade the product at each inspection so that the expected maintenance cost during the life cycle of the product is minimized from the perspective of the customer. Under the given cost structures, we derive an explicit formula to obtain the expected maintenance cost incurred during the life cycle of the product and discuss the method to find the optimal level of the improvement analytically in case the failure times follow the Weibull distribution.

The structure of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) enabled testbed is shown. A custom FPGA implementation was made to have access to the full potential of the used SDR platform. Furthermore, the synchronization of multiple SDRs to enable MIMO operation is discussed. The ranging error and its variance are measured and discussed for a monostatic ranging enabled RFID reader, using two USRPs. The results are compared to a bistatic setup which uses one USRP only. The underlying ranging principle is successfully verified, and its practical performance limitations, resulting from multipath propagation, are shown.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Radio Frequency Identification","pdfPath":"/iel7/7433271/7499073/08038235.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"38","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Radio Frequency Identification","doi":"10.1109/JRFID.2017.2749200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRFID.2017.2749200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7499073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extension of an SDR UHF RFID Testbed for MIMO and Monostatic Time of Flight Based Ranging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distance measurement","Synchronization","Radiofrequency identification","MIMO","Field programmable gate arrays","RFID tags"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","MIMO communication","radiofrequency identification","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDR UHF RFID testbed","radio frequency identification tags","off-the-shelf EPC Class1 Gen2 tags","automated tag positioner","modified software defined radio platform","RFID reader","SDR platform","MIMO operation","monostatic ranging","flight based ranging method","ToF ranging method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radio frequency identification","RFID tags","distance measurement","ranging","localization","spread spectrum","field programmable gate arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Extension of an SDR UHF RFID Testbed for MIMO and Monostatic Time of Flight Based Ranging","volume":"1","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8038235/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"17541283","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) within the project REFlex","grantNumber":"845630"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extension of an SDR UHF RFID Testbed for MIMO and Monostatic Time of Flight Based Ranging","sourcePdf":"jrfid-galler-2749200-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049088S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7433271","isNumber":"7499073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7433271","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7499073","articleId":"8038235","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8038237,"authors":[{"name":"Xudong Kang","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8118236/8038237/kang-2743102-small.gif","p":["Xudong Kang (S\u201913\u2013M\u201915\u2013SM\u201917) received the B.Sc. degree from Northeast University, Shenyang, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2015.","In 2015, he joined the College of Electrical Engineering, Hunan University.

However, a direct use of the EPFs can be insufficient to provide a complete characterization of spatial information when objects of different scales are present in the considered images. Furthermore, the edge-preserving smoothing operation unavoidably decreases the spectral differences among objects of different classes, which may affect the following classification. To overcome these problems, in this paper, a novel principal component analysis (PCA)-based EPFs (PCA-EPFs) method for HSI classification is proposed, which consists of the following steps. First, the standard EPFs are constructed by applying edge-preserving filters with different parameter settings to the considered image, and the resulting EPFs are stacked together. Next, the spectral dimension of the stacked EPFs is reduced with the PCA, which not only can represent the EPFs in the mean square sense but also highlight the separability of pixels in the EPFs. Finally, the resulting PCA-EPFs are classified by a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Experiments performed on several real hyperspectral data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed PCA-EPFs, which sharply improves the accuracy of the SVM classifier with respect to the standard edge-preserving filtering-based feature extraction method, and other widely used spectral-spatial classifiers.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2017.2743102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8118236/08038237.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2743102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8118236","startPage":"7140","endPage":"7151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PCA-Based Edge-Preserving Features for Hyperspectral Image Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PCA-Based Edge-Preserving Features for Hyperspectral Image Classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17390131","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038237/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601179"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Fund of China for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"61325007"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Fund of China for International Cooperation and Exchanges","grantNumber":"61520106001"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Plan Projects Fund of Hunan Province","grantNumber":"2015WK3001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PCA-Based Edge-Preserving Features for Hyperspectral Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-li-2743102-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117679S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8118236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"8118236","articleId":"8038237","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8038246,"authors":[{"name":"Prathamesh H.

The architecture is based on the recently proposed LMBA technique, in which a control signal applied at the output isolation port of a balanced amplifier is used to modulate the apparent load impedance of the two devices comprising the balanced amplifier. In our approach, the injected control signal is used both as an active match and to dynamically load modulate the main devices to provide efficiency enhancement at back-off, thus extending the dynamic range compared to the original LMBA formulation. In this paper, we introduce a phase-compensation technique through which the active matching and load modulation tracks the frequency-dependent optimal loading trajectory of a packaged device. The result is a load-modulation power amplifier architecture able to perform an active, modulated match over an octave bandwidth. The technique is demonstrated over 1.8-3.8 GHz using packaged devices and an off-the-shelf hybrid coupler. The proof-of-concept octave RF-input LMBA has a peak CW output power of 44 dBm, with power added efficiency (PAE) over the 1.8-3.8 GHz operating frequency range of 37%-59% at peak power and 29%-45% at 6-dB output backoff. The RF-input nature of this architecture enables straightforward measurement with modulated signals; a W-CDMA signal at 3.8 GHz with 9-dB (measured) peak to average power ratio is demonstrated with adjacent channel leakage ratio of -30 dBc and average PAE of 18% for a 31-dBm average output power (2-dB backoff).","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2017.2748123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8187763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2017.2748123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8187763/08038246.pdf","startPage":"5181","endPage":"5191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RF-Input Load Modulated Balanced Amplifier With Octave Bandwidth","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"RF-Input Load Modulated Balanced Amplifier With Octave Bandwidth","volume":"65","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8038246/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17466500","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038246/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100002186","fundingName":"Lockheed Martin","grantNumber":"410673517.02.01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF-Input Load Modulated Balanced Amplifier With Octave Bandwidth","sourcePdf":"tmtt-pednekar-2748123-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070771S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8187763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"8187763","articleId":"8038246","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038248,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Liang","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Automatic Information Systems, College of Computer and Control Engineering, and the Tianjin Key Laboratory of Intelligent Robotics, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8248572/8038248/liang-2752139-small.gif","p":["Xiao Liang (S\u201917) received the B.S. degree in intelligence\n science and technology from Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China, in 2013.

During the transferring process, it is very challenging to eliminate the swing, since there is no direct control on the payload. The quadrotor transportation system presents the great challenge of the cascaded underactuated-underactuated property, which makes it extremely difficult to simultaneously implement accurate quadrotor positioning and efficient payload swing suppression. In this paper, a nonlinear hierarchical control scheme is proposed for a quadrotor transportation system, which takes full advantage of the cascade property of the system and separates the controller design for the inner loop and the outer loop, respectively, to facilitate the design procedure. More specifically, for the outer loop subsystem, based on the proposed energy storage function, a virtual control vector is designed, which introduces a saturation function to make the desired attitude free of any singularities. For the inner loop, a coordinate-free geometric attitude tracking controller is designed on the Lie group to drive the quadrotor to its desired attitude. It is shown theoretically by Lyapunov techniques and LaSalle's invariance theorem that the equilibrium point of the overall system is asymptotically stable. As illustrated by experimental results, the proposed control law presents advantages such as high control precision, effective payload swing suppression, and so on.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8248572/08038248.pdf","startPage":"3395","endPage":"3405","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2752139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2752139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8248572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Hierarchical Control for Unmanned Quadrotor Transportation Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Payloads","Transportation","Attitude control","Tracking loops","Stability analysis","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","asymptotic stability","attitude control","autonomous aerial vehicles","cascade systems","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","feedback","helicopters","Lie groups","Lyapunov methods","motion control","nonlinear control systems","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerial transferring tasks","transferring process","direct control","cascaded underactuated-underactuated property","nonlinear hierarchical control scheme","cascade property","controller design","inner loop","design procedure","outer loop subsystem","virtual control vector","coordinate-free geometric attitude tracking controller","control law","high control precision","effective payload swing suppression","unmanned quadrotor transportation systems","complex environment","quadrotor positioning","payload swing suppression","outer loop","energy storage function","saturation function","Lie group","Lyapunov techniques","LaSalle invariance theorem","asymptotic stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cascade systems","hierarchical control","LaSalle's invariance theorem","unmanned quadrotor transportation systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Hierarchical Control for Unmanned Quadrotor Transportation Systems","volume":"65","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8038248/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17485589","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61325017"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006606","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin","grantNumber":"16JCZDJC30300"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Hierarchical Control for Unmanned Quadrotor Transportation Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-liang-2752139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13579S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8248572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"8248572","articleId":"8038248","onlineDate":"14 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":8038249,"authors":[{"name":"Dongshu Wang","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, Huaqiao University, Quanzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8417016/8038249/wang-2741349-small.gif","p":["Dongshu Wang received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Huaibei Normal University, Huaibei, China, in 2003, the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from Huaqiao University, Quanzhou, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2016.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Mathematical Science, Huaqiao University.

We propose an approach for automatic text summarization of large scale Arabic multiple documents using Genetic algorithm and MapReduce parallel programming model. The approach insures scalability, speed and accuracy in summary generation. It eliminates sentence redundancy and increases readability and cohesion factors between the sentences of summaries. The experiments resulted in acceptable precision and recall scores. This indicates that the system successfully identifies the most important sentences. In Addition to all to that, the approach provided up to 10x speedup score, which is faster than on a single machine. Therefore, it can deal with large-scale datasets successfully.

In this paper, We propose a nonlinear companding scheme called 'Absolute Exponential Companding' (AEXC) to reduced PAPR in FBMC/OQAM system. However, the FBMC/OQAM system is employed with prototype filter bank using square root raised cosine (SRRC) filter. The simulation results show that, The proposed schemes highly effectively reduces the PAPR in the system by compressing the peak signals and expanding the small signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Palestinian International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (PICICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038284/8038297/08038324.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"65","publicationTitle":"2017 Palestinian International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (PICICT)","doi":"10.1109/PICICT.2017.17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICICT.2017.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038297","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Absolute Exponential Companding to Reduced PAPR for FBMC/OQAM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Filter banks","Prototypes","Receivers","Transmitters","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","channel bank filters","next generation networks","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["absolute exponential companding","filter bank multicarrier","FBMC","offset quadrature amplitude modulation","OQAM","next generation wireless communication system","5G system","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","OFDM","multicarrier modulation system","peak to average power ratio","PAPR","reduced power efficiency","nonlinear companding scheme","square root raised cosine filter","SRRC filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FBMC/OQAM","PAPR","5G","MCM","Absolute exponential Companding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Absolute Exponential Companding to Reduced PAPR for FBMC/OQAM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8038324/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17175357","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","conferenceDate":"8-9 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Absolute Exponential Companding to Reduced PAPR for FBMC/OQAM","confLoc":"Gaza, Palestine","sourcePdf":"6538a060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06279S","chronDate":"8-9 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038284","isNumber":"8038297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038284","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8038297","articleId":"8038324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":8038325,"authors":[{"name":"Imad A.

It is challenging to perform spectrum decision for multimedia applications in cognitive radio networks(CRNs) due to two reasons. One is that QoE evaluation model for SU in CRNs is still an open issue, for the conventional QoE models neglecting the effects of primary users'(PUs') behavior. The other reason is the dynamic characteristics of available channel and competitions among SUs cause difficulty to satisfy heterogeneous SUs' QoE requirements. Therefore, firstly we develop a satisfaction probability-based QoE evaluation model for multimedia CRN taking specific metrics handoff delay and handoff frequency into account. Then, based on this model, we proposed a spectrum decision scheme to maximize the SUs' expectation of mean opinion score(MOS). The scheme adaptively achieve spectrum decision according to changing channel condition and SU traffic load.

A cognitive radio network (CRN) with multiple Secondary Users (SUs) may coexist with other wireless systems such as Small Cells (SC) and Radar systems, both Primary Users (PUs) with different level of priorities. Traditional spectrum sensing typically only gives information about the presence or absence of a PU. However, when multiple heterogeneous systems coexist, it becomes imperative to acquire the knowledge of the systems operating in a specific band at a particular time so as to choose an appropriate transmission strategy. In this work, we take advantage of the learning capability of a Neural Network Predictor (NNP) to obtain the statistics of the coexisted wireless systems from the RF traces collected in our Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) based test bed. The NNP is able to learn the features of the RF traces and make accurate prediction of the signals prevalent in the wireless environment. Because of the augmented information learned from the RF traces, a novel optimization problem incorporating the outputs from the NNP is formulated to maximize the throughput of the CRN. The solution is derived using Karush- Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) and extensive simulations using the real RF traces are carried out. It is demonstrated that the NNP can detect the type and number of coexisted users reliably and the proposed scheme will improve the performance of the coexisted CRN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038357/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17190923","publicationDate":"July 2017","conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038357/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Big RF Data Assisted Cognitive Radio Network Coexistence in 3.5GHz Band","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Big RF Data Assisted Cognitive Radio Network Coexistence in 3.5GHz Band","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1194366.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081184S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8038358,"authors":[{"name":"Sayantan Chowdhury","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Telecommunication, Jadavpur University, India"],"firstName":"Sayantan","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"37872246600"},{"name":"Jianping Pan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Pan","id":"37277290300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2991-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2992-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8038358","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038358","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Interference","Channel allocation","Sensors","Fading channels","Cognitive radio","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","channel assignment","joint utility stable matching approach","secondary user-channel pair","joint utility function","maximal secondary user utility","maximal channel utility","Gale-Shapley stable marriage algorithm","optimal transmission power","optimal channel bandwidth","computer simulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038358","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038358.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Assignment in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Joint Utility and Stable Matching Approach","abstract":"Channel assignment is a key problem in Cognitive Radio Networks.

In this paper, we first define two utility functions, one for the secondary user and another for the channel. Then, in the pre-matching stage, we find a trade-off between these two utilities for each secondary user-channel pair by defining a joint utility function. Next, using the maximal secondary user utility and the maximal channel utility corresponding to the trade-off point as a measure of their preference for each other, we match secondary users and channels to each other by the Gale-Shapley stable marriage algorithm.

A dense femtocell network provides an efficient and low cost solution to respond to high traffic demand. When a densely deployed femtocell network is underutilized during low traffic load this creates interference among registered and unregistered users. In this paper, a cluster-based sleep mode activation optimization method based on fade duration is proposed along with an algorithm for hybrid femtocell networks. The femtocell sleep mode initiation is based on fade duration outage probability (FDOP). The proposed method also considers distances between femtocell access points and resources taken as benchmarks for optimization of sleep mode activation. FDOP determines the probability that a fade will occur of a duration beyond which a connection is considered in an outage state. Since the proposed method is based on FDOP rather than SNR, it provides a much better prediction of user application performance. The results based on this proposed method show an improvement in power efficiency, interference mitigation, and resource utilization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fade Duration Based Sleep Mode Activation in Dense Femtocell Cluster Networks","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038359","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038359.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038359","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","displayDocTitle":"Fade Duration Based Sleep Mode Activation in Dense Femtocell Cluster Networks","conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8038359/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17190887","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fade Duration Based Sleep Mode Activation in Dense Femtocell Cluster Networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1195044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080812S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8038370,"authors":[{"name":"Amitangshu Pal","affiliation":["Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA"],"firstName":"Amitangshu","lastName":"Pal","id":"37393613200"},{"name":"Krishna Kant","affiliation":["Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA"],"firstName":"Krishna","lastName":"Kant","id":"37274931100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2991-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2992-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8038370","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038370","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internet","Servers","Logistics","Delays","Containers","Predictive models","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","data dissemination","data structures","Internet","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content centric networks","neighborhood aware caching-interest dissemination","NACID","next generation Internet architecture","ubiquitous in-network caching","content delivery latency","network traffic","neighborhood aware mechanism","content caching","Bloom filter based dissemination","caching information","neighborhood cached contents"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038370","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038370.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NACID: A Neighborhood Aware Caching and Interest Dissemination in Content Centric Networks","abstract":"Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a promising framework for the next generation Internet architecture, by exploiting ubiquitous in-network caching to minimize content delivery latency and reducing the network traffic.

Simulation results show that NACID provides an increase in up to ~3 times of cache hits, and decrease in up to ~30% the number of hops required to get the contents than existing CCN caching policies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038370/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17175375","publicationDate":"July 2017","conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038370/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"NACID: A Neighborhood Aware Caching and Interest Dissemination in Content Centric Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NACID: A Neighborhood Aware Caching and Interest Dissemination in Content Centric Networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1195056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068712S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8038371,"authors":[{"name":"Teng Wang","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA, US"],"firstName":"Teng","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Jiayin Wang","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA, US"],"firstName":"Jiayin","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Son Nam Nguyen","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA, US"],"firstName":"Son Nam","lastName":"Nguyen"},{"name":"Zhengyu Yang","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, US"],"firstName":"Zhengyu","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Ningfang Mi","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, US"],"firstName":"Ningfang","lastName":"Mi"},{"name":"Bo Sheng","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA, US"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Sheng"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2991-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2992-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8038371","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038371","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Job shop scheduling","Resource management","Yarn","Containers","Big Data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","cloud computing","parallel processing","pattern clustering","sampling methods","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EA2S2","application-aware storage system","big data processing","heterogeneous clusters","Hadoop","resource management","data locality","sampling-based randomized algorithm","network file system","NSF CloudLab platforms","large-scale clusters"]}],"abstract":"Big data processing frameworks such as Hadoop have been widely adopted to process a large volume of data. A lot of prior work has focused on the allocation of resources and the execution order of jobs/tasks to improve the performance in a homogeneous cluster. In this paper, we investigate storage layer design in a heterogeneous system considering a new type of bundled jobs where the input data and associated application jobs are submitted in a bundle. Our goal is to break the barrier between resource management and the underlying storage layer, and improve data locality, an important performance factor for resource management, from the aspect of storage system. We develop a sampling-based randomized algorithm for the network file system to determine the placement of input data blocks. The main idea is to query a selected set of candidate nodes, and estimate their workload at run time combining centralized and per-node information. The node with the smallest workload is selected to host the data block. Our evaluation is based with system implementation and comprehensive experiments on NSF CloudLab platforms. We have also conducted simulation for large-scale clusters. The results show significant performance improvements in terms of execution time and data locality.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038371","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038371.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EA2S2: An Efficient Application-Aware Storage System for Big Data Processing in Heterogeneous Clusters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","displayDocTitle":"EA2S2: An Efficient Application-Aware Storage System for Big Data Processing in Heterogeneous Clusters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17190862","htmlLink":"/document/8038371/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EA2S2: An Efficient Application-Aware Storage System for Big Data Processing in Heterogeneous Clusters","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1195070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122643S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8038375,"authors":[{"name":"Xueshi Hou","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Xueshi","lastName":"Hou","id":"37085793790"},{"name":"Yao Lu","affiliation":["Owlii Inc."],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086028897"},{"name":"Sujit Dey","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Sujit","lastName":"Dey","id":"37278573500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2991-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2992-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8038375","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1981},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resists","Rendering (computer graphics)","Cloud computing","Servers","Streaming media","Bit rate","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","helmet mounted displays","human computer interaction","mobile computing","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile device","truly portable VR experience","mobile VR experience","light weight VR glasses","wireless VR approach","display devices","Oculus Rift","HTC Vive","Samsung Gear VR","user experience","console","application scenarios","wireless VR-AR","HMD devices","edge-cloud computing devices","computer","head-mounted display devices","bitrate requirements","latency requirements"]}],"abstract":"Triggered by several head-mounted display (HMD) devices that have come to the market recently, such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Samsung Gear VR, significant interest has developed in virtual reality (VR) systems, experiences and applications.

Due to the increasing number of rules and the complex semantics of regular expressions, state-of-the-art regular expression matching techniques hardly meet the demands of network development. The rapid growth of parallel technology calls for an efficient parallel regular expression matching method. In this paper, we propose ParaRegex, a novel approach for fast parallel regular expression matching with high efficiency and low overhead. ParaRegex is a framework that implements data- parallel regular expression matching for finite automaton based methods. Experimental evaluation shows that ParaRegex produces a high-performance regular expression matching engine with low memory overhead and linear speed-up ratio, and obtains up to 6 times faster processing speed on a commodity multi-core workstation.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038377","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038377.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Parallelization of Regular Expression Matching for Deep Inspection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Parallelization of Regular Expression Matching for Deep Inspection","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038377/","conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17190892","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038377/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Parallelization of Regular Expression Matching for Deep Inspection","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1194314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074355S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8038381,"authors":[{"name":"Han Gao","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085830263"},{"name":"Zhengyu Yang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Zhengyu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086002199"},{"name":"Janki Bhimani","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Janki","lastName":"Bhimani","id":"37085710949"},{"name":"Teng Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Teng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086030484"},{"name":"Jiayin Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Jiayin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086132452"},{"name":"Bo Sheng","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37266459400"},{"name":"Ningfang Mi","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Ningfang","lastName":"Mi","id":"37603427400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2991-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2992-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8038381","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038381","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparks","Resource management","Big Data","Optimal scheduling","Job shop scheduling","Scheduling algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","parallel processing","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AutoPath","parallel execution paths","computing resource allocation","multistage big data frameworks","Hadoop","data-intensive processing","built-in scheduling algorithms","Spark v1.5.0","resource utilizations"]}],"abstract":"Due to the flexibility of data operations and scalability of in- memory cache, Spark has revealed the potential to become the standard distributed framework to replace Hadoop for data-intensive processing in both industry and academia. However, we observe that the built-in scheduling algorithms in Spark (i.e., FIFO and FAIR) are not optimized for the applications with multiple parallel and independent branches in stages. Specifically, the child stage needs to wait and collect data from all its parent branches, but this wait has no guaranteed upper bound since it is tightly coupled with each branch's workload characteristic, stage order, and their corresponding allocated computing resource. To address this challenge, we investigate a superior solution which ensures all branches acquire suitable resources according to their workload demand in order to let the finish time of each branch be as close as possible. Based on this, we propose a novel scheduling policy, named AutoPath, which can effectively reduce the overall makespan of such kind of applications by detecting and leveraging the parallel path, and adaptively assigning computing resources based on the estimated workload demands during runtime. We implemented the new scheduling scheme in Spark v1.5.0 and evaluated it with selected representative workloads. The experiments demonstrate that our new scheduler effectively reduces the makespan and improves resource utilizations for these applications, compared to the current FIFO and FAIR schedulers.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038381","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038381.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AutoPath: Harnessing Parallel Execution Paths for Efficient Resource Allocation in Multi-Stage Big Data Frameworks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","displayDocTitle":"AutoPath: Harnessing Parallel Execution Paths for Efficient Resource Allocation in Multi-Stage Big Data Frameworks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17190845","htmlLink":"/document/8038381/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AutoPath: Harnessing Parallel Execution Paths for Efficient Resource Allocation in Multi-Stage Big Data Frameworks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1194560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116976S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038393,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyuan Zheng","affiliation":["Texas A & M University, TX"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37086096505"},{"name":"A.L.

BACnet is a standard data communication protocol designed to operate across many types of BAS field panels and controllers. This paper studies BACnet traffic in a real-world BAS from various vantage points and develops an anomaly detector for BAS networks. Our analysis of BACnet traffic through several measures reveals that BACnet traffic is neither strictly periodic as expected of control traffic nor exhibits diurnal patterns of IP network traffic. BACnet traffic is a combination of multiple flow-service streams that belong to \"THE-driven'\" categories: Time-driven, Human-driven, and Event-driven. Time-driven traffic follows periodic patterns, regular patterns, or on/off models. Human-driven and event- driven traffic present non-periodic patterns. We construct flow-service models for time-driven traffic and develop THE-Driven Anomaly Detector which adopts different mechanisms for each category of traffic. We evaluate the anomaly detector using k-fold cross validation and synthetic attacks. The proposed THE-Driven Anomaly Detector is shown to be able to effectively detect suspicious traffic in BAS networks with small false alarm rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038393.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Safeguarding Building Automation Networks: THE-Driven Anomaly Detector Based on Traffic Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Protocols","Servers","IP networks","Security","Building automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["building management systems","computer network security","control engineering computing","HVAC","IP networks","protocols","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detector","traffic analysis","Building Automation Systems","standard data communication protocol","BAS networks","control traffic","IP network traffic","periodic patterns","nonperiodic patterns","time-driven traffic","suspicious traffic","building Automation networks","heating ventilation and air-conditioning","smart buildings security","BACnet traffic","THE-driven categories","human-driven traffic","flow-service models","k-fold cross validation","synthetic attacks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","displayDocTitle":"Safeguarding Building Automation Networks: THE-Driven Anomaly Detector Based on Traffic Analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8038393/","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17190973","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Safeguarding Building Automation Networks: THE-Driven Anomaly Detector Based on Traffic Analysis","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1194816.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134875S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8038424,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroaki Yamanaka","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Yamanaka","id":"38512226100"},{"name":"Eiji Kawai","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Eiji","lastName":"Kawai","id":"37274141600"},{"name":"Yuuichi Teranishi","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuuichi","lastName":"Teranishi","id":"37318322100"},{"name":"Hiroaki Harai","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Harai","id":"37281575700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2991-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2992-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8038424","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038424","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Base stations","Wireless communication","Edge computing","Computer architecture","Cloud computing","Urban areas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proximity-aware IaaS","edge computing environment","low-latency responses","infrastructure-as-a-service","EC-IaaS","application service providers","virtualized resource","virtual machines","edge server locations","wireless base stations","latency information"]}],"abstract":"Edge computing enables application services to leverage low-latency responses, e.g., for augmented reality. Infrastructure-as-a-service for edge computing (EC-IaaS) allows multiple application service providers (ASPs) to use a virtualized resource (i.e., virtual machines (VMs) and virtual networks) for various applications services on the common edge computing infrastructure. For ASPs, the proximity of the VMs to the end-user devices (i.e., the location of the host edge servers) is a significant factor in guaranteeing low-latency response times. The existing method allows ASPs to select the edge server locations so that the VMs satisfy the proximity requirement. However, the amount of information transmitted from the EC-IaaS provider to the ASP becomes large, because it has to include the latencies between all edge server locations and all wireless base stations. We propose a method that reduces the amount of information while ensuring that ASPs obtain VMs that satisfy the proximity requirement. An EC-IaaS provider suggests groups of wireless base stations that have VMs within a suitable proximity, which helps the ASPs to estimate the necessary number of VMs. Instead of the ASP, the EC-IaaS provider determines which edge servers should contain the VMs. We confirm that the proposed method reduces the transmitted information. The EC-IaaS provider also has a benefit that detail latency information is kept closed to ASPs and the power draw is sustained compared to the existing method.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038424","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038424.pdf","startPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proximity-Aware IaaS for Edge Computing Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038424/","displayDocTitle":"Proximity-Aware IaaS for Edge Computing Environment","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17190873","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038424/","publicationDate":"July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proximity-Aware IaaS for Edge Computing Environment","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1194922.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8038428,"authors":[{"name":"Danda B.

In this paper, we study the creation of virtual wireless networks through wireless virtualization for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) where portion of the primary bandwidth is sliced and leased to the MVNOs. For wireless virtualization, owners of wireless infrastructures in HetNets divide and reconfigure their RF bands to sublease to MVNOs based on their service-level-agreements while keeping enough wireless resources to their own users. Next, we leverage the wireless virtualization to investigate the network sum-capacity and revenue maximization problems for MVNOs where MVNOs offer competitive prices to attract more users for wireless communications. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using different metrics such as network sum-capacity, revenue of the MVNOs, competitive price for RF spectrum usage that is based on the spectral capacity of the MVNOs, and the outage probability. Numerical results obtained from simulations show that the sum-capacity of virtual network can be maximized while maximizing their revenue and offering lower/competitive spectrum-usage price for their users.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging Wireless Virtualization for Network Capacity Optimization in HetNets","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038428","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038428.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging Wireless Virtualization for Network Capacity Optimization in HetNets","conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8038428/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17190946","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging Wireless Virtualization for Network Capacity Optimization in HetNets","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1194656.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056498S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8038444,"authors":[{"name":"Ken Goss","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Missouri University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Goss","id":"37086100020"},{"name":"Riccardo Musmeci","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Missouri University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Musmeci","id":"37086101062"},{"name":"Simone Silvestri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Missouri University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Silvestri","id":"37411501600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2991-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2992-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8038444","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Payloads","Power demand","Mathematical model","Predictive models","Optimization","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","optimisation","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real test-bed","3DR Solo UAV","mechanical hardware aspects","optimization algorithms","flight time","mission planners","critical performance characteristics","civilian applications","military applications","unmanned aerial vehicles","realistic models","basic UAV operations","electrical hardware aspects","physical hardware aspects"]}],"abstract":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being adopted for military and civilian applications. UAVs available on the market are well known to be resource constrained, especially in terms of available energy. As a result, it is very challenging to predict the critical performance characteristics of a UAV, such as flight time or the ability of a UAV to complete a mission, given the system parameters. Nevertheless, such predictions would have several benefits, such as improving the effectiveness of mission planners and optimization algorithms in general, as well as enabling researchers to perform more realistic simulations. The goal of this paper is to gain understanding in how physical, mechanical, or electrical hardware aspects of a UAV affect the UAV performance and ultimately its capability to accomplish a mission. We propose two models for UAV performance. The first model considers basic UAV operations, while the second model considers the UAV physical characteristics as well as the mission specifications to predict the UAV flight time and the number of waypoints it can safely traverse. We validate our models thorough experiments using a real test-bed based on 3DR Solo UAVs. The results show that our approach is able to reliably predict performance to within less than 5\\% margin of error.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realistic Models for Characterizing the Performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038444","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038444.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","displayDocTitle":"Realistic Models for Characterizing the Performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8038444/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17204414","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realistic Models for Characterizing the Performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1194804.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070878S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8038450,"authors":[{"name":"Zainul Din","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA"],"firstName":"Zainul","lastName":"Din","id":"38256992900"},{"name":"Jaudelice de Oliveira","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA"],"firstName":"Jaudelice","lastName":"de Oliveira","id":"37274671000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2991-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2992-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8038450","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","IP networks","Protocols","Correlation","Ports (Computers)","Neural networks","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["firewalls","formal logic","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","software defined networking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly free","policy composition","software defined networks","machine learning","application-aware software defined firewalling","propositional logic","artificial neural networks","hidden Markov models"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we extend our prior work on efficient policy composition for Software Defined Networks and propose a machine learning based framework for anomaly free, on demand, application-aware software defined firewalling.

With frequency division duplex (FDD) being the prominent mode of operation, addressing the challenges for massive MIMO systems in FDD is extremely important. One such challenge is the downlink channel estimation, which should be accomplished with minimal pilot overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a compressive sensing (CS) algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

One of the main challenges in realizing NFV has to do with orchestration of virtual functions deployed in various locations across the network. In this work, we consider the service-concatenation routing problem, where the objective is to construct a path of minimum cost that visits a set of nodes where virtual services are to be applied to the user's traffic in a specific order. We first show that this problem can be modeled as the shortest path tour problem (SPTP) that has been studied in different contexts. We then review and implement a suite of algorithms that use a variety of solution approaches for tackling SPTP, and we also develop a new algorithm. Finally, we carry out a comprehensive experimental evaluation of all algorithms and demonstrate that our algorithm scales well to large problem instances and is suitable for real-time operation as part of the orchestration process in NFV environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Service-Concatenation Routing with Applications to Network Functions Virtualization","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038463","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038463.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","displayDocTitle":"Service-Concatenation Routing with Applications to Network Functions Virtualization","conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8038463/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17190914","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service-Concatenation Routing with Applications to Network Functions Virtualization","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1194672.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091847S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8038465,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel Dodge","affiliation":["Arizona State University"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Dodge","id":"37085818608"},{"name":"Lina Karam","affiliation":["Arizona State University"],"firstName":"Lina","lastName":"Karam","id":"37283437100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2991-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2992-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8038465","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":965},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study and Comparison of Human and Deep Learning Recognition Performance under Visual Distortions","abstract":"Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve excellent performance on standard classification tasks.

We additionally find that there is little correlation in errors between DNNs and human subjects. This could be an indication that the internal representation of images are different between DNNs and the human visual system.

The rate of degradation for a flash memory is largely affected by the amount and frequency of the erase/write operations, which is a challenge in the DC context that serves dynamically changing workloads. Adaptive Error Correction Code (AECC) schemes have been introduced for changing the error correction algorithm based on the reliability state of the flash. In this study we show that hard decision (bit-flipping) and soft decision decoding (Belief Propagation) class of algorithms for Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) decoders complement each other for utilizing in the flash based DCs in order to meet the dynamically changing reliability level. We propose a new family of ECC to improve the reliability of flash memory. Our Monte-Carlo simulations and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based hardware implementation analysis show that LDPC decoders are suitable for balancing the throughput, decoding performance and reliability requirements in DCs.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038467","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038467.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Mode Low-Latency Software-Defined Error Correction for Data Centers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Mode Low-Latency Software-Defined Error Correction for Data Centers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038467/","publicationDate":"July 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17190849","htmlLink":"/document/8038467/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Mode Low-Latency Software-Defined Error Correction for Data Centers","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1194872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111219S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8038483,"authors":[{"name":"Aitizaz Uddin Syed","affiliation":["Simon Fraser University Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"],"firstName":"Aitizaz Uddin","lastName":"Syed","id":"37085548944"},{"name":"Mohsin Iftikhar","affiliation":["Charles Strut University Wagga, Wagga, Australia"],"firstName":"Mohsin","lastName":"Iftikhar","id":"37086057501"},{"name":"Ljiljana Trajkovic","affiliation":["Simon Fraser University Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"],"firstName":"Ljiljana","lastName":"Trajkovic","id":"37371674500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2991-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2992-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8038483","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","MIMO","Wireless LAN","Algorithm design and analysis","Standards","Physical layer","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","MIMO communication","protocols","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal PPDU duration algorithm","VHT MU-MIMO systems","optimal physical layer convergence procedure protocol data unit","very high throughput group","wireless local area network","WLAN","multiuser multiple input multiple output protocols","MU-MIMO protocols","additional STAs","space-time streams"]}],"abstract":"We propose an optimal Physical Layer Convergence Procedure Protocol Data Unit (PPDU) duration algorithm that divides a long data stream into two portions among consecutive groups based on the average PPDU duration of the Very High Throughput (VHT) group.

These networks allow UAVs to cooperate more efficiently in an ad hoc manner in order to achieve specific tasks in specific environments. To do so, each drone navigates autonomously while staying connected with other nodes in its group via radio links. This connectivity can deliberately be maintained for a while constraining the mobility of the drones. This will be suitable for the drones involved in a given path of a given transmission between a source and a destination. This constraint could be removed at the end of the transmission process and the mobility of each concerned drone becomes again independent from the others. In this work, we have proposed a bio-inspired routing protocol for UAVs called BR- AODV. The protocol takes advantage of a well known ad hoc routing protocol for on-demand route computation, and the Boids of Reynolds mechanism for connectivity and route maintaining while data is being transmitted. The performances of BR-AODV were evaluated and compared to those of classical AODV routing protocol and the results show that BR-AODV outperforms AODV in terms of delay, throughput and packet loss.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038487","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038487.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-Inspired on Demand Routing Protocol for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038487/","displayDocTitle":"Bio-Inspired on Demand Routing Protocol for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17190971","htmlLink":"/document/8038487/","conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-Inspired on Demand Routing Protocol for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1195008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057978S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8038495,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086129883"},{"name":"Yu-Jung Chu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon"],"firstName":"Yu-Jung","lastName":"Chu","id":"37085667432"},{"name":"Thinh Nguyen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon"],"firstName":"Thinh","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37293066800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2991-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2992-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8038495","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless fidelity","Optical transmitters","Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio","Ultrafast optics","Light emitting diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","free-space optical communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coverage algorithms","WiFO","hybrid FSO-WiFi femtocell communication system","free space optical technologies","line of sight transmissions","Gaussian attenuation model","finite rectangle area"]}],"abstract":"We study coverage algorithms for deployment of WiFO - a hybrid femtocell architecture based on WiFi and Free Space Optical (FSO) technologies to significantly increase wireless throughput of existing WiFi networks. In contrast with existing WiFi networks, WiFO incorporates small cell size, line of sight transmissions, and the Gaussian attenuation model of light intensity into the design of the coverage algorithms. Specifically, two types of coverage scenarios - the non- overlapped and the overlapped coverage are presented. For the non-overlapped coverage, we show the bounds of coverage efficiency for a finite rectangle area based on a simple model. For the overlapped coverage, user's SNR profiles are assumed to be given. Using these, three algorithms for determining the optimized deployment based on user's SNR profiles and Gaussian light attenuation models are proposed and evaluated. Simulations results are provided to verify the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038495","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038495.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coverage Algorithms for WiFO: A Hybrid FSO-WiFi Femtocell Communication System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coverage Algorithms for WiFO: A Hybrid FSO-WiFi Femtocell Communication System","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038495/","conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17175364","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038495/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coverage Algorithms for WiFO: A Hybrid FSO-WiFi Femtocell Communication System","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1194914.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047857S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8038501,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangmin Yu","affiliation":["218 MSCS, OSU, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Jiangmin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086432633"},{"name":"Michael Farcasin","affiliation":["Oklahoma State University"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Farcasin","id":"37086047820"},{"name":"Eric Chan-Tin","affiliation":["Oklahoma State University"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Chan-Tin","id":"38308616400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2991-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2992-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8038501","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prediction algorithms","Hidden Markov models","White spaces","Wireless sensor networks","ZigBee","Wireless communication","Wireless fidelity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","health care","hidden Markov models","interference (signal)","low-power electronics","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless interference prediction","embedded health care devices","low-power sensors","ZigBee wireless signals","Wi-Fi-enabled device","sensor data loss","hidden Markov model","Wi-Fi interference"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038501","abstract":"Embedded healthcare devices are becoming increasingly popular. A device could use a low-power sensor to send data. These low-power sensors typically use ZigBee wireless signals; however, these signals are easily masked by stronger WiFi signals. If a sensor is sending data at the same time as a WiFi-enabled device, the sensor data is lost and needs to be retransmitted. This causes a loss in efficiency and energy usage of the sensor. We proposed two algorithms, based on a Hidden Markov Model and concordance, that are able to predict when a WiFi interference will occur, which ensures with high accuracy that the ZigBee sensor can send data without any risk of wireless interference. Concordance is based on the premise that past history repeats itself. Our experimental results are based on real datasets. Our Hidden Markov Model has a prediction accuracy rate of over 78% and our concordance algorithm has a prediction accuracy rate of over 70%. Our algorithms can also predict longer periods of time and achieve a higher prediction accuracy than current algorithms. Our concordance algorithm has a very low processing overhead, taking microseconds to make a prediction. The throughput improvement gain of our proposed algorithms over current algorithms is a factor of 2.5.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038501","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038501.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Interference Prediction for Embedded Health Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Interference Prediction for Embedded Health Devices","conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8038501/","accessionNumber":"17190904","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038501/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Interference Prediction for Embedded Health Devices","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1194640.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060089S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8038517,"authors":[{"name":"Suporn Pongnumkul","affiliation":["National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Thailand"],"firstName":"Suporn","lastName":"Pongnumkul","id":"37071284100"},{"name":"Chaiyaphum Siripanpornchana","affiliation":["National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chaiyaphum","lastName":"Siripanpornchana","id":"37085716646"},{"name":"Suttipong Thajchayapong","affiliation":["National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Thailand"],"firstName":"Suttipong","lastName":"Thajchayapong","id":"37424200000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2991-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2992-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8038517","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":5129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fabrics","Throughput","Contracts","Bitcoin","Software","Performance analysis","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","distributed processing","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","private blockchain platforms","varying workloads","hyperledger fabric","ethereum","private deployment","data management technology","Internet","IT systems","database systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038517","abstract":"This paper conducts a performance analysis of two popular private blockchain platforms, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum (private deployment), to assess the performance and limitations of these state-of-the-art platforms. Blockchain, a decentralized transaction and data management technology, is said to be the technology that will have similar impacts as the Internet had on people's lives. Many industries have become interested in adopting blockchain in their IT systems, but scalability is an often- cited concern of current blockchain technology. Therefore, the goals of this preliminary performance analysis are twofold. First, a methodology for evaluating a blockchain platform is developed. Second, the analysis results are presented to inform practitioners in making decisions regarding adoption of blockchain technology in their IT systems. The experimental results, based on varying number of transactions, show that Hyperledger Fabric consistently outperforms Ethereum across all evaluation metrics which are execution time, latency and throughput. Additionally, both platforms are still not competitive with current database systems in term of performances in high workload scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038517","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038517.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Private Blockchain Platforms in Varying Workloads","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Private Blockchain Platforms in Varying Workloads","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17190850","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038517/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038517/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Private Blockchain Platforms in Varying Workloads","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1194416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071322S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038518,"authors":[{"name":"Jagdeep Sidhu","affiliation":["Syscoin Core Developer Blockchain Foundry Inc."],"firstName":"Jagdeep","lastName":"Sidhu","id":"37086083686"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2991-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2992-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8038518","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1479},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038518","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Contracts","Bitcoin","Public key","Software","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic money","financial data processing","peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peer-to-peer electronic cash system","blockchain-based services","Syscoin","e-business","commercial-grade services","blockchain-based decentralized marketplace","secure data storage"]}],"abstract":"While Bitcoin (Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash) [Nak]solved the double spend problem and provided work withtimestamps on a public ledger, it has not to date extendedthe functionality of a blockchain beyond a transparent andpublic payment system.

Chancheng District, part of Foshan City in Guangdong Province, China, has undertaken a project called \"The Comprehensive Experimental Area of Big Data in Guangdong Province\" since 2016. Promoting the application of blockchain technology in e-government is an essential part of this undertaking, which is the first use of blockchain in government in China. Taking Chancheng's project as a case study, this article analyzes the framework, difficulties and challenges of applying blockchain to e-government at present, and discusses how blockchain technology can contribute to the development of e-government and public services in China. This article considers the practical realities in China and discusses the application of blockchain technology in Chinese e-government, finding that blockchain technology can bring the following benefits: (1) improvements in the quality and quantity of government services, (2) greater transparency and accessibility of government information, (3) development of information-sharing across different organizations, and (4) assistance in building an individual credit system in China. However, information security, cost and reliability are still major problems in application. Thus, establishing a general application platform of blockchain technology and developing management standards are crucial for promoting and applying blockchain in e-government. Blockchain provides an effective way of making government services more efficient, but standardizing the management system, processes and responsibility for the application is necessary for its further promotion. This article, by providing an analysis of the practice of blockchain in e-government in China, could serve as a foundation for further practical work and theoretical research in government services.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038519","publicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038519.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Application of Blockchain Technology in E-Government in China","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Application of Blockchain Technology in E-Government in China","conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17190842","htmlLink":"/document/8038519/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Application of Blockchain Technology in E-Government in China","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1194892.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044436S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038525,"authors":[{"name":"Rahmira Rufus","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, NC A&T State University, Greensboro, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Rahmira","lastName":"Rufus","id":"37085856652"},{"name":"Albert Esterline","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, NC A&T State University, Greensboro, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Esterline","id":"37392338900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2991-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2992-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8038525","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concatenating Unprotected Internet of Things Network Event-Driven Data to Obtain End-User Information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Security","Protocols","Internet of Things","Smart devices","Telemetry","Microcontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","Internet of Things","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["end-user information","Network Event-Driven Data","Internet of Things","unprotected Internet","raw data capture","smart device","end-user data services usage","device network usage","IoT constructs","threat mitigation techniques","IoT network","threat analysis","IoT devices","low-level processing operation","malicious entities"]}],"abstract":"This research demonstrates how to monitor an Internet of Things (IoT) construct and use the data captured from the network's IoT devices to gather information about end-users in the operating environment.

The formulated problem is a non-convex optimization problem and does not have a structure to guarantee the quality of a solution. We present the transformation of this problem to an equivalent optimization problem for which the monotonic optimization methods can be applied. We establish that the polyblock outer approximation algorithm for this monotonic optimization terminates with an \u03b5-optimal solution after a finite number of iterations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038338","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038296/8038338/08038531.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monotonic Optimization for Power Assignment in Two-Way Cognitive Radio Networks with Shared-Band Amplify-and-Forward Relays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038531/","displayDocTitle":"Monotonic Optimization for Power Assignment in Two-Way Cognitive Radio Networks with Shared-Band Amplify-and-Forward Relays","conferenceDate":"31 July-3 Aug. 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17175367","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monotonic Optimization for Power Assignment in Two-Way Cognitive Radio Networks with Shared-Band Amplify-and-Forward Relays","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1194980.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045156S","chronDate":"July 31 2017-Aug. 3 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8038296","isNumber":"8038338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038296","xplore-issue":"8038338","articleId":"8038531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8038674,"authors":[{"name":"Liquan Zhao","affiliation":["College of information Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin City, China"],"firstName":"Liquan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086021362"},{"name":"Yulong Liu","affiliation":["College of information Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin City, China"],"firstName":"Yulong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086018530"},{"name":"Lin Wang","affiliation":["Telecommunication Branch, Jilin Power Supply Company, Jilin City, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086021648"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3306-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3305-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3304-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3307-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8038674","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Image coding","Power transmission lines","Compressed sensing","Monitoring","Transmission line matrix methods","Matching pursuit algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","condition monitoring","data compression","image coding","image reconstruction","iterative methods","mobile communication","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image compression","data transmission","compressed sensing technology","image reconstruction","transmission line monitoring images","transmission line condition monitoring","sparse random matrix","mobile communication network","orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","image quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image compression","image reconstruction","compressed sensing","generalized orthogonal matching pursuit"]}],"abstract":"In order to ensure safely and effective operation of the transmission line, the condition monitoring of transmission lines is widely applied to discover the dangerous points of transmission lines and monitor surrounding weather conditions.

The operation cost is directly proportional to whose flow for data transmission. In order to reduce the operation cost, the compressed sensing technology is applied to image compression and image reconstruction in this paper. The proposed method uses sparse random matrix to sample transmission lines images on sensing nodes.

It addressed a distributed and online pure pursuit law as a reference plant coupled with control parameters which act in the formation keeping and gathering maneuvers. In hierarchical strategy, some agile and time-independent trajectories define the maneuvers, so it produces virtual points in leader coordinate system to make the wingman following. The path assigned to each follower is determined by priority as well as hierarchical planning. This framework creates a priority tracking system in an inherent collision avoidance pattern.

Then, while the measured energy is less than the threshold, the secondary user (SU) is allowed to transmit over primary user's (PU) band and otherwise, no secondary transmission occurs. Here, we show that the aforementioned conventional transmission strategy is suboptimal in terms of secondary achievable data rates and probability of detection. As an alternative, we propose a different approach to CR signaling based on a spectrum access function that defines an efficient framework for the SU to access the primary spectrum. In particular, we consider the scenario of PU emulation attack (PUEA) in CR where some malicious users mimic the PU's signal, leading to a reduction of the secondary achievable data rates. By considering PUEA into account, we derive the optimal spectrum access function by maximizing the secondary transmission data rate under miss detection and false alarm constraints, which insures that the CR user does not degrade the performance of the PU. Comparative numerical results illustrate the superiority and the adequacy of the proposed transmission scheme under PUEA in terms of higher secondary achievable data rate and higher probability of detection.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2017.2747594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8543256","startPage":"3767","endPage":"3774","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/8543256/08038762.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Transmission Strategy for Cognitive Radio Systems Under Primary User Emulation Attack","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038762/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038762/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Transmission Strategy for Cognitive Radio Systems Under Primary User Emulation Attack","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18272027","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Transmission Strategy for Cognitive Radio Systems Under Primary User Emulation Attack","sourcePdf":"jsyst-sadough-2747594-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124298S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8543256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8543256","articleId":"8038762","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8038763,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Optoelectronics, College of Electronic Science and Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"bio":{"p":["Lei Wang received the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics from the College of Electronic Science and Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2015.

Herein, based on the degree of laser induced free-carrier excitation, the formation of deep-subwavelength structures by fs-laser ablation was systematically studied on popular materials: negative tone resists SU8 and conductive polymer poly-3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene: poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS). A weak propensity to form deep-subwavelength structures was found on poly-methylmethacrylate and polyvinyl alcohol. The photo-excited electrons forming the surface plasmonic wave contributed to energy localization and absorption, which led to the imprinting of deep-subwavelength structures on polymers. It has been found that materials with \u03c0-bonds and benzene rings were most susceptible to deep-subwavelength structure formation.

However, a greater synergy between the two would make the relationship mutual, since the insights provided by the massive amount of data gathered by sensors can be exploited to improve the communication performance. In this paper, we concentrate on self-organization techniques to improve handover efficiency using vehicular traffic data gathered in London. Our algorithms exploit mobility patterns between cell coverage areas and road traffic congestion levels to optimize the handover bias in heterogeneous networks and dynamically manage mobility management entity (MME) loads to reduce handover completion times.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2752761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8334665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2752761","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8334665/08038764.pdf","startPage":"645","endPage":"654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Smart City Data in 5G Self-Organizing Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Using Smart City Data in 5G Self-Organizing Networks","volume":"5","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8038764/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17685532","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038764/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Using Smart City Data in 5G Self-Organizing Networks","sourcePdf":"jiot-polese-2752761-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12635S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8334665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8334665","articleId":"8038764","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038769,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroki Tanaka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221039/7807362/8038769/tanak-2752152-small.gif","p":["Hiroki Tanaka received the master\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees from the Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan, in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

Even though some works have detected dementia from speech and language attributes, most have applied detection using picture descriptions, narratives, and cognitive tasks. In this paper, we propose a new computer avatar with spoken dialog functionalities that produces spoken queries based on the mini-mental state examination, the Wechsler memory scale-revised, and other related neuropsychological questions. We recorded the interactive data of spoken dialogues from 29 participants (14 dementia and 15 healthy controls) and extracted various audiovisual features. We tried to predict dementia using audiovisual features and two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and logistic regression). Here, we show that the support vector machines outperformed logistic regression, and by using the extracted features they classified the participants into two groups with 0.93 detection performance, as measured by the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We also newly identified some contributing features, e.g., gap before speaking, the variations of fundamental frequency, voice quality, and the ratio of smiling. We concluded that our system has the potential to detect dementia through spoken dialog systems and that the system can assist health care workers. In addition, these findings could help medical personnel detect signs of dementia.","doi":"10.1109/JTEHM.2017.2752152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JTEHM.2017.2752152","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221039/7807362/08038769.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7807362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Dementia Through Interactive Computer Avatars","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Dementia Through Interactive Computer Avatars","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17246382","pubMedId":"29018636","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","externalId":"2200111","htmlLink":"/document/8038769/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"JP17H06101 and JP16K16172"},{"fundingName":"Yanmar Innovation Lab. 2112"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Detecting Dementia Through Interactive Computer Avatars","sourcePdf":"jtehm-tanaka-2752152-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130489S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221039","isNumber":"7807362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221039","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7807362","articleId":"8038769","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038772,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Alee Khan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, CECOS University, Peshawar, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8038772/khan-2750238-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Alee Khan received the bachelor\u2019s degree in telecommunication from the FAST National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Peshawar, Pakistan, in 2012, he is currently pursuing the master\u2019s degree in electrical (communication) engineering with CECOS University, Peshawar.

Mobile users take their cell phones and other gadgets with them almost everywhere. Thus, integrating location awareness in mobile applications gives users a much more real experience. Therefore, this paper presents an algorithm to predict user location in 5G networks by using received signal strength measurements. Initially, the relative coordinates of users are computed using Isomap. Then the relative coordinates of users are transformed by Procrustes analysis. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, the Cramer-Rao lower bound is derived, which is the lower bound on error variance. It can be concluded from our results that the proposed approach outperforms those found in the existing literature.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2750238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2750238","startPage":"21753","endPage":"21762","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08038772.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location Awareness in 5G Networks Using RSS Measurements for Public Safety Applications","topic":"Mission Critical Public-Safety Communications: Architectures, Enabling Technologies, and Future Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Location Awareness in 5G Networks Using RSS Measurements for Public Safety Applications","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2017","accessionNumber":"17381050","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038772/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning, South Korea","grantNumber":"R-2016-0-00191"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Location Awareness in 5G Networks Using RSS Measurements for Public Safety Applications","sourcePdf":"access-lee-2750238-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122026S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Mission Critical Public-Safety Communications: Architectures, Enabling Technologies, and Future Applications"],"articleId":"8038772","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038776,"authors":[{"name":"Min Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8038776/chen-2751586-small.gif","p":["Min Chen (SM\u201909) was an Assistant Professor with the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University (SNU).

However, both fiber and FSO systems suffer from a variety of impairments, which must be properly modeled in order to design the network. In this paper, we present analytical results for mixed FSO/fiber amplify-and-forward backhauling systems, where the impacts of radio-frequency (RF) co-channel interference, FSO pointing errors, and both fiber and FSO modulator nonlinearity are modeled and taken into consideration. Closed-form and asymptotic expressions are derived for the outage probability, the average bit-error rate, and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the channel capacity for mixed FSO/fiber backhauling systems. Our results reveal an optimal average-launched power for the fiber, which balances the impact of fiber nonlinear distortion with the receiver noise. In particular, when using the optimal fiber average-launched power, our estimated user capacity CDF results show that the 50th percentile user rates using mm-wave RF access can reach over 1.5 Gb/s in ideal conditions. However, user rates are more sensitive to the FSO backhaul channel characteristics.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Fiber Nonlinearity on 5G Backhauling via Mixed FSO/Fiber Network","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2753178","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08038778.pdf","startPage":"19942","endPage":"19950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2753178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038778","topic":"Optical Wireless Technologies for 5G Communications and Beyond","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038778/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Fiber Nonlinearity on 5G Backhauling via Mixed FSO/Fiber Network","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8038778/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17341405","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Telus Corporation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Impact of Fiber Nonlinearity on 5G Backhauling via Mixed FSO/Fiber Network","sourcePdf":"access-morra-2753178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089398S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Optical Wireless Technologies for 5G Communications and Beyond"],"articleId":"8038778","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8038781,"authors":[{"name":"Changju Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Changju","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086155718"},{"name":"Luhong Mao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Luhong","lastName":"Mao","id":"37325187600"},{"name":"Fan Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085498327"},{"name":"Xurui Mao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Integrated Optoelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xurui","lastName":"Mao","id":"37085359735"},{"name":"Weilian Guo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Weilian","lastName":"Guo","id":"37336011500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"8038781","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":386},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"652 KB","file":"/ielx7/4563994/7990618/8038781/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2752841.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/7990618/8038781/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2752841.jpg"},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038781","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","HEMTs","MODFETs","Logic gates","Plasma waves","Integrated circuit modeling","Imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optically switched resonant tunneling diode (ORTD)","high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT)","photo-controlled","amplified modulator"]}],"abstract":"This paper theoretically explores photocontrolled terahertz amplified modulator in electron plasma wave optically switched resonant tunneling diode (ORTD) gate high-electron mobility transistor.

In this paper, we propose a blind detection scheme for the uplink grant-free SCMA transmission based on a novel sparsity-inspired sphere decoding (SI-SD) algorithm. By introducing one additional all-zero code word, each user's status and data can be jointly detected, thus avoiding the redundant pilot overhead. Considering the sparsity features in the grant-free SCMA transmission, we establish its mathematical model where the degree of sparsity is characterized by a transmission probability parameter, which will be estimated during the SI-SD detection process. With such a priori probability, the proposed SI-SD algorithm will achieve the maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection. Furthermore, unlike the conventional sphere decoding, in the grant-free SCMA scenario, strong constraints are proven to exist among the nodes in the proposed SI-SD algorithm which can be utilized to early remove some improbable transmit hypotheses. In addition, a reduced sparsity-inspired MAP metric constitutes a tight sphere constraint which in turn implies less valid hypotheses within the search sphere. By using the above two strategies, the complexity of the SI-SD can be efficiently reduced.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2752741","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08038784.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2752741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","startPage":"19983","endPage":"19993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparsity-Inspired Sphere Decoding (SI-SD): A Novel Blind Detection Algorithm for Uplink Grant-Free Sparse Code Multiple Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sparsity-Inspired Sphere Decoding (SI-SD): A Novel Blind Detection Algorithm for Uplink Grant-Free Sparse Code Multiple Access","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038784/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17341406","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038784/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671080 and 61171099"},{"fundingName":"BUPT-SICE Excellent Graduate Students Innovation Fund"},{"fundingName":"Huawei HIRP project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Sparsity-Inspired Sphere Decoding (SI-SD): A Novel Blind Detection Algorithm for Uplink Grant-Free Sparse Code Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"access-niu-2752741-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126485S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8038784","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8038791,"authors":[{"name":"Imran Baig","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dhofar University, Salalah, Sultanate of Oman"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8038791/baig-2752804-small.gif","p":["Imran Baig (M\u201915) received the M.Sc. degree in computer engineering from the University of Engineering Technology, Taxilla, Pakistan, in 2005 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Malaysia, in 2012.

Stochastic gradient (SG)-based non-parametric maximum likelihood (NPML) estimator, gives better channel estimates in the presence of Gaussian mixture (AWGN plus interference) noise processes, for subsequent use by the channel equalizer. However, for sparse channels, the SG-NPML-based channel estimator requires large iterations to converge. In this paper, we propose a natural gradient (NG)-based channel estimator for sparse channel estimation in the presence of high interference. We propose a generalized pth order warping transformation on channel coefficients space and then calculate the Riemannian metric tensor, thereby resulting in faster convergence in interference limited channels. The proposed algorithm is applied for IEEE 802.22 (based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) channel estimation in the presence of interference. Extensive simulations and experimental results show that the proposed NG-based algorithm converges faster than SG-NPML for the same mean squared error (MSE) floor with similar computational complexity per iteration as an SG-NPML algorithm. We also present convergence analysis of proposed NG-NPML algorithm in the presence of Gaussian mixture noise and derive an analytical expression for the steady-state MSE.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2748144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

paper, we compare the performance of probabilistically shaped 64QAM with uniform 16QAM and 32QAM modulation formats at the same net data rate in long-haul coherent optical communications systems. Experimental results at 16 GBaud are shown, with offline postprocessing of the data performed using either an ideal or a realistic carrier phase estimation (CPE) scheme. We show that the choice of the CPE algorithm at the receiver is crucial, since, as predicted by current models, most of the additional nonlinear noise introduced by the shaping is nonlinear phase noise (NLPN). Thanks to the use of probabilistic shaping (PS), maximum reach gains ranging from 15.5% and 34% are obtained over pure silica-core fiber, where the NLPN can be efficiently compensated for by standard CPE algorithms, while over nonzero dispersion-shifted fiber, the gain of PS is drastically reduced, due to residual short-correlated NLPN.","supplementGroup":[{"repository":"code-ocean","type":"algorithm","badge":"Available","badgeMsg":"This document includes code submitted by the author.","supplement":[{"doi":"10.24433/CO.5457868.v1","uri":"https://codeocean.com/capsule/4965126","name":"Comparison of Probabilistically Shaped 64QAM With Lower Cardinality Uniform Constellations in Long-Haul Optical Systems","language":"MATLAB","widgetUrl":"https://codeocean.com/widget.js?id=af6f8e11-561b-4d06-b0b1-48ed0dc8d83c","badgeType":"Code-Available"}]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038794/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2018","volume":"36","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"17595746","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8038794/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Probabilistically Shaped 64QAM With Lower Cardinality Uniform Constellations in Long-Haul Optical Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Cisco Photonics with an SRA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Probabilistically Shaped 64QAM With Lower Cardinality Uniform Constellations in Long-Haul Optical Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-pilori-2752842-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127717S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8290594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8290594","articleId":"8038794","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038796,"authors":[{"name":"Weiguo Sheng","affiliation":["Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8038796/sheng-2752901-small.gif","p":["Weiguo Sheng received the M.Sc. degree in information technology from the University of Nottingham, U.K., in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Brunel University, U.K., in 2005.

This paper presents an adaptive memetic algorithm with a rank-based mutation, denoted as AMARM, to design ANN architectures. The proposed algorithm introduces an adaptive multi-local search mechanism to simultaneously fine-tune the number of hidden neurons and connection weights. The adaptation of the multi-local search mechanism is achieved by identifying effective local searches based on their search characteristics. Such an algorithm is distinguishable from previous evolutionary algorithm-based methods that incorporate one single local search for evolving ANN architectures. Furthermore, a rank-based mutation strategy is devised for avoiding premature convergence during evolution. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated on a number of benchmark problems and compared with related work. The results show that the AMARM can be used to design compact ANN architectures with good generalization capability, outperforming related work.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2752901","startPage":"18895","endPage":"18908","publicationTitle":"IEEE

protocols have been proposed to achieve uplink/downlink fairness in IEEE 802.11 systems. To successfully guarantee the fairness in unsaturated carrier sensing multiple access (CSMA) systems, it is important to accurately estimate the number of backlogged nodes considering both of the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) traffic. In this letter, we propose a backlog estimation mechanism for the bidirectional media access control to guarantee UL/DL fairness in an unsaturated CSMA environment. We derive the optimal transmit probability and the optimal DL transmit opportunity for BT as a function of the estimated backlog size. The proposed algorithm ensures the near-perfect UL/DL fairness while improving the overall system performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","volume":"21","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"17414956","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038798/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Backlog Estimation for Uplink/Downlink Fairness in Unsaturated Bidirectional CSMA Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"\u2018The Cross-Ministry Giga KOREA Project\u2019"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Korea government(MSIT), Research and Development of Open 5G Reference Model","grantNumber":"GK17S0400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Korea government(MSIP)","grantNumber":"NRF-2015R1C1A1A01053857"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backlog Estimation for Uplink/Downlink Fairness in Unsaturated Bidirectional CSMA Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-sung-2752744-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047334S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8170462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8170462","articleId":"8038798","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038800,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Cheng","affiliation":["Center of Excellence for Research in Computational Intelligence and Applications, School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/8478014/8038800/cheng-2744328-small.gif","p":["Ran Cheng (M\u201916) received the B.Sc. degree in computer science and technology from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2010 and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K., in 2016.","He is currently a Research Fellow with the CERCIA Group, School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K. His current research interests include evolutionary multiobjective optimization, evolutionary multimodal optimization, model-based evolutionary algorithms, large-scale optimization, and swarm intelligence.","Dr. Cheng is a recipient of the 2018 IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation Outstanding Paper Award.

While most existing work of multiobjectivization aims to find all optimal solutions simultaneously, in this paper, we propose to approximate multimodal fitness landscapes via multiobjectivization, thus providing an estimation of potential optimal areas. To begin with, an MMO problem is transformed into a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) by adding an adaptive diversity indicator as the second optimization objective, and an approximate fitness landscape is obtained via optimization of the transformed MOP using a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. Then, on the basis of the approximate fitness landscape, an adaptive peak detection method is proposed to find peaks where optimal solutions may exist. Finally, local search is performed inside the detected peaks on the approximate fitness landscape. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments are conducted on 20 multimodal test functions, in comparison with three state-of-the-art algorithms for MMO. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only shows promising performance in benchmark comparisons, but also has good potential in assisting preference-based decision-making in MMO.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038800/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","volume":"22","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18129898","htmlLink":"/document/8038800/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization-Based Multimodal Optimization: Fitness Landscape Approximation and Peak Detection","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/K001523/1 and EP/J017515/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization-Based Multimodal Optimization: Fitness Landscape Approximation and Peak Detection","sourcePdf":"tevc-cheng-2744328-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106038S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"8478014","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8478014","articleId":"8038800","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8038801,"authors":[{"name":"Da Li","affiliation":["Zhejiang Key Lab of Advanced Micro/;Nano-Electronic Smart Systems and Applications, College of Information Science & Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/8248570/8038801/dli-2748566-small.gif","p":["Da Li received the B.S. degree in the field of information and\n communication engineering from the College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University,\n Hangzhou, China, in 2014, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","In 2017, he joined Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, as a Project Researcher.

This new design employs the vertical vias into the 2-D periodic arrays, and such a single 2.5-D periodic layer of via-based structure is demonstrated to produce a highly stable angular response up to 60\u00b0 for both TE and TM polarizations. By cascading two layers of such 2.5-D periodic arrays, the proposed FSS is able to obtain a broad passband as well as the wide out-of-band rejection. Moreover, it has a quite sharp band edge between the passband and the specified stopband. A corresponding equivalent circuit model (ECM) is further developed for better analysis of the operating principle. Finally, a prototype working at the center frequency of around 28 GHz is fabricated and measured. The main novelty of this paper is introducing the 2.5-D concept into designing a wideband FSS, and further reduce the unit size as well as improve the angular stability. Favorable agreement is achieved among the 3-D full-wave simulation, ECM and measurement. All these results demonstrate that the proposed FSS is a good candidate for 5G EMI shielding.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8248570","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel7/15/8248570/08038801.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2017.2748566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2017.2748566","startPage":"768","endPage":"775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2.5-D Angularly Stable Frequency Selective Surface Using Via-Based Structure for 5G EMI Shielding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038801/","displayDocTitle":"A 2.5-D Angularly Stable Frequency Selective Surface Using Via-Based Structure for 5G EMI Shielding","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8038801/","volume":"60","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"17485556","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371031 and 61571395"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds of the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2017X22X009-02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2.5-D Angularly Stable Frequency Selective Surface Using Via-Based Structure for 5G EMI Shielding","sourcePdf":"temc-li-2748566-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082583S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"8248570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8248570","articleId":"8038801","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8038809,"authors":[{"name":"Karel Toledo de la Garza","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Santiago de Chile, Santiago de Chile, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8314245/8038809/toled-2746747-small.gif","p":["Karel Toledo de la Garza was born in Cuba, in 1988.

In this paper, a novel low-pass filter design technique with time-varying parameters is introduced in order to minimize the rise-time parameter. Through the use of calculus of variations a method is developed to obtain the optimal closed-form expression for adjusting the parameters. In this context, two cases are addressed: the ideal case in which infinite bandwidth is required and a solution of finite bandwidth. The latter is obtained by means of a proper constraint formulation in the frequency domain. The proposed filter achieves the shortest rise time and allows better preservation of the edge shape in comparison with other existing filtering methods. The analysis, synthesis, and performance of the proposed system are discussed and illustrated with the aid of simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2746747","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8314245/08038809.pdf","startPage":"1303","endPage":"1313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8314245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2746747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Variational Approach for Designing Infinite Impulse Response Filters With Time-Varying Parameters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"A Variational Approach for Designing Infinite Impulse Response Filters With Time-Varying Parameters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038809/","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17617615","htmlLink":"/document/8038809/","volume":"65","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish National Project ELISA","grantNumber":"TEC2014-59255-C3-3-R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Variational Approach for Designing Infinite Impulse Response Filters With Time-Varying Parameters","sourcePdf":"tcsi-toledodelagarza-2746747-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092895S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8314245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8314245","articleId":"8038809","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038812,"authors":[{"name":"Aritra Bhowmik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Aritra","lastName":"Bhowmik","id":"37086220323"},{"name":"Suprosanna Shit","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Suprosanna","lastName":"Shit","id":"37085355328"},{"name":"Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Chandra Sekhar","lastName":"Seelamantula","id":"37545336100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"8038812","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1754},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038812","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laplace equations","Training","Image resolution","Signal resolution","Feature extraction","Convolution","Dictionaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","image representation","image resolution","Laplace equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic convolutional network","single-image super-resolution","HR \u2192 LR generative model","low-resolution-high-resolution image representations","Gaussian pyramids","Laplacian pyramids"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural network (CNN)","deep learning","dynamic convolutional network (DCN)","Gaussian/Laplacian pyramids","super-resolution (SR)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LSP.2017.2752806","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/8105926/08038812.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","startPage":"85","endPage":"89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8105926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2017.2752806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training-Free, Single-Image Super-Resolution Using a Dynamic Convolutional Network","abstract":"The typical approach for solving the problem of single-image super-resolution (SR) is to learn a nonlinear mapping between the low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) representations of images in a training set. Training-based approaches can be tuned to give high accuracy on a given class of images, but they call for retraining if the HR \u2192 LR generative model deviates or if the test images belong to a different class, which limits their applicability. On the other hand, we propose a solution that does not require a training dataset. Our method relies on constructing a dynamic convolutional network (DCN) to learn the relation between the consecutive scales of Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids. The relation is in turn used to predict the detail at a finer scale, thus leading to SR. Comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques on standard datasets show that the proposed DCN approach results in about 0.8 and 0.3 dB gain in peak signal-to-noise ratio for 2\u00d7 and 3\u00d7 SR, respectively. The structural similarity index is on par with the competing techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038812/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17390438","volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8038812/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Training-Free, Single-Image Super-Resolution Using a Dynamic Convolutional Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training-Free, Single-Image Super-Resolution Using a Dynamic Convolutional Network","sourcePdf":"lsp-seelamantula-2752806-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066564S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"8105926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8105926","articleId":"8038812","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8038813,"authors":[{"name":"Tossaporn Surinkaew","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8279661/8038813/surin-2752762-small.gif","p":["Tossaporn Surinkaew received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in\n electrical engineering from the King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand, in 2012 and\n 2014, respectively.","His research interests include small-signal and transient stabilities, and control of renewable energy."]},"firstName":"Tossaporn","lastName":"Surinkaew","id":"37071297700"},{"name":"Issarachai Ngamroo","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8279661/8038813/ngamr-2752762-small.gif","p":["Issarachai Ngamroo (SM\u201916) received the Ph.D. degree in\n electrical engineering from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 2000.","He is currently a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's\n Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand.

With externally generated random parameters, IoM hashing transforms a real-valued biometric feature vector into discrete index (max ranked) hashed code. We demonstrate two realizations from IoM hashing notion, namely, Gaussian random projection-based and uniformly random permutation-based hashing schemes. The discrete indices representation nature of IoM hashed codes enjoys several merits. First, IoM hashing empowers strong concealment to the biometric information. This contributes to the solid ground of non-invertibility guarantee. Second, IoM hashing is insensitive to the features magnitude, hence is more robust against biometric features variation. Third, the magnitude-independence trait of IoM hashing makes the hash codes being scale-invariant, which is critical for matching and feature alignment. The experimental results demonstrate favorable accuracy performance on benchmark FVC2002 and FVC2004 fingerprint databases. The analyses justify its resilience to the existing and newly introduced security and privacy attacks as well as satisfy the revocability and unlinkability criteria of cancelable biometrics.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ranking-Based Locality Sensitive Hashing-Enabled Cancelable Biometrics: Index-of-Max Hashing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2753172","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8123527/08038818.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2017.2753172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8123527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038818/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Ranking-Based Locality Sensitive Hashing-Enabled Cancelable Biometrics: Index-of-Max Hashing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8038818/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17394307","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion (IITP) through the Korean Government (MSIT) (Development of Biometrics-Based Key Infrastructure Technology for On-line Identification)","grantNumber":"2016-0-00097"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ranking-Based Locality Sensitive Hashing-Enabled Cancelable Biometrics: Index-of-Max Hashing","sourcePdf":"tifs-teoh-2753172-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105384S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8123527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"8123527","articleId":"8038818","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8038819,"authors":[{"name":"Erfan Azarkhish","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/8258926/8038819/azark-2752706-small.gif","p":["Erfan Azarkhish received the BSc and MSc degrees from the University\n of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2007, and 2009, respectively.

This trend is also creating new opportunities to revisit near-memory computation. In this paper, we propose a flexible processor-in-memory (PIM) solution for scalable and energy-efficient execution of deep convolutional networks (ConvNets), one of the fastest-growing workloads for servers and high-end embedded systems. Our co-design approach consists of a network of Smart Memory Cubes (modular extensions to the standard HMC) each augmented with a many-core PIM platform called NeuroCluster. NeuroClusters have a modular design based on NeuroStream coprocessors (for Convolution-intensive computations) and general-purpose RISC-V cores. In addition, a DRAM-friendly tiling mechanism and a scalable computation paradigm are presented to efficiently harness this computational capability with a very low programming effort. NeuroCluster occupies only 8 percent of the total logic-base (LoB) die area in a standard HMC and achieves an average performance of 240 GFLOPS for complete execution of full-featured state-of-the-art (SoA) ConvNets within a power budget of 2.5 W. Overall 11 W is consumed in a single SMC device, with 22.5 GFLOPS/W energy-efficiency which is 3.5X better than the best GPU implementations in similar technologies. The minor increase in system-level power and the negligible area increase make our PIM system a cost-effective and energy efficient solution, easily scalable to 955 GFLOPS with a small network of just four SMCs.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2017.2752706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8258926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2017.2752706","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/8258926/08038819.pdf","startPage":"420","endPage":"434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neurostream: Scalable and Energy Efficient Deep Learning with Smart Memory Cubes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Neurostream: Scalable and Energy Efficient Deep Learning with Smart Memory Cubes","volume":"29","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 1 2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8038819/","publicationDate":"1 Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17541406","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038819/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neurostream: Scalable and Energy Efficient Deep Learning with Smart Memory Cubes","sourcePdf":"tpds-azarkhish-2752706-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126124S","chronDate":"Feb. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"8258926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8258926","articleId":"8038819","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038820,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathon Edstrom","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687317/8653629/8038820/edstr-2750699-small.gif","p":["Jonathon Edstrom received the BS degree in computer engineering and the MS degree in electrical and computer engineering from North Dakota State University, Fargo, North Dakota, in 2015 and 2017, respectively.

However, due to the large video data size and intensive computation, mobile video applications require frequent embedded memory access, which consumes a large amount of power and limits battery life. In this paper, we present a low-cost self-recovery video storage system by investigating meaningful data patterns hidden in big video data, by introducing data mining techniques to the hardware design process. We propose a two-dimensional data-pattern approach to explore horizontal data-association and vertical data-correlation characteristics. Such data relationship discovery and pattern identification enable a new dimension for the hardware design space and bring self-recovery ability to memories in the presence of bitcell failures. Based on the identified optimal data patterns, we present a low-cost and efficient SRAM design to enable data self-recovery at low voltages. A 45nm 32 kb SRAM is implemented that delivers good video quality at near-threshold voltage (0.5 V) with negligible area overhead (7.94 percent).","doi":"10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2750699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2750699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Big Data","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Big Data","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687317/8653629/08038820.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8653629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038820/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1 2019","displayDocTitle":"Data-Pattern Enabled Self-Recovery Low-Power Storage System for Big Video Data","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18489549","htmlLink":"/document/8038820/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2019","publicationDate":"1 March 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1514780 and CNS-1628961"},{"fundingName":"ND NASA EPSCoR"},{"fundingName":"ND Venture"},{"fundingName":"NDSU-RCA"},{"fundingName":"Offerdahl Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Pattern Enabled Self-Recovery Low-Power Storage System for Big Video Data","sourcePdf":"tbdata-gong-2750699-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132613S","chronDate":"March 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"6687317","isNumber":"8653629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687317","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8653629","articleId":"8038820","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8038832,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper investigates the practical difficulties of the vehicular CPSs online implementation, and based on that proposes a fault diagnosis and control architecture with modular units and reserved extendibility. It is elaborated that the systems' adaptability could be enhanced by either the online tracking techniques or the ensemble learning schemes. For the onboard deployment of automobile CPSs, the requirement of real-time capacity is in focus. A new recursive total principle component regression based design and implementation approach is proposed for efficient data-driven fault detection. Simulation tests were carried out on the Carsim to compare the proposed approach with multiple existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2752709","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8331183/08038833.pdf","startPage":"1415","endPage":"1423","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2752709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8331183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive Total Principle Component Regression Based Fault Detection and Its Application to Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Recursive Total Principle Component Regression Based Fault Detection and Its Application to Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2018","accessionNumber":"17670266","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8038833/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61304102, 61472104 and 61333012"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"HIT.BRETIV.201507 and TII-17-0745"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive Total Principle Component Regression Based Fault Detection and Its Application to Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems","sourcePdf":"tii-yin-2752709-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074763S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8331183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"8331183","articleId":"8038833","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":8038834,"authors":[{"name":"Shahbaz A.

The deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) at key locations provides an opportunity for devising effective power system monitoring and control measures. In this study, a new method is proposed to determine the real-time transient stability status and identification of the coherent generator groups by predicting the rotor angle values following a large disturbance through radial basis function neural network. The first six cycles of synchronously sampled post-fault data measurements from PMUs consisting of rotor angles and voltages of generators are taken as the input to the neural network to predict the future state of the system. The proposed method can also determine the synchronism state of the individual machine in real time. The proposed scheme is demonstrated on the IEEE-39 bus test system at different operating conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2017.2753176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2017.2753176","startPage":"685","endPage":"692","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/8263327/08038834.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8263327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Monitoring of Post-Fault Scenario for Determining Generator Coherency and Transient Stability Through ANN","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Monitoring of Post-Fault Scenario for Determining Generator Coherency and Transient Stability Through ANN","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2018","volume":"54","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8038834/","accessionNumber":"17519376","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038834/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Monitoring of Post-Fault Scenario for Determining Generator Coherency and Transient Stability Through ANN","sourcePdf":"tia-siddiqui-2753176-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073402S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"8263327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8263327","articleId":"8038834","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":8038841,"authors":[{"name":"Ryota Nakai","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Koganei, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8290782/8038841/nakai-2751582-small.gif","p":["Ryota\u00a0Nakai (S\u201917) was born in Shizuoka, Japan, in 1994.\n He received the B.E. degree in computer and information sciences from Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology,\n Koganei, Japan, in 2017.

The proposed relaying scheme relies on two concepts: the simultaneous activation of multiple source-to-relay links and buffer-state-based relay selection for packet transmission and reception. In order to avoid buffer overflow, as well as an empty buffer at the relay nodes, we introduce a novel thresholding scheme that gives priority to link selection. The proposed scheme is capable of achieving a lower outage probability and a lower end-to-end packet delay than existing buffer-aided relaying protocols. Moreover, the concept of collaborative beamforming is invoked for the proposed buffer-aided relaying scheme, in order to improve the received signal-to-noise ratio at the destination node. We also derive analytical bounds of the outage probability and the average packet delay of the proposed scheme with the aid of Markov-chain analysis. Our simulation results demonstrate the clear performance advantages of the proposed scheme over conventional schemes, which are especially explicit for scenarios with a high number of relay nodes.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2751582","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular

We propose a variable-\u03b1 activation function ANN-NLE with a faster convergence speed and a stronger equalization ability to solve the nonlinear problems generated from the RoF link. To the best of our knowledge, this letter is the first to apply an adaptive activation function ANN to solve a classification problem and equalize the signals in a 60-GHz RoF system.

Iterative reconstruction algorithms are one of the most promising way to compensate for the increased noise due to reduction of photon flux. Most iterative reconstruction algorithms incorporate manually designed prior functions of the reconstructed image to suppress noises while maintaining structures of the image. These priors basically rely on smoothness constraints and cannot exploit more complex features of the image. The recent development of artificial neural networks and machine learning enabled learning of more complex features of image, which has the potential to improve reconstruction quality. In this letter, K-sparse auto encoder was used for unsupervised feature learning. A manifold was learned from normal-dose images and the distance between the reconstructed image and the manifold was minimized along with data fidelity during reconstruction. Experiments on 2016 Low-dose CT Grand Challenge were used for the method verification, and results demonstrated the noise reduction and detail preservation abilities of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/8124116/08038851.pdf","startPage":"2479","endPage":"2486","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2017.2753138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2017.2753138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8124116","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Low-Dose CT Reconstruction With Priors Trained by Artificial Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Computed tomography","Manifolds","Neural networks","Reconstruction algorithms","Decoding","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","dosimetry","image denoising","image reconstruction","iterative methods","medical image processing","neural nets","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative low-dose CT reconstruction","dose reduction","computed tomography","radiation risk","iterative reconstruction algorithms","photon flux","smoothness constraints","artificial neural networks","machine learning","reconstruction quality","K-sparse auto encoder","unsupervised feature learning","normal-dose images","reconstructed image","data fidelity","2016 Low-dose CT Grand Challenge","noise reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","computed tomography","iterative algorithms","k-sparse auto encoder","reconstruction algorithms"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Abdomen","Algorithms","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Radiation Dosage","Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Thorax","Tomography, X-Ray Computed"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Low-Dose CT Reconstruction With Priors Trained by Artificial Neural Network","volume":"36","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8038851/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17377808","pubMedId":"28922116","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"R01EB013293 and R01AG052653"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Low-Dose CT Reconstruction With Priors Trained by Artificial Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tmi-wu-2753138-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096523S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"8124116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"8124116","articleId":"8038851","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8038860,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Chen","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of Data Security and Privacy Preserving, Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Data Security and Privacy Preserving, College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8440865/8038860/chen-2740318-small.gif","p":["Xin Chen received the master\u2019s degree from the College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, in 2015, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","Her current research interests include computer vision, machine learning, and action/gait recognition."]},"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0003-2903-5525","id":"37085430777"},{"name":"Jian Weng","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of Data Security and Privacy Preserving, Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Data Security and Privacy Preserving, College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8440865/8038860/weng-2740318-small.gif","p":["Jian Weng received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2007.","He is currently a Professor with the College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.

However, there have been a few investigations on how to utilize the structural manifold information among different action videos to enhance the recognition accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we propose to incorporate the manifold of training samples into deep learning, which is defined as deep manifold learning (DML). The proposed DML framework can be adapted to most existing deep networks to learn more discriminative features for action recognition. When applied to a convolutional neural network, DML embeds the previous convolutional layer's manifold into the next convolutional layer; thus, the discriminative capacity of the next layer can be promoted. We also apply the DML on a restricted Boltzmann machine, which can alleviate the overfitting problem. Experimental results on four standard action databases (i.e., UCF101, HMDB51, KTH, and UCF sports) show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2740318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2740318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8440865/08038860.pdf","startPage":"3938","endPage":"3952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8440865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038860/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Deep Manifold Learning Combined With Convolutional Neural Networks for Action Recognition","volume":"29","issue":"9","pubMedId":"28922128","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18042999","htmlLink":"/document/8038860/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472165"},{"fundingName":"Key Program for Guangdong Province Applied Science and Technology Research and Development Special Funds","grantNumber":"2016B010124009"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Key Laboratory of Data Security and Privacy Preserving"},{"fundingName":"Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Data Security and Privacy Preserving","grantNumber":"201705030004"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Engineering Technology Research and Development Center of Network Security Detection and Protection"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Engineering Technology Research Center of Privacy Preservation and Data Security and the Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program","grantNumber":"2014ZT05D238"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2016A030313350"},{"fundingName":"Special Funds for Science and Technology Development of Guangdong","grantNumber":"2016KZ010103"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"16lgjc83"},{"fundingName":"Scientific and Technological Achievements Transformation Plan of Sun Yat-sen University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Manifold Learning Combined With Convolutional Neural Networks for Action Recognition","sourcePdf":"tnnls-weng-2740318-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135457S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8440865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8440865","articleId":"8038860","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8038861,"authors":[{"name":"Shuping Gong","affiliation":["The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA","Sequans Communications, Bedminster, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8103134/8038861/gong-2750688-small.gif","p":["Shuping Gong received the B.S. degree in information and communication engineering from Hainan University, Haikou, China, in 2004, the M.S. degree in communication engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA, in 2013.

However, as a result of the way that training data and predictor variables are randomly selected for use in constructing each tree and splitting each node, it is also well known that if too few trees are generated, variable importance rankings tend to differ between model runs. In this letter, we characterize the effect of the number of trees (ntree) and class separability on the stability of variable importance rankings and develop a systematic approach to define the number of model runs and/or trees required to achieve stability in variable importance measures. Results demonstrate that both a large ntree for a single model run, or averaged values across multiple model runs with fewer trees, are sufficient for achieving stable mean importance values. While the latter is far more computationally efficient, both the methods tend to lead to the same ranking of variables. Moreover, the optimal number of model runs differs depending on the separability of classes. Recommendations are made to users regarding how to determine the number of model runs and/or trees that are required to achieve stable variable importance rankings.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2017.2745049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2017.2745049","startPage":"1988","endPage":"1992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/8082817/08038868.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8082817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Systematic Approach for Variable Selection With Random Forests: Achieving Stable Variable Importance Values","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Systematic Approach for Variable Selection With Random Forests: Achieving Stable Variable Importance Values","volume":"14","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17284812","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038868/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008638","fundingName":"Environment and Climate Change Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002956","fundingName":"Defence Research and Development Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Systematic Approach for Variable Selection With Random Forests: Achieving Stable Variable Importance Values","sourcePdf":"lgrs-behnamian-2745049-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073997S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"8082817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8082817","articleId":"8038868","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038869,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Mozaffari","affiliation":["Wireless@VT, Virginia Tech, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8103134/8038869/mozaf-2751045-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Mozaffari (S\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Iran, and the M.Sc. degree in geomatics engineering from the University of Calgary, Canada.

In particular, to enable reliable uplink communications for the IoT devices with a minimum total transmit power, a novel framework is proposed for jointly optimizing the 3D placement and the mobility of the UAVs, device-UAV association, and uplink power control. First, given the locations of active IoT devices at each time instant, the optimal UAVs' locations and associations are determined. Next, to dynamically serve the IoT devices in a time-varying network, the optimal mobility patterns of the UAVs are analyzed. To this end, based on the activation process of the IoT devices, the time instances at which the UAVs must update their locations are derived. Moreover, the optimal 3D trajectory of each UAV is obtained in a way that the total energy used for the mobility of the UAVs is minimized while serving the IoT devices. Simulation results show that, using the proposed approach, the total-transmit power of the IoT devices is reduced by 45% compared with a case, in which stationary aerial base stations are deployed. In addition, the proposed approach can yield a maximum of 28% enhanced system reliability compared with the stationary case. The results also reveal an inherent tradeoff between the number of update times, the mobility of the UAVs, and the transmit power of the IoT devices. In essence, a higher number of updates can lead to lower transmit powers for the IoT devices at the cost of an increased mobility for the UAVs.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2751045","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8103134/08038869.pdf","startPage":"7574","endPage":"7589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2751045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for Energy-Efficient Internet of Things Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038869","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/8103134/8038869-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for Energy-Efficient Internet of Things Communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038869/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17372697","htmlLink":"/document/8038869/","volume":"16","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"AST-1506297, OAC-1541105 and IIS-1633363"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"U.S. Office of Naval Research (ONR)","grantNumber":"N00014-15-1-2709"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"ERC Starting Grant MORE (Advanced Mathematical Tools for Complex Network Engineering)"},{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland (CARMA)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Mobile Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for Energy-Efficient Internet of Things Communications","sourcePdf":"twc-mozaffari-2751045-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111627S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8103134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"334","xplore-issue":"8103134","articleId":"8038869","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038870,"authors":[{"name":"Arsalan Mosenia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687315/8466693/8038870/mosen-2751462-small.gif","p":["Arsalan Mosenia received the BS degree in computer engineering from\n the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2012, and the MA degree in electrical engineering from\n Princeton, New Jersey, USA, in 2014.

A few recent research studies discuss the feasibility of processing sensory data gathered by a smartphone to locate the phone's owner, even when the user does not intend to share his location information, e.g., when the user has turned off the Global Positioning System (GPS) on the device. Previous research efforts rely on at least one of the two following fundamental requirements, which impose significant limitations on the adversary: (i) the attacker must accurately know either the user's initial location or the set of routes through which the user travels and/or (ii) the attacker must measure a set of features, e.g., device acceleration, for different potential routes in advance and construct a training dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that neither of the above-mentioned requirements is essential for compromising the user's location privacy. We describe PinMe, a novel user-location mechanism that exploits non-sensory/sensory data stored on the smartphone, e.g., the environment's air pressure and device's timezone, along with publicly-available auxiliary information, e.g., elevation maps, to estimate the user's location when all location services, e.g., GPS, are turned off. Unlike previously-proposed attacks, PinMe neither requires any prior knowledge about the user nor a training dataset on specific routes. We demonstrate that PinMe can accurately estimate the user's location during four activities (walking, traveling on a train, driving, and traveling on a plane). We also suggest several defenses against the proposed attack.","doi":"10.1109/TMSCS.2017.2751462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8466693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMSCS.2017.2751462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687315/8466693/08038870.pdf","startPage":"420","endPage":"435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PinMe: Tracking a Smartphone User around the World","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"PinMe: Tracking a Smartphone User around the World","volume":"4","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2018","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8038870/","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18080049","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038870/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PinMe: Tracking a Smartphone User around the World","sourcePdf":"tmscs-mosenia-2751462-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151274S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"8466693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8466693","articleId":"8038870","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038934,"authors":[{"name":"Xiantao Cheng","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8103134/8038934/cheng-2751046-small.gif","p":["Xiantao Cheng (M\u201907) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2006.

Suppose that a base station communicates with K mobile users, then the task is to estimate K channel matrices, each corresponding to one user. Due to the limited scattering in physical propagation, each channel matrix is sparse in the virtual angular domain. Besides, different user links tend to share some common scatterers. As such, different channel matrices may have a partially common sparsity pattern. These observations motivate us to take a variational Bayesian inference based approach for channel estimation. Specifically, we design a Gaussian mixture prior model, which can efficiently capture the individual sparsity in each channel matrix and the partially joint sparsity shared by different channel matrices. Furthermore, we develop a variational expectation maximization strategy to estimate the hyperparameters associated with the prior model and the channel matrices. Compared with the existing counterparts, the proposed approach achieves much better performance in terms of the channel estimation accuracy, while maintaining a low computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2751046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8103134/08038934.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2751046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103134","startPage":"7590","endPage":"7602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation for FDD Multi-User Massive MIMO: A Variational Bayesian Inference-Based Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation for FDD Multi-User Massive MIMO: A Variational Bayesian Inference-Based Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038934/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17372698","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038934/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371103 and 61771101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation for FDD Multi-User Massive MIMO: A Variational Bayesian Inference-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"twc-cheng-2751046-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118363S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8103134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8103134","articleId":"8038934","onlineDate":"15 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8038937,"authors":[{"name":"Teng Cheng","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Teng","lastName":"Cheng","orcid":"0000-0001-7862-5498","id":"37085624376"},{"name":"Kam-Weng Tam","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Kam-Weng","lastName":"Tam","id":"37271836500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"8038937","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1357},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Band-pass filters","Tuning","Wideband","P-i-n diodes","Poles and zeros","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","circuit tuning","microwave filters","p-i-n diodes","resonator filters","UHF filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tuning states","wideband bandpass filter","reconfigurable bandwidth","cross-shaped resonator","parallel-coupled line structure","open stubs","tuning elements","fractional bandwidth","p-i-n diodes","reconfigurable bandpass filter","frequency 1.22 GHz","frequency 5.7 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandpass filters (BPF)","cross-shaped resonator (CSR)","p-i-n diode","reconfigurable filters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8038937","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/8059715/08038937.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2017.2746679","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2017.2746679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8059715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wideband Bandpass Filter With Reconfigurable Bandwidth Based on Cross-Shaped Resonator","abstract":"A wideband bandpass filter (BPF) with reconfigurable bandwidth (BW) is proposed based on a parallel-coupled line structure and a cross-shaped resonator with open stubs.

Researchers working in the field of statistical signal processing and control are aware of the numerous issues facing the use of the KF in practice: insufficient robustness against mismodeling [4] and temporary uncertainties [2], the strong effect of the initial values [1], and high vulnerability to errors in the noise statistics [5]-[7].","doi":"10.1109/MCS.2017.2718830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.2017.2718830","startPage":"70","endPage":"89","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/5488303/8038931/08038972.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unbiased Finite Impluse Response Filtering: An Iterative Alternative to Kalman Filtering Ignoring Noise and Initial Conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8038972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Unbiased Finite Impluse Response Filtering: An Iterative Alternative to Kalman Filtering Ignoring Noise and Initial Conditions","volume":"37","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17189084","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8038972/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unbiased Finite Impluse Response Filtering: An Iterative Alternative to Kalman Filtering Ignoring Noise and Initial Conditions","sourcePdf":"37mcs05-shmaliy-2718830-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.208947S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5488303","isNumber":"8038931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"8038931","articleId":"8038972","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8038992,"authors":[{"name":"Arnau Fombuena","affiliation":["Polytechnic University of Valencia"],"bio":{"p":["Arnau Fombuena (fombuena@nsu.ac.kr) received his B.S. degree in land surveying engineering in 2009 and his M.S. degree in geodesy and cartography in 2012, both from the Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain.

To remedy the defects of recognizer based on electromyogram (EMG), we develop a pure mechanical sensor architecture for intent pattern recognition of lower-limb motion. The sensor system is composed of an accelerometer, a gyroscope mounted on the prosthetic socket, and two pressure sensors mounted under the sole. To compensate the delay in the control of prosthesis, the signals in the stance phase are used to predict the terrain and speed in the swing phase. Specifically, the intent pattern recognizer utilizes intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) according to the Cartesian product of walking speed and terrain. Moreover, the sensor data are fused via DempsterShafer's theory. And hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to recognize the realtime motion state with the reference of the prior step. The proposed method can infer the prosthesis user's intent of walking on different terrain, which includes level ground, stair ascent, stair descent, up and down ramp. The experiments demonstrate that the intent pattern recognizer is capable of identifying five typical terrain-modes with the rate of 95.8%. The outcome of this investigation is expected to substantially improve the control performance of powered above-knee prosthesis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039023/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17189144","publicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Intent pattern recognition of lower-limb motion based on mechanical sensors","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Intent pattern recognition of lower-limb motion based on mechanical sensors","sourcePdf":"JAS040409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030736S","chronDate":"2017","isNumber":"8039012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570654","citationCount":"30","articleId":"8039023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":8039051,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmud Hossain","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Alabama at, Birmingham, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Mahmud","lastName":"Hossain","id":"37086088790"},{"name":"Ragib Hasan","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Alabama at, Birmingham, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Ragib","lastName":"Hasan","id":"37419422100"},{"name":"Shams Zawoad","affiliation":["Visa Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Shams","lastName":"Zawoad","id":"37070388300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2011-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2010-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2012-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8039051","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1152},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039051","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forensics","Smart phones","Cloud computing","Aggregates","Internet of Things","Microcontrollers","Bluetooth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital forensics","Internet of Things","mobile computing","traffic engineering computing","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Trust-IoV","trustworthy forensic investigation framework","complex network system","dynamic mobile network system","digital forensics investigations","mobile infrastructures","IoV environment","IoV systems","trustworthy evidence","stored evidence","Internet of Vehicles","information sharing","clouds","sensors","distributed infrastructure","strong adversarial scenario"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Things (IoT)","Internet of Vehicles (IoV)","Security","Digital Forensics","Threat Model","Adversarial Scenario"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEEE.ICIOT.2017.13","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Congress on Internet of Things (ICIOT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Congress on Internet of Things (ICIOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8038295/8039037/08039051.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEE.ICIOT.2017.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8039037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trust-IoV: A Trustworthy Forensic Investigation Framework for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)","abstract":"The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a complex and dynamic mobile network system that enables information sharing between vehicles, their surrounding sensors, and clouds.

The existing tools and procedures of digital forensics cannot meet the highly distributed, decentralized, dynamic, and mobile infrastructures of the IoV. Forensic investigators will face challenges while identifying necessary pieces of evidence from the IoV environment, and collecting and analyzing the evidence. In this article, we propose TrustIoV - a digital forensic framework for the IoV systems that provides mechanisms to collect and store trustworthy evidence from the distributed infrastructure.

However, the complex hand gesture structure and various environment factors lead to low recognition rate. For instance, hand gesture depends on individuals, and different individuals' hands are with different sizes and postures, in addition, unconstrained environmental illumination also influences hand gesture recognition performance. Therefore, hand gesture recognition is still a challenging issue. This paper proposes a robust method for hand gesture recognition based on convolutional neural network, which is utilized to automatically extract the spatial and semantic feature of hand gesture. Our method consists of a modified Convolutional Neural Network structure and data preprocessing, which corporately increase hand gesture recognition performance. The experimental results on both Cambridge Hand Gesture Dataset and self-constructed dataset show that the proposed method is effective and competitive.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039082/","accessionNumber":"17190763","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8039082/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2017","conferenceDate":"2-4 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Robust Hand Gesture Recognition Method via Convolutional Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Hand Gesture Recognition Method via Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"4400a064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070052S","chronDate":"2-4 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"8034854","isNumber":"8038940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8034854","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8038940","articleId":"8039082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8039111,"authors":[{"name":"Yanan Mao","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanan","lastName":"Mao","id":"37086007645"},{"name":"Zuoquan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zuoquan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086007799"},{"name":"Dingyuan Fan","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, SouthWest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Dingyuan","lastName":"Fan","id":"37086010933"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4400-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4401-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8039111","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":344},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Support vector machines","Biological cells","Stock markets","Genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature selection","genetic algorithms","pattern classification","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid feature selection approach","single filter approaches","optimum feature selection","improved Genetic Algorithm","selection approaches","random selection","multiple population Genetic Algorithm","genetic operators","stock return prediction","filter feature selection approaches","IGA","optimum feature subset identification","classification accuracy","initial population generating operators","MPGA","A-shares data","Shanghai Stock Exchanges"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid feature selection","Improved genetic algorithm","Data mining","Stock market prediction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039111","abstract":"This paper proposes a hybrid feature selection approach based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) to predict stock return.

To overcome the threat of malicious spoofing attacks, we develop the Secure Location of Things (SLOT) framework which extends current state-of-the-art methods and is able to cope with such threats. The SLOT framework incorporates another piece of information which has not been utilized so far, the audibility information. This information indicates whether a node is able/unable to communicate with the target. By leveraging on this available information, we reformulate the location estimation problem as a stochastic censoring model and derive the maximum likelihood estimator for the node's location in two different ways: the first algorithm is based on a probabilistic mixture model and assumes knowledge of the Byzantine attack distributional model; and the second algorithm is based on a difference-timeof-arrival, which does not make any distributional assumptions regarding the attack. We show that our algorithms provide significant performance gain over current state-of-the-art algorithms, by mitigating the well-known ambiguity problem of the likelihood surface. Extensive simulations show the significant benefits that the SLOT framework provides compared to current state-of-the-art algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039153/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","volume":"4","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"17525632","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8039153/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Secure Location of Things (SLOT): Mitigating Localization Spoofing Attacks in the Internet of Things","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Location of Things (SLOT): Mitigating Localization Spoofing Attacks in the Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"jiot-zhang-2753579-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110859S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8172502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8172502","articleId":"8039153","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8039157,"authors":[{"name":"Il-Min Yi","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8241022/8039157/yi-2746698-small.gif","p":["Il-Min Yi received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic and electrical engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, South Korea, in 2007, 2010, and 2015, respectively.","From 2015 to 2016, he was a Post-Doctoral Researcher with POSTECH.

The TB RX consists of a voltage-to-time converter (VTC), a TB DFE, and a time comparator. The VTC converts the RX input voltage to a time difference between two VTC outputs by using the difference in clock-to-Q delays between two latches with different input offset voltages. The TB DFE inserts an additional delay to one of the two VTC outputs and bypasses the other VTC output to increase the time opening. The time comparator makes a decision with the first arriving edge of the two outputs of the TB DFE. While the feedback loop delay must be less than 1 UI for proper operation in the conventional voltage-based DFE, the TB DFE allows the feedback loop delay up to 1.43 UI in this paper. A transmitter (TX) transmits a single-ended signal of 200-mV swing by using an n-over-n voltage-mode driver. The transceiver in a 65-nm CMOS process achieves a 12.5 Gb/s with a 0.8-V supply through a 15-inch FR-4 channel of 14-dB loss. The TX and RX chip consume 4.3 and 3.4 mA, respectively.

The real-time pre-alarm for the instability of tailings dam is vital to ensure the normal mining and safety of human lives and properties. Based on the Internet of Things and wireless networks, the multiple and the key information system of tailings dam is constructed using the sensor data, which include the stability indexes like phreatic line, reservoir water level, internal and external deformation of the tailings dam. The cloud platform is applied to predict the future state of the phreatic line based on real-time monitoring data, where the equation of phreatic line can be obtained. The numerical simulation model is established by considering the predicted equation of phreatic line, limit equilibrium state parameters, reservoir water level, and rainfall. Then, the safety factor, random reliability, and interval non-probabilistic reliability can be solved out through the cloud platform. Combined with the trend of real-time monitoring deformation, as well as calculated dynamic safety factor, random reliability, and interval non-probabilistic reliability, the stable or dangerous warning signals of tailings dam can be obtained by the remote real-time pre-alarm system. The main solved method for the key parameters and pre-alarm process are presented through a case study. It is proved that the pre-alarm system is an efficient and real-time platform for the tailings dam stability with the integration and mutual validation of key information.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2753379","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

to reduce the high cost of the devices by performing inline deduplications. Unfortunately, existing software-based inline deduplications cannot achieve the devices' maximum throughput due to their high CPU utilization and power overhead. A recently proposed approach to perform device-wide deduplications inside each SSD can distribute the CPU overhead among multiple SSDs, but it also suffers from severely decreasing deduplication opportunities with the increasing number of SSDs deployed per node. Therefore, we propose a node-wide deduplication engine that relies on specialized hardware to perform two key steps of deduplication; data signature generation and table management. Our FPGA-based prototype detects all duplicates, and compared to software-based inline deduplication, it reduces the overall CPU utilization and power consumption by 93.6 and 20 percent respectively for a slow baseline and more for faster baselines.","doi":"10.1109/LCA.2017.2753258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8316264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCA.2017.2753258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/10208/8316264/08039166.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"50","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scalable HW-Based Inline Deduplication for SSD Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable HW-Based Inline Deduplication for SSD Arrays","volume":"17","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-June 1 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8039166/","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-June 2018","accessionNumber":"17633588","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039166/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning","grantNumber":"NRF-2015M3C4A7065647 and NRF-2017R1A2B3011038"},{"fundingName":"Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP)"},{"fundingName":"Korea government (MSIT)","grantNumber":"R0190-15-2012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable HW-Based Inline Deduplication for SSD Arrays","sourcePdf":"lca-ajdari-2753258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067083S","chronDate":"Jan.-June 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"10208","isNumber":"8316264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10208","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8316264","articleId":"8039166","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8039168,"authors":[{"name":"Jaime Laviada","affiliation":["Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Asturias, ES"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8039168/lavia-2753578-small.gif","p":["Jaime Laviada was born in Gij\u00f3n, Spain.

Thus, the complexity of these novel scanners is significantly reduced. Furthermore, sparsity is expected to enable embedding a conventional optical camera sensor inside the aperture of the scanner allowing a reduction of the scanner size. This camera sensor is used to build a complementary 3-D optical model as well as to estimate the millimeter-wave scanner position so that the imaging merging techniques can be applied. The approach is validated for concealed weapon detection by means of simulation as well as measurements, in which the scanner aperture is emulated by raster scan, showing a performance comparable to the case of dense arrays.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2753578","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08039168.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2753578","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"19259","endPage":"19268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multistatic Millimeter-Wave Imaging by Multiview Portable Camera","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039168","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multistatic Millimeter-Wave Imaging by Multiview Portable Camera","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039168/","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8039168/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17266509","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004837","fundingName":"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci\u00f3n of Spain/FEDER","grantNumber":"TEC2014-55290-JIN and TEC2014-54005-P"},{"fundingName":"Gobierno del Principado de Asturias (PCTI)/FEDER-FSE","grantNumber":"GRUPIN14-114"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007406","fundingName":"Ayudas Fundaci\u00f3n BBVA a Investigadores y Creadores Culturales 2016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multistatic Millimeter-Wave Imaging by Multiview Portable Camera","sourcePdf":"access-laviada-2753578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080247S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8039168","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8039172,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Lotfi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/8277196/8039172/lotfi-2753399-small.gif","p":["Ali Lotfi received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2004, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. (Hons.) degrees in electronics engineering from the Department of Electrical Engineering, RAZI University, Kermanshah, Iran, in 2010 and 2013, respectively.","He was with the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, as the Post-Doctoral Scholar Fellowship, from 2014 to 2016, where he involved in the development of high-efficiency switch-mode power amplifiers design, analysis and implementation.

This operation is defined as nonzero current switch (n-ZCS) and nonzero-derivative-current switch (n-ZDCS) conditions. The generalized design equations as a function of design specifications, load resistance, and a given dc-supply voltage are derived. Two degrees of the design freedom achieved thanks to n-ZCS and n-ZDCS that are utilized for the simultaneous satisfaction of design specifications, such as peak-switch-voltage and peak-switch-current along with a given load resistance. The output power capability is affected by n-ZCS and n-ZDCS conditions, which can be obtained in the desired value using the controlled adjustment of introduced deviation parameters. In order to prove the validity of the proposed design methodology, an inverse class-E PA operating in 2 GHz with output power of 23 dBm is implemented in 0.25-\u03bcm AlGaAs-InGaAs pHEMT technology.

The framework is motivated by the need for efficient and accurate video processing in a wide variety of systems for air and ground environments. This framework, called LDspectral, is designed to incorporate selection of subsets of bands as a core, front-end step in the video processing process. Band subset selection opens up a large design space for data-driven adaptation that influences key metrics, including accuracy and computational efficiency. We have demonstrated a prototype implementation of LDspectral applied to a background subtraction application. Through experiments with LDSpectral on a relevant data set, we have demonstrated the utility of flexible, optimized BSS in the navigation of operational trade-offs for multispectral video processing systems. The current version of LDspectral is developed for input streams in which the multispectral images are well aligned across the different bands. The band subset processing subsystem in LDspectral can readily be extended to incorporate image registration, which would be useful to extend the capabilities of the overall system to handle images that are not aligned. Such extension together with the integrated optimization of associated operational tradeoffs is a useful direction for future work.","doi":"10.1109/MAES.2017.160132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAES.2017.160132","startPage":"50","endPage":"57","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/62/8039177/08039188.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8039177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic, data-driven processing of multispectral video streams","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic, data-driven processing of multispectral video streams","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2017","volume":"32","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8039188/","accessionNumber":"17192780","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039188/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic, data-driven processing of multispectral video streams","sourcePdf":"50-57_aesm-32-06-50.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098071S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"62","isNumber":"8039177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"62","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8039177","articleId":"8039188","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8039196,"authors":[{"name":"Tushar","affiliation":["Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/8263327/8039196/tusha-2753719-small.gif","p":["Tushar (S\u201914) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical\n engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, India, in 2011, and the master's degree in\n electrical engineering from Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA, in 2015, where he is currently working\n toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","From 2011 to 2013, he was at Siemens, Gurgaon, India, where he designed substations and was in the Relay Setting\n Group.

A novel adaptive search-based algorithm to estimate load model parameters is presented here. In this paper, a static load model is used with the Z (constant impedance), I (constant current), and P (constant power) components of the load. Developed estimation algorithms for the ZIP parameter estimation are validated using the IEEE 14-bus system and data provided by the industry collaborators.

Consumer concerns over the limited availability of charging facilities and unacceptably long charging periods are major factors behind this low penetration rate. From the perspective of the electricity grid, a longer PEV peak load period can potentially overlap with the residential peak load period, making energy management more challenging. A suitably designed charging strategy can help to address these concerns, which motivated us to conduct this research. In this paper, we present a smart charging strategy for a PEV network that offers multiple charging options, including ac level 2 charging, dc fast charging, and battery swapping facilities at charging stations. For a PEV requiring charging facilities, we model the issue of finding the optimal charging station as a multiobjective optimization problem, where the goal is to find a station that ensures the minimum charging time, travel time, and charging cost. We extend the model to a metaheuristic solution in the form of an ant colony optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed solution significantly reduces waiting time and charging cost.","doi":"10.1109/TTE.2017.2753403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687316/8288747/08039201.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8288747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TTE.2017.2753403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Charging Strategy for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Smart Charging Strategy for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039201/","publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17633525","htmlLink":"/document/8039201/","volume":"4","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Charging Strategy for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations","sourcePdf":"tte-moghaddam-2753403-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122651S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6687316","isNumber":"8288747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687316","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"8288747","articleId":"8039201","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8039203,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Ma","affiliation":["Origin Wireless Communications Inc., College Park, MD, USA","Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8258580/8039203/ma-2753253-small.gif","p":["Hang Ma (M\u201917) received the B.S. degree in information engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, USA, in 2016.

Although the basic TR waveforms are simple to use, and they cannot provide the optimal performance in some cases. Since the C-RAN is usually expected to serve massive wireless devices, the severe inter-user interference will limit the performance of the system, especially in the high signal-to-noise ratio region where the interference power dominates the noise power. In this paper, we propose to optimize both downlink and uplink transmissions in the TR-based C-RAN so as to alleviate the interference. In the downlink transmission, an optimal content-aware waveform design is proposed, so that the baseband units (BBUs) are able to combine both the channel information and the content information to suppress the interference. In the uplink transmission, an optimal receiver design algorithm is proposed, such that the BBUs can detect the symbols transmitted by the terminal devices more accurately by leveraging the channel information. We study the bit error rate performance of the proposed algorithms based on extensive measurements of the wireless channel in a real-world environment. Numerical results demonstrate the significant performance improvement over the basic TR transmission techniques and the traditional waveform design techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2753253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2753253","startPage":"382","endPage":"393","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8258580/08039203.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8258580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveforming Optimizations for Time-Reversal Cloud Radio Access Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Waveforming Optimizations for Time-Reversal Cloud Radio Access Networks","volume":"66","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17519937","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8039203/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveforming Optimizations for Time-Reversal Cloud Radio Access Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-ma-2753253-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097371S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8258580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8258580","articleId":"8039203","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8039204,"authors":[{"name":"Ugo Rosolia","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/8395242/8039204/rosol-2753460-small.gif","p":["Ugo Rosolia received the B.S. and M.S.

A joint optimization of subcarrier pairing and power allocation is formulated as a mixed-integer nonconvex problem, with the objective to minimize the transmit power of the base station and the relay (strong UE) under the quality of service requirements of both UEs. We first explore the inherent property of power allocation for a single subcarrier pair. Then, in light of the property, we employ the Lagrange dual method and the Hungarian algorithm, in an asymptotically optimal manner, to solve the joint subcarrier pairing and power allocation problem.

We investigate a low-complexity WPT scheme based on the retrodirective beamforming technique, where all ERs send a common beacon signal simultaneously to the ET in the uplink and the ET simply conjugates and amplifies its received sum-signal and transmits to all ERs in the downlink for WPT. We show that such a low-complexity scheme achieves the massive multiple-input multiple-output energy beamforming gain. However, a \u201cdoubly near-far\u201d issue exists due to the round-trip (uplink beacon and downlink WPT) signal propagation loss where the harvested power of a far ER from the ET can be significantly lower than that of a near ER if the same uplink beacon power is used. To tackle this problem, we propose a distributed uplink beacon power update algorithm, where each ER independently adjusts the beacon power based on its current harvested power in an iterative manner. It is shown that the proposed algorithm converges quickly to a unique fixed-point solution, which helps achieve the desired user fairness with best efforts.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/8293945/08039212.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"57","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2017.2753259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2017.2753259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8293945","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Retrodirective Multi-User Wireless Power Transfer With Massive MIMO","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Erbium","Uplink","MIMO","Downlink","Training","Radio frequency","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","energy harvesting","inductive power transmission","iterative methods","MIMO communication","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity WPT scheme","retrodirective beamforming technique","common beacon signal","received sum-signal","low-complexity scheme","distributed uplink beacon power update algorithm","desired user fairness","retrodirective multiuser wireless power transfer","massive MIMO","radio-frequency multiuser wireless power transfer system","energy transmitter","multiple distributed energy receivers","massive multiple-input multiple-output energy beamforming gain","round-trip signal propagation loss"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless power transfer","retrodirective transmission","energy beamforming","massive MIMO","distributed power control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Retrodirective Multi-User Wireless Power Transfer With Massive MIMO","volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8039212/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17595978","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retrodirective Multi-User Wireless Power Transfer With Massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"lwc-zeng-2753259-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088889S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8293945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8293945","articleId":"8039212","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8039215,"authors":[{"name":"Yusuf Aytar","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/8454009/8039215/aytar-2753232-small.gif","p":["Yusuf Aytar received the MSc degree from the University of Central\n Florida (UCF) and the DPhil degree from the University of Oxford.

In this paper, we investigate how to learn cross-modal scene representations that transfer across modalities. To study this problem, we introduce a new cross-modal scene dataset. While convolutional neural networks can categorize scenes well, they also learn an intermediate representation not aligned across modalities, which is undesirable for cross-modal transfer applications. We present methods to regularize cross-modal convolutional neural networks so that they have a shared representation that is agnostic of the modality. Our experiments suggest that our scene representation can help transfer representations across modalities for retrieval. Moreover, our visualizations suggest that units emerge in the shared representation that tend to activate on consistent concepts independently of the modality.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/8454009/08039215.pdf","startPage":"2303","endPage":"2314","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2753232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2753232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8454009","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Modal Scene Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Visualization","Art","Automobiles","Data models","Adaptation models","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","feedforward neural nets","image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural image","convolutional neural networks","scene representation","cross-modal scene dataset","cross-modal scene networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-modal perception","domain adaptation","scene understanding"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/34/8454009/8039215-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Modal Scene Networks","volume":"40","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8039215/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18094716","pubMedId":"28922114","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIS-1524817"},{"fundingName":"Google faculty research award"},{"fundingName":"Google PhD fellowship to C.V.

In this paper, we propose to learn a deep convolutional neural network for extracting sharp edges from blurred images. Motivated by the success of the existing filtering-based deblurring methods, the proposed model consists of two stages: suppressing extraneous details and enhancing sharp edges. We show that the two-stage model simplifies the learning process and effectively restores sharp edges. Facilitated by the learned sharp edges, the proposed deblurring algorithm does not require any coarse-to-fine strategy or edge selection, thereby significantly simplifying kernel estimation and reducing computation load. Extensive experimental results on challenging blurry images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world images in terms of visual quality and run-time.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8071125/08039224.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"205","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2753658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2753658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8071125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Blur Kernel Estimation via Deep Learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Image restoration","Kernel","Estimation","Computational modeling","Training data","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","image filtering","image restoration","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion blur kernel estimation","deep learning","state-of-the-art deblurring methods","coarse-to-fine kernel estimation process","deep convolutional neural network","blurred images","learning process","learned sharp edges","deblurring algorithm","coarse-to-fine strategy","simplifying kernel estimation","state-of-the-art methods","filtering-based deblurring methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind image deblurring","kernel estimation","deep convolutional neural network","sharp edges"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/83/8071125/8039224-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Motion Blur Kernel Estimation via Deep Learning","volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8039224/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17303992","pubMedId":"28922121","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF CAREER","grantNumber":"1149783"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSF of China","grantNumber":"61673234, 61732007 and U1636124"},{"fundingName":"973 Program of China","grantNumber":"2014CB347600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"NSF of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20140058"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB1001001"},{"fundingName":"Adobe"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007065","fundingName":"Nvidia"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Motion Blur Kernel Estimation via Deep Learning","sourcePdf":"tip-yang-2753658-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104464S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8071125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"8071125","articleId":"8039224","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8039231,"authors":[{"name":"Gerard Pons","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165369/8453974/8039231/pons-2753235-small.gif","p":["Gerard Pons received the graduated degree in computer science\n engineering, the master's degree in industrial, automation, and computer systems from both the University of\n Girona (Spain), in 2009 and 2010, respectively, and the PhD degree from the University of Girona, in 2014.

Although recent methods achieve close to human accuracy in controlled scenarios, the recognition of emotions in the wild remains a challenging problem. Recent advances in Deep learning have supposed a significant breakthrough in many computer vision tasks, including facial expression analysis. Particularly, the use of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks has attained the best results in the recent public challenges. The current state-of-the-art algorithms suggest that the use of ensembles of CNNs can outperform individual CNN classifiers. Two key considerations influence these results: (i) The design of CNNs involves the adjustment of parameters that allow diversity and complementarity in the partial classification results, and (ii) the final classification rule that assembles the result of the committee. In this paper we propose to improve the assembling of the committee by introducing supervised learning on the ensemble computation. We train a CNN on the posterior-class probabilities resulting from the individual members allowing to capture non-linear dependencies among committee members, and to learn this combination from data. The validation shows an accuracy 5 percent higher with respect to previous state-of-the art results based on averaging classifiers, and 4 percent to the majority voting rule.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervised Committee of Convolutional Neural Networks in Automated Facial Expression Analysis","doi":"10.1109/TAFFC.2017.2753235","startPage":"343","endPage":"350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAFFC.2017.2753235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8453974","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165369/8453974/08039231.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"Supervised Committee of Convolutional Neural Networks in Automated Facial Expression Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8039231/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2018","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18062632","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness","grantNumber":"TIN2015-66951-C2-2-R"},{"fundingName":"NVIDIA Hardware"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised Committee of Convolutional Neural Networks in Automated Facial Expression Analysis","sourcePdf":"taffc-pons-2753235-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089857S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"8453974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8453974","articleId":"8039231","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8039234,"authors":[{"name":"Yifeng Zheng","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","City University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/8960487/8039234/zheng-2753245-small.gif","p":["Yifeng Zheng received the BE degree in information engineering from South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2013.

It refers to the procedure for estimating the unknown user reliability from collected sensory data and inferring truthful information via reliability-aware data aggregation. Though widely studied in the plaintext domain, truth discovery remains largely under-explored in privacy-aware mobile crowdsensing. Existing works either do not consider user reliability issue or fall short of achieving practical cost efficiency, due to iterative transmission and computation over large ciphertexts from homomorphic cryptosystem. In this paper, we propose two new privacy-aware crowdsensing designs with truth discovery that significantly improve the bandwidth and computation performance on individual users. Our insight is to identify the core atomic operation in the iterative truth discovery procedure, and carefully craft security designs accordingly to enable efficient truth discovery in the ciphertext domain. Our first design is highly customized for the single-server setting, while our second design under the two-server model further shifts most of user workloads to the cloud server side. Both our designs protect individual sensory data and reliability degrees throughout the truth discovery procedure. Experiments show that compared with the prior result, our designs gain at least 30x and 10x savings on user communication and computation, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2017.2753245","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/8858/8960487/08039234.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8960487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2017.2753245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-Aware and Efficient Mobile Crowdsensing with Truth Discovery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2020","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-Aware and Efficient Mobile Crowdsensing with Truth Discovery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039234/","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19267187","htmlLink":"/document/8039234/","volume":"17","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"CityU 11276816, CityU 11212717 and CityU C1008-16G"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003452","fundingName":"Innovation and Technology Commission","grantNumber":"ITS/307/15"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572412"},{"fundingName":"AWS Education Research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-Aware and Efficient Mobile Crowdsensing with Truth Discovery","sourcePdf":"tdsc-wang-2753245-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179878S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"8960487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8960487","articleId":"8039234","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8039236,"authors":[{"name":"Dogan Corus","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/8478014/8039236/corus-2753538-small.gif","p":["Dogan Corus received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in industrial engineering from Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K., under the supervision of P.

Most rigorous results were derived using a handful of key analytic techniques, including drift analysis. However, since few of these techniques apply effortlessly to population-based EAs, most time complexity results concern simple EAs, such as the (1+1) EA. We present the level-based theorem, a new technique tailored to population-based processes. It applies to any nonelitist process where offspring are sampled independently from a distribution depending only on the current population. Given conditions on this distribution, our technique provides upper bounds on the expected time until the process reaches a target state. The technique is demonstrated on pseudo-Boolean functions, the sorting problem, and approximation of optimal solutions in combinatorial optimization. The conditions of the theorem are often straightforward to verify, even for genetic algorithms and estimation of distribution algorithms which were considered highly nontrivial to analyze. The proofs for the example applications are available in the supplementary materials. Finally, we prove that the theorem is nearly optimal for the processes considered. Given the information the theorem requires about the process, a much tighter bound cannot be proved.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2017.2753538","startPage":"707","endPage":"719","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/8478014/08039236.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2017.2753538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8478014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Level-Based Analysis of Genetic Algorithms and Other Search Processes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sociology","Statistics","Genetic algorithms","Runtime","Algorithm design and analysis","Upper bound","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","combinatorial mathematics","computational complexity","evolutionary computation","genetic algorithms","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution algorithms","level-based analysis","evolutionary algorithms","parameter settings","fitness landscapes","fundamental problem","evolutionary computation","key analytic techniques","level-based theorem","population-based processes","nonelitist process","pseudoBoolean functions","sorting problem","optimal solutions","combinatorial optimization","genetic algorithms","population-based EA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximation","estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA)","genetic algorithm (GA)","runtime analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039236/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Level-Based Analysis of Genetic Algorithms and Other Search Processes","volume":"22","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8039236/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18129897","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013, SAGE)","grantNumber":"618091"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002261","fundingName":"Russian Foundation for Basic Research","grantNumber":"15-01-00785 and 16-01-00740"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Level-Based Analysis of Genetic Algorithms and Other Search Processes","sourcePdf":"tevc-lehre-2753538-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162063S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"8478014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8478014","articleId":"8039236","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8039237,"authors":[{"name":"Hamdan Awan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7728/8264912/8039237/awan-2753230-small.gif","p":["Hamdan Awan (S\u201914) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila, Pakistan, in 2011 and 2013, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Australia, in 2017.

The key contribution is we show that enzymatic reaction cycles, which is a class of chemical reactions commonly found in cells consisting of a forward and a backward enzymatic reaction, can improve the capacity of the communication link. The technical difficulty in analyzing enzymatic reaction cycles is that their reaction rates are nonlinear. We deal with this by assuming that the amount of certain chemicals in the enzymatic reaction cycle is large. In order to simplify the problem further, we use singular perturbation to study a particular operating regime of the enzymatic reaction cycles. This allows us to derive a closed-form expression of the channel gain. This expression suggests that we can improve the channel gain by increasing the total amount of substrate in the enzymatic reaction cycle. By using numerical calculations, we show that the effect of the enzymatic reaction cycle is to increase the channel gain and to reduce the noise, which results in a better signal-to-noise ratio and in turn a higher communication capacity. Furthermore, we show that we can increase the capacity by increasing the total amount of substrate in the enzymatic reaction cycle.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728/8264912/08039237.pdf","startPage":"744","endPage":"754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2017.2753230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2017.2753230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8264912","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the Capacity of Molecular Communication Using Enzymatic Reaction Cycles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Molecular communication","Transmitters","Signal to noise ratio","Substrates","Biochemistry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","biodiffusion","cellular biophysics","enzymes","molecular biophysics","molecular communication (telecommunication)","nanobiotechnology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diffusion-based molecular communication link","chemical reactions","enzymatic reaction cycles","cells","singular perturbation","signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Molecular communication","communication capacity","chemical reaction based receiver","enzymatic reaction cycles","signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computers, Molecular","Enzymes","Nanotechnology","Signal-To-Noise Ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Improving the Capacity of Molecular Communication Using Enzymatic Reaction Cycles","volume":"16","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8039237/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17490278","pubMedId":"28922124","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the Capacity of Molecular Communication Using Enzymatic Reaction Cycles","sourcePdf":"tnb-awan-2753230-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068279S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"8264912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8264912","articleId":"8039237","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8039241,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Al-Qurishi","affiliation":["Department of Information System, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"p":["Muhammad Al-Qurishi (S\u201916) received the Master's degree in\n information systems from King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Without understanding the contextual background, it is impractical to differentiate among various groups in terms of their relevance and mutual relations, or to identify the most significant representatives from the community at large. In this paper, we propose an integrated social media content analysis platform that leverages three levels of features, i.e., user-generated content, social graph connections, and user profile activities, to analyze and detect anomalous behaviors that deviate significantly from the norm in large-scale social networks. Several types of analyses have been conducted for a better understanding of the different user behaviors in the detection of highly adaptive malicious users. We attempted a novel approach regarding the process of data extraction and classification to contextualize large-scale networks in a proper manner. We also collected a significant number of user profiles from Twitter and YouTube, along with around 13 million channel activities. Extensive evaluations were conducted on real-world datasets of user activities for both social networks. The evaluation results show the effectiveness and utility of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2753202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8279661/08039241.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2753202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8279661","startPage":"799","endPage":"813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging Analysis of User Behavior to Identify Malicious Activities in Large-Scale Social Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging Analysis of User Behavior to Identify Malicious Activities in Large-Scale Social Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039241/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17574237","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8039241/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","grantNumber":"RG-228"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging Analysis of User Behavior to Identify Malicious Activities in Large-Scale Social Networks","sourcePdf":"tii-hossain-2753202-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116337S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8279661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8279661","articleId":"8039241","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8039242,"authors":[{"name":"Liwei An","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, CN"],"firstName":"Liwei","lastName":"An","orcid":"0000-0002-9184-9848","id":"37086108120"},{"name":"Guang-Hong Yang","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, CN"],"firstName":"Guang-Hong","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-8911-0112","id":"37290182400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"8039242","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1427},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Actuators","Linear systems","System performance","Optimization","Security","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","matrix algebra","probability","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system performance","system matrices","attack goal","multiobjective adaptive dynamic programming method","attack scenarios","data-driven cyber attacks","adaptive L2-gain optimal theory","data-driven coordinated attack policy design","sensor-actuator coordinated attack policy","\u03b1-probability L2 stealthiness","stealth capabilities","data-based L2-gain composite optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cyber-physical systems","data driven","cyber attacks","  $\\mathcal {L}_2$  -gain composite optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039242","abstract":"Data-driven cyber attacks are more practical than the existing model-based ones.

This sensing device is based on the combination of passive infrared sensors (PIRs) and ultrasonic rangefinder, and is used for real-time vehicle detection, classification, and speed estimation in the context of wireless sensor networks. This framework relies on dynamic Bayesian Networks to fuse heterogeneous data both spatially and temporally for vehicle detection. To estimate the speed of the incoming vehicles, we first use cross correlation and wavelet transform-based methods to estimate the time delay between the signals of different sensors. We then propose a calibration and self-correction model based on Bayesian Networks to make a joint inference by all sensors about the speed and the length of the detected vehicle. Furthermore, we use the measurements of the ultrasonic and the PIR sensors to perform vehicle classification. Validation data (using an experimental dual infrared and ultrasonic traffic sensor) show a 99% accuracy in vehicle detection, a mean error of 5 kph in vehicle speed estimation, a mean error of 0.7m in vehicle length estimation, and a high accuracy in vehicle classification. Finally, we discuss the computational performance of the algorithm, and show that this framework can be implemented on low-power computational devices within a wireless sensor network setting. Such decentralized processing greatly improves the energy consumption of the system and minimizes bandwidth usage.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2017.2727224","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/8353201/08039243.pdf","startPage":"1593","endPage":"1606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8353201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2017.2727224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Classification and Speed Estimation Using Combined Passive Infrared/Ultrasonic Sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Classification and Speed Estimation Using Combined Passive Infrared/Ultrasonic Sensors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039243/","publicationDate":"May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17736826","htmlLink":"/document/8039243/","volume":"19","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle Classification and Speed Estimation Using Combined Passive Infrared/Ultrasonic Sensors","sourcePdf":"tits-odat-2727224-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136727S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"8353201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8353201","articleId":"8039243","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8039245,"authors":[{"name":"Qingshuang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qingshuang","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0003-1879-5553","id":"37085341337"},{"name":"Aijun Liu","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Aijun","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0001-7235-9424","id":"38183373700"},{"name":"Xiaofei Pan","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Pan","id":"37085611581"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8039245","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":605},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probabilistic logic","Hamming weight","Estimation","Decoding","Complexity theory","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hamming codes","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced probabilistic computation method","polar codes","uniform distribution assumption","short polar code","estimated HWD","weight distribution","Hamming weight distribution","codeword","time 1.0 s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polar codes","Hamming weight distribution","probabilistic computation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039245","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8170462/08039245.pdf","startPage":"2562","endPage":"2565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2753222","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2753222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Enhanced Probabilistic Computation Method for the Weight Distribution of Polar Codes","abstract":"Owning to the explicit structure, Hamming weight distribution (HWD) of polar codes with large length can be recursively computed with that of the short one.

Meanwhile, some characteristics for the HWD of polar codes are discussed and used to avoid the unnecessary calculations. Simulation results show that the estimated HWD matches the exact one well for rate larger than 0.5.

The proposed NGD circuit based on a distributed amplifier (DA) is insensitive to the biasing voltage level. By adjusting the characteristic impedances of input and output transmission lines of the DA at different stages, NGD characteristics can be realized under the same bias. This results in the fact that only one single bias voltage is needed for the gate to meet the required transfer function between the reversed and input port to synthesize NGD. More importantly, the NGD is no longer sensitive to the transistor's bias voltage, which lays an important foundation for practical applications. The measured results show that, under various bias conditions, the circuit can provide -1 ns group delay level within 0.13-GHz NGD bandwidth. In addition, the gain of the proposed NGD circuit is configurable by adjusting the bias level.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8097137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2017.2750062","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/8097137/08039249.pdf","startPage":"1007","endPage":"1009","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2017.2750062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage-Insensitive Negative Group Delay Circuit Based on a Stepped-Impedance Distributed Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Voltage-Insensitive Negative Group Delay Circuit Based on a Stepped-Impedance Distributed Amplifier","volume":"27","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8039249/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17352736","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039249/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage-Insensitive Negative Group Delay Circuit Based on a Stepped-Impedance Distributed Amplifier","sourcePdf":"lmwc-wu-2750062-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047906S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"8097137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8097137","articleId":"8039249","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":8039253,"authors":[{"name":"Konpal Shaukat Ali","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Divison, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8039253/ali-2753380-small.gif","p":["Konpal Shaukat Ali (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan, in 2012, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia, in 2014, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.

As the name implies, NOMA operation introduces intracell interference (i.e., interference arising within the cell) to the cellular operation. The intracell interference is managed by careful NOMA design (e.g., user clustering and resource allocation) along with successive interference cancellation. However, most of the proposed NOMA designs are agnostic to intercell interference (i.e., interference from outside the cell), which is a major performance limiting parameter in 5G networks. This paper sheds light on the drastic negativeimpact of intercell interference on the NOMA performance and advocates interference-aware NOMA design that jointly accounts for both intracell and intercell interference. To this end, a case study for fair NOMA operation is presented and intercell interference mitigation techniques for NOMA networks are discussed. This paper also investigates the potential of integrating NOMA with two important 5G transmission schemes, namely, full duplex and device-to-device communication. This is important since the ambitious performance defined by the third generation partnership project for 5G is foreseen to be realized via seamless integration of several new technologies and transmission techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2753380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2753380","startPage":"21204","endPage":"21216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08039253.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for Large-Scale 5G Networks: Interference Aware Design","topic":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for 5G Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039253/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for Large-Scale 5G Networks: Interference Aware Design","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17515797","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/8039253/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for Large-Scale 5G Networks: Interference Aware Design","sourcePdf":"access-ali-2753380-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088847S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for 5G Systems"],"articleId":"8039253","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8039259,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Acito","affiliation":["Dipartimento Armi Navali, Accademia Navale, Livorno, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/62/8039193/8039259/8039259-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["N.

In this paper, we consider the specific problem of anomalous change detection (ACD) in hyperspectral images and discuss how images taken at two different times can be processed to detect changes caused by insertion, deletion, or displacement of small objects in the monitored scene. We introduce the ACD problem using an approach based on the statistical decision theory and we derive a common framework including different ACD approaches. Far from being inclusive of all the methods proposed in the literature, this tutorial overview places emphasis on techniques based on the multivariate Gaussian model that allows a formal presentation of the ACD problem and the rigorous derivation of the possible solutions in a way that is both mathematically more tractable and easier to interpret. The unification of different approaches under a single rigorous statistical scheme provides both a tutorial overview of ACD techniques, and a useful instrument for researchers already familiar with the ACD problem. Dedicated preprocessing methods aimed at improving the robustness of the ACD process are also discussed. Real data are exploited to test and compare the presented methods, highlighting advantages and drawbacks of each approach. The tutorial aspect of the paper has suggested the use of a freely available data set. This should hopefully motivate the interested reader to experiment with the processing methods and performance evaluation chain presented herein.","doi":"10.1109/MAES.2017.160155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/62/8039193/08039259.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAES.2017.160155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8039193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introductory view of anomalous change detection in hyperspectral images within a theoretical gaussian framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039259/","displayDocTitle":"Introductory view of anomalous change detection in hyperspectral images within a theoretical gaussian framework","volume":"32","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17192777","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8039259/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introductory view of anomalous change detection in hyperspectral images within a theoretical gaussian framework","sourcePdf":"02-27_aesm-32-07s-02.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151141S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"62","isNumber":"8039193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"62","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8039193","articleId":"8039259","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8039260,"authors":[{"name":"Jordi Vila-Valls","affiliation":["Statistical Inference for Communications and Positioning, Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/62/8039193/8039260/8039260-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dr. Jordi Vil\u00e0-Valls is a Researcher at the Statistical Inference for Communications and Positioning Department (SI), Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC/CERCA).

A tutorial on kalman filter-based techniques for digital carrier synchronization","abstract":"Carrier synchronization is a fundamental stage in the receiver side of any communication or positioning system. Traditional carrier phase tracking techniques are based on well-known phase-locked loop (PLL) closed-loop architectures, which are still the methods of choice in modern receivers. Those techniques are well understood, easy to tune, and perform well under benign propagation conditions, but their applicability is seriously compromised in harsh propagation environments, where the signal may be affected by high dynamics, shadowing, strong fadings, multipath effects, or ionospheric scintillation. From an optimal filtering standpoint, the Kalman filter (KF) is clearly a powerful alternative, but the synchronization community seems still reluctant to exploit all the potential it has to offer. The purpose of this article is twofold: i) to review the basics and state of the art on both PLL and KF-based tracking techniques and ii) to present and justify the reasoning behind the systematic use of KF-based tracking approaches instead of the well-established PLL-based architectures from both theoretical and practical points of view. To support the discussion, two specific scenarios of interest to the aerospace community are numerically evaluated: robust carrier tracking of global navigation satellite systems' signals and synchronization in a deep space communications system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039260/","volume":"32","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8039260/","accessionNumber":"17192775","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Are PLLs dead?

We undertake an asymptotic performance analysis with respect to three CSI conditions, which ensures to provide a comprehensive insight into the achievable diversity and coding gains as well as the impact of various CSI uncertainties on the SEP performance. The SEP performance comparison between the ML and GD is obtained under different CSI uncertainties. This interestingly reveals that the GD can achieve nearly optimal error performance as the M-ary modulation size is large or even outperforms the ML under certain CSI conditions.

A simple low-pass filter based circuit is used to obtain the commutation points through the virtual third-harmonic back EMF. After that, an FN-PLL is applied to obtain continuous rotor position angles. On this basis, the SFF-based compensation is proposed to compensate the detecting error adaptively. Meanwhile, the field vector control loop for surface PM motor is proposed, which is based on the proposed rotor position detection link and compensation link. An experimental high-speed magnetically suspended blower platform is built.

However, in remote, rural, and disaster affected areas, it is difficult to construct such wireless networks due to the unavailability or inadequacy of cellular infrastructures. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be a good candidate to promptly construct the D2D-enabled wireless network. However, the assignment of the radio channels of the nodes (i.e., UAVs and user terminals) is challenging due to the availability of only a limited number of orthogonal channels and the interference issue resulted from using arbitrary channels. Furthermore, the dynamic topology and high mobility of nodes in such a combined UAV and D2D-based network make conventional channel assignment (CA) algorithm no longer suitable. In this paper, we formally address this problem, and demonstrate how partially overlapping channels (POCs) and game theory can be exploited to alleviate the problem. In this vein, we propose a distributed anticoordination game based POC assignment algorithm referred to as AC-POCA. In our proposed AC-POCA, the nodes use only local information to play the game, and reach a steady state, uniqueness of which is verified through analysis. Also, the upper bound of AC-POCA (i.e., price of anarchy) is analytically evaluated, which is corroborated by simulation results. In addition, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AC-POCA in terms of good throughput and low signaling overhead in a dynamic environment.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2753280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2753280","startPage":"1672","endPage":"1683","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8290782/08039268.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8290782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AC-POCA: Anticoordination Game Based Partially Overlapping Channels Assignment in Combined UAV and D2D-Based Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"AC-POCA: Anticoordination Game Based Partially Overlapping Channels Assignment in Combined UAV and D2D-Based Networks","volume":"67","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","accessionNumber":"17577966","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8039268/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AC-POCA: Anticoordination Game Based Partially Overlapping Channels Assignment in Combined UAV and D2D-Based Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-tang-2753280-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136761S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8290782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"8290782","articleId":"8039268","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8039274,"authors":[{"name":"Morteza Nabavi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8271882/8039274/nabav-2747151-small.gif","p":["Morteza Nabavi (M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2008, the M.A.Sc. degree in computer engineering from Boston University, Boston, MA, USA, and the M.A.Sc. degree in electronics from Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada, in 2012.

Utilizing pMOS access transistor results in lower zero-level degradation (ZLD) and, hence, higher read stability. In addition, the access transistor connected to the internal node holding VDD acts as a stabilizer and counter balances the effect of ZLD. In order to improve the writability, wordline (WL) boosting is exploited. WL boosting also helps to compensate the lower speed of the pMOS access transistor compared with nMOS transistor. To verify our design, a 2-kb SRAM is fabricated in the TSMC 65-nm CMOS technology. Measurement results show that the maximum operational frequency of the test chip is at 3.34 MHz at 290 mV. The minimum energy consumption is measured as 1.1 fJ/bit at 400 mV.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8271882","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/8271882/08039274.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2017.2747151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2017.2747151","startPage":"656","endPage":"667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 290-mV, 3.34-MHz, 6T SRAM With pMOS Access Transistors and Boosted Wordline in 65-nm CMOS Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039274/","displayDocTitle":"A 290-mV, 3.34-MHz, 6T SRAM With pMOS Access Transistors and Boosted Wordline in 65-nm CMOS Technology","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8039274/","volume":"53","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"17524284","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"NSERC-RGPIN-205034-2012 052714"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 290-mV, 3.34-MHz, 6T SRAM With pMOS Access Transistors and Boosted Wordline in 65-nm CMOS Technology","sourcePdf":"jssc-nabavi-2747151-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050747S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"8271882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8271882","articleId":"8039274","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8039282,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8299601/8039282/li-2730260-small.gif","p":["Ke Li (M\u201914) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical\n engineering from the Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively, and the Eng.\n degree from the Ecole Centrale de Marseille, Marseille, France, in 2011.

This increase is a function of the applied dc bias when the device is in its off state, and the time which the device is biased for. Thus, dynamic RDS(on) of different commercial GaN-HEMTs are characterised at different bias voltages in the paper by a proposed new measurement circuit. The time-constants associated with trapping and detrapping effects in the device are extracted using the proposed circuit and it is shown that variations in RDS(on) can be predicted using a series of RC circuit networks. A new methodology for integrating these RDS(on) predictions into existing gallium nitride-high-electron-mobility transistors models in standard SPICE simulators to improve model accuracy is then presented. Finally, device dynamic RDS(on) values of the model is compared and validated with the measurement when it switches in a power converter with different duty cycles and switching voltages.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8299601/08039282.pdf","startPage":"5262","endPage":"5273","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2730260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2730260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8299601","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterisation and Modeling of Gallium Nitride Power Semiconductor Devices Dynamic On-State Resistance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage measurement","Gallium nitride","Current measurement","Integrated circuit modeling","Electrical resistance measurement","Clamps","HEMTs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","power HEMT","RC circuits","semiconductor device models","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gallium Nitride Power Semiconductor Devices Dynamic On-State Resistance","trapping effects","applied dc bias","measurement circuit","time-constants","detrapping effects","RC circuit networks","gallium nitride-high-electron-mobility transistors models","device dynamic RDS","switching voltages","HEMTs","bias voltages","duty cycles","standard SPICE simulators","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic on-state resistance","equivalent circuit","gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors (GaN-HEMT)","power semiconductor device characterisation","power semiconductor device modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Characterisation and Modeling of Gallium Nitride Power Semiconductor Devices Dynamic On-State Resistance","volume":"33","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8039282/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17596346","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/K014471/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Characterisation and Modeling of Gallium Nitride Power Semiconductor Devices Dynamic On-State Resistance","sourcePdf":"tpel-li-2730260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131862S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8299601","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8299601","articleId":"8039282","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8039289,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Quintero","affiliation":["Universidad del Cauca, Popay\u00e1n, Cauca, Colombia","Laboratoire CITI (a joint laboratory between the Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, INSA de Lyon, and INRIA), Villeurbanne, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8291762/8039289/quint-2753252-small.gif","p":["Victor Quintero received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electronics and telecommunications engineering from Universidad del Cauca, Popay\u00e1n, Colombia, in 1999 and 2011, respectively.

The model is based on a statistical approach and developed to provide a realistic conservative RF exposure assessment for a significant proportion of all possible downlink exposure scenarios (95th percentile) in-line with requirements in a recently developed International Electrotechnical Commission standard for RF EMF exposure assessments of RBS. Factors, such as RBS utilization, time-division duplex, scheduling time, and spatial distribution of users within a cell are considered. The model is presented in terms of a closed-form equation. For an example scenario corresponding to an expected 5G RBS product, the largest realistic maximum power level was found to be less than 15% of the corresponding theoretical maximum. For far-field exposure scenarios, this corresponds to a reduction in RF EMF limit compliance distance with a factor of about 2.6. Results are given for antenna arrays of different sizes and for scenarios with beamforming in both azimuth and elevation.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2753459","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08039290.pdf","startPage":"19711","endPage":"19719","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2753459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Averaged Realistic Maximum Power Levels for the Assessment of Radio Frequency Exposure for 5G Radio Base Stations Using Massive MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039290/","displayDocTitle":"Time-Averaged Realistic Maximum Power Levels for the Assessment of Radio Frequency Exposure for 5G Radio Base Stations Using Massive MIMO","volume":"5","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17266512","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8039290/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Time-Averaged Realistic Maximum Power Levels for the Assessment of Radio Frequency Exposure for 5G Radio Base Stations Using Massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"access-thors-2753459-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063979S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8039290","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8039298,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["Wuhan University, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xin Li is a PhD student in the School of Electronic Information at Wuhan University, China, and is currently a visiting PhD student at Washington University.

The control scheme can greatly reduce control cost and save both communication channels and bandwidth. By using multiple Lyapunov functions and convex combination techniques, sufficient conditions formulated by a set of linear matrix inequalities are derived to guarantee that all the node systems are synchronized with an isolated trajectory in a finite settling time. Compared with existing results, the main characteristics of this paper are twofold: 1) quantized controller is used for finite-time synchronization and 2) the designed multiple Lyapunov functions are strictly decreasing. An optimal algorithm is proposed for the estimation of settling time.

At last, two examples are used to test the validity of our results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8466053/08039418.pdf","startPage":"2774","endPage":"2782","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2017.2749511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2017.2749511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8466053","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Time Adaptive Control for a Class of Nonlinear Systems With Nonstrict Feedback Structure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Nonlinear systems","Stability criteria","Control systems","Backstepping","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","feedback","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","stability","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonstrict feedback structure","finite-time adaptive neural tracking control","nonlinear systems","nonstrict feedback form","semiglobal finite-time practical stability criterion","finite-time adaptive neural control strategy","tracking error","closed-loop signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive neural control","backstepping","finite time tracking","nonlinear systems","nonstrict feedback structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039418/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Time Adaptive Control for a Class of Nonlinear Systems With Nonstrict Feedback Structure","volume":"48","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8039418/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18079750","pubMedId":"28922138","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473160 and 61673227"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Time Adaptive Control for a Class of Nonlinear Systems With Nonstrict Feedback Structure","sourcePdf":"tcyb-chen-2749511-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141882S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8466053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8466053","articleId":"8039418","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8039429,"authors":[{"name":"Warren Weisler","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/8490137/8039429/weisl-2742798-small.gif","p":["Warren Weisler received the B.M. degree in voice performance from the\n University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA, in 2009, and the B.S. degree in mechanical\n engineering in 2014 from North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA, where he is currently working toward the\n Ph.D. degree.","In 2014, he worked as a Support Equipment intern with the Naval Air Systems Command at Cherry Point, NC, USA.

Moreover, a complex backpropagation algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent is derived for CV-CNN training. The proposed CV-CNN is then tested on the typical polarimetric SAR image classification task which classifies each pixel into known terrain types via supervised training. Experiments with the benchmark data sets of Flevoland and Oberpfaffenhofen show that the classification error can be further reduced if employing CV-CNN instead of conventional real-valued CNN with the same degrees of freedom. The performance of CV-CNN is comparable to that of existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall classification accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2017.2743222","publicationTitle":"IEEE

However, different ambient temperatures result in various current-voltage characteristics, meaning that the i.i.d. assumption is violated. To improve the estimation accuracy, a field-support vector regression soft sensor is proposed to estimate the irradiance levels from photovoltaic (PV) electrical characteristics. The soft sensing system groups its input data into several fields in accordance with ambient temperatures. By transforming the original data into a style-free and i.i.d. space, the soft sensing model achieves better estimation performance. The proposed soft sensor can be easily implemented through a PV module, a thermometer, a current sensor, and a DSP development board. It is validated by simulations and experimental prototyping using real outdoor measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2746091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8119588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2746091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8119588/08039432.pdf","startPage":"3183","endPage":"3191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Field-Support Vector Regression-Based Soft Sensor for Accurate Estimation of Solar Irradiance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Novel Field-Support Vector Regression-Based Soft Sensor for Accurate Estimation of Solar Irradiance","volume":"64","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8039432/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17390373","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039432/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61702353"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20160355"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005316","fundingName":"Science and Technology Project of Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development","grantNumber":"2016-K1-019"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Key Laboratory in Science and Technology Development Project of Suzhou","grantNumber":"SZS201609"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Field-Support Vector Regression-Based Soft Sensor for Accurate Estimation of Solar Irradiance","sourcePdf":"tcsi-huang-2746091-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077666S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8119588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8119588","articleId":"8039432","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8039433,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Liu","affiliation":["Wolfson School of Mechanical, Manufacturing and Electrical Engineering, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, U.K.","Centre de Villarceaux, Nokia Bell Labs, Nozay, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/8214923/8039433/liu-2748567-small.gif","p":["Ye Liu (M\u201915) received the B.Eng. degree (Hons.) in electronic and communication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2009 and 2014, respectively.

PNoCs typically employ photonic waveguides with dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) for signal traversal and microring resonators (MRs) for signal modulation. Unfortunately, DWDM increases susceptibility to intermodulation (IM) and off-resonance filtering effects, which reduce optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) for photonic data transfers. Additionally, process variations (PVs) induce variations in the width and thickness of MRs causing resonance wavelength shifts, which further reduce OSNR, and create communication errors. This paper proposes a novel cross-layer framework called HYDRA to mitigate heterodyne crosstalk due to PVs, off-resonance filtering, and IM effects in PNoCs. The framework consists of two device-level mechanisms and a circuit-level mechanism to improve heterodyne crosstalk resilience in PNoCs. Simulation results on three PNoC architectures indicate that HYDRA can improve the worst case OSNR by up to 5.3\u00d7 and significantly enhance the reliability of DWDM-based PNoC architectures.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/92/8240812/8039439-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039439/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","volume":"26","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17468581","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8039439/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"HYDRA: Heterodyne Crosstalk Mitigation With Double Microring Resonators and Data Encoding for Photonic NoCs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"SRC"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000083","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1252500 and CCF-1302693"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"AFOSR","grantNumber":"FA9550-13-1-0110"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"HYDRA: Heterodyne Crosstalk Mitigation With Double Microring Resonators and Data Encoding for Photonic NoCs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-chittamuru-2749967-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097553S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8240812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8240812","articleId":"8039439","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8039475,"authors":[{"name":"Zijian Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Zijian","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-1386-3695","id":"37085709035"},{"name":"Luc Vandendorpe","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Vandendorpe","id":"37269898400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8039475","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":479},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039475","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Signal to noise ratio","MISO","Complexity theory","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","mathematical analysis","MIMO communication","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient MISO systems","system signal-to-noise ratio","transmit antenna selection","single-output systems","energy-efficiency function","mathematical property"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transmit antenna selection","maximum ratio transmission","energy efficiency"]}],"abstract":"This letter studies the mathematical property of the energy-efficiency (EE) function for multiple-input single-output systems with transmit antenna selection.

The effectiveness of the proposed analytical framework is confirmed by simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17414960","htmlLink":"/document/8039476/","displayDocTitle":"Sum Rate Analysis for Multi-Cell Random Beamforming With Heterogeneous Schedule Probabilities","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB0501004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91638202, 91338115, 61231008, 61401326 and 61571351"},{"fundingName":"National S&T Major Project","grantNumber":"2015ZX03002006"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"WRYB142208 and JB140117"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B08038"},{"fundingName":"SAST","grantNumber":"201454"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China","grantNumber":"2016JQ6054"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum Rate Analysis for Multi-Cell Random Beamforming With Heterogeneous Schedule Probabilities","sourcePdf":"lcomm-li-2753780-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055829S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8170462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8170462","articleId":"8039476","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8039477,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086134660"},{"name":"Sourabh Khandelwal","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Sourabh","lastName":"Khandelwal","id":"37400879400"},{"name":"Asif Islam Khan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Asif Islam","lastName":"Khan","orcid":"0000-0003-4369-106X","id":"37291162400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"8039477","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1668},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscillators","Hysteresis","MOSFET","Logic gates","Integrated circuit modeling","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ferroelectric devices","field effect transistors","nonlinear network synthesis","relaxation oscillators","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ferroelectric oscillators","coupled networks","ferroelectric field-effect transistor","FEFET","relaxation oscillators","hysteresis loop","dynamical systems","efficient physical platforms","nonlinear oscillator","dynamic voltage control","ferroelectric basedcomplex"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ferroelectric FET","coupled system","neuromorphic"]}],"abstract":"We propose ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FEFET)-based realization of non-linear, relaxation oscillators and their coupled networks.

The in-water light propagation model was proposed several years ago but is relatively complicated to be used in reality. In this paper, the full underwater light propagation model is simplified to be used as the transmission model. On the basis of this model, we propose a new method, called maximum attenuation identification, to derive the depth map from degraded underwater images. At the same time, regional background estimation is implemented to ensure optimal performance. Experiments on three groups of images, namely, natural underwater scene, calibration board, and colormap board, are conducted. We report the quantitative and qualitative comparisons of our approach with existing state-of-the-art approaches. The performance evaluation on contrast enhancement and color restoration validates that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039483/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","volume":"5","accessionNumber":"17266514","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/8039483/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Underwater Image Restoration via Maximum Attenuation Identification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61703381"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007129","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"ZR2017BF006"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016M590658"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"201713017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Underwater Image Restoration via Maximum Attenuation Identification","sourcePdf":"access-zheng-2753796-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106122S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8039483","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8039487,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyue Zhou","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8064976/8039487/zhou-2754102-small.gif","p":["Hongyue Zhou received the B.S. degree in theoretical and applied mechanics from Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China, in 2010, and the M.S. degree in engineering mechanics from Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China, in 2013.

In the past, many works were devoted to the modeling of TED under the effect of non-Fourier heat conduction. Some analytical and numerical results for TED were presented. However, the spectrum of TED contains multiple peaks only in the numerical results. The previous analytical model failed to give a reasonable prediction for the multiple-peak phenomenon. Few works can give a convincing explanation for the existence of multiple peaks. In this paper, the TED in micro- and nanobeam resonators under the effect of non-Fourier heat conduction is investigated using the generalized thermoelasticity theory with single-phase-lag time. An analytical formula of TED is obtained in the form of infinite series. The effects of non-Fourier heat conduction on TED are studied for representative cases of the micro- and nanobeams. A simple analytical expression for the accurate determination of the multiple peaks in TED is obtained. The results of the present model agree well with the numerical results available in the reported literature. The results of this paper may bring new insights for the multiple-peak phenomenon of TED spectrum in micro- and nanobeams.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2017.2754102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2017.2754102","startPage":"6966","endPage":"6977","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/8064976/08039487.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8064976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermoelastic Damping in Micro- and Nanobeam Resonators With Non-Fourier Heat Conduction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1, 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Thermoelastic Damping in Micro- and Nanobeam Resonators With Non-Fourier Heat Conduction","publicationDate":"1 Nov.1, 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2017","volume":"17","issue":"21","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8039487/","accessionNumber":"17241355","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039487/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51375091"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermoelastic Damping in Micro- and Nanobeam Resonators With Non-Fourier Heat Conduction","sourcePdf":"jsen-li-2754102-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08394S","chronDate":"Nov.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8064976","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8064976","articleId":"8039487","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8039488,"authors":[{"name":"Guozhi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Engineering, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, China","Beijing Key Laboratory of Security and Privacy in Intelligent Transportation, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8039488/zhang-2754058-small.gif","p":["Guozhi Zhang received the B.S. and M.A.Sc. degrees from Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, China, in 1999 and 2006, respectively.

One critical issue in CCN is in-network cache allocation. It is known that in-network caching mechanisms are vulnerable to distributed denial of service attacks, especially to pollution attacks. That is, a caching mechanism under pollution attacks cannot work well. The past years witnessed kinds of proposals of cache allocation mechanisms. However, none of them could effectively allocate in-network cache while defending against attacks. In this paper, we propose a lightweight non-collaborative cache allocation approach (IFDD), which could not only enhance in-network caching performance in terms of the cache hit ratio and the request processing delay, but also defend against pollution attacks. By lightweight, we mean that IFDD generates low communication overhead (due to non-collaboration) and computational overhead at routers. The key idea behind IFDD is to combine the content popularity with the content locality in making caching decision.

The first one is how to locate the area that better indicates what the subjects in the videos are doing. The second one is how we can utilize the appearance and motion information from the video data. In this paper, we propose a gaze-assisted deep neural network, which performs the action recognition task with the help of human visual attention. Based on the above-mentioned consideration, we first collect a large number of human gaze data by recording the eye movements of human subjects when they watch the video. Then, we employ a fully convolutional network to learn to predict the human gaze. To efficiently utilize the human gaze, inspired by the rank pooling concept, which can encode the video into one image, we design a novel video representation named by dynamic gaze. The proposed dynamic gaze captures both the appearance and motion information from the video, and our human gaze data can better locate the area of interest. Based on the dynamic gaze, we build our dynamic gaze stream. We combine the proposed dynamic gaze stream together with the two-stream architecture as our final multi-stream architecture. We have collected over 300-k human gaze maps for the J-HMDB data set in this paper, and experiments show that the proposed multi-stream architecture can achieve comparable results with the state of the art in the task of action recognition with both collected human gaze data and predicted human gaze data.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

Digital acquisition of the in-phase and quadrature (I and Q) components of each subband is important for the extraction of radar targets. However, the existing acquisition methods are inefficient because their sampling rates are at least twice of the effective bandwidth, also known as the Landau rate. In this paper, we merge the quadrature compressive sampling into the uniform sampling technique for multiband signals, and develop a multiband quadrature compressive sampling (MQuadCS) system. The MQuadCS system first applies the random modulation to generate a compressive multiband signal, and then utilizes the uniform sampling to output the samples of the compressive multiband signal at its Landau rate. As the Landau rate of the compressive multiband signal is much less than that of the received echo, the MQuadCS achieves the sub-Landau rate sampling. With the assumption of sparse targets, the I and Q components of each subband can be independently recovered by the corresponding samples separated from the compressive multiband samples. For the independent recovery, we establish the model of MQuadCS system parameters and provide a sufficient condition to ensure the existence of the system parameters. To guarantee successful recovery of each subband, we introduce the frequency domain representation of the MQuadCS and then derive the reconstructability condition via restricted isometry property analysis. Furthermore, we design a system parameter optimization scheme to improve the recovery performance. Theoretical analyses and simulations validate the efficiency of the MQuadCS system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","Bandwidth","Sufficient conditions","Dictionaries","Optimization","Demodulation","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","radar signal processing","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiband radar echo signals","received echo","multiband signals","subband","sampling rates","uniform sampling technique","multiband quadrature compressive sampling system","compressive multiband signal","sub-Landau rate sampling","compressive multiband samples","MQuadCS system parameters","multiband-multifunction radars"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiband signal","compressed sampling","quadrature sampling","analog-to-information conversion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2753826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08039495.pdf","startPage":"19742","endPage":"19760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2753826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadrature Compressive Sampling for Multiband Radar Echo Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quadrature Compressive Sampling for Multiband Radar Echo Signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039495/","volume":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/8039495/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17266518","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401210, 61571228 and 61671245"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Quadrature Compressive Sampling for Multiband Radar Echo Signals","sourcePdf":"access-chen-2753826-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106201S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8039495","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8039498,"authors":[{"name":"Arti M.K.","affiliation":["YMCA University of Science and Technology, Faridabad, Haryana, IN"],"firstName":"Arti","lastName":"M.K.","id":"37085439634"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8039498","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":421},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Decoding","Slot antennas","Spatial diversity","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","error statistics","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","space-time block codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time transmission scheme","MIMO system","STTS","multiple-input multiple-output communication systems","channel coherence time","transmit antennas","spatial diversity order","spacetime block codes","moment generating function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Space-time transmission scheme","large MIMO systems","performance analysis","M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK)","Rayleigh fading","symbol error rate"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose a space-time transmission scheme (STTS) for large multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. These systems are primarily used to transmit a huge amount of data. The existing spacetime block codes (STBCs) are not suitable for these systems due to the fact that these STBCs require very large channel coherence time (more than the number of transmit antennas), render poor data rate (less than one), and aim at full spatial diversity. In a practical large MIMO system with one thousand transmit and one thousand receive antennas, the diversity order of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sup>\n can be achieved; however, such a high value of diversity order is not required in practical systems. Therefore, an STTS with good data rate, parsimoniously utilized temporal dimensions, and symbol-wise decoding is essentially required for practical large MIMO systems. In this letter, we emphasize design of a new STTS by relaxing the constraint of achieving full spatial diversity. In the proposed STTS, the data rate of the large MIMO system is increased at the expense of the reduction in spatial diversity order. An approximate expression of symbol error rate of the proposed system is obtained-based on the moment generating function of the instantaneous received signal-to-noise ratio. Further, it is shown that the diversity order of the proposed STTS-based system is one less than the number of receive antennas.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2017.2753800","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/8293945/08039498.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"65","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2017.2753800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8293945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Space-Time Transmission Scheme for Large MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039498/","displayDocTitle":"A Space-Time Transmission Scheme for Large MIMO Systems","volume":"7","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17595955","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8039498/","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Space-Time Transmission Scheme for Large MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"lwc-mk-2753800-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079149S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8293945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8293945","articleId":"8039498","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8039499,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqing Wei","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8039499/wei-2753781-small.gif","p":["Zhiqing Wei (M\u201915) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2010 and 2015, respectively.

However, the existing studies on LF mostly focus on the fingerprint of Wi-Fi below 6 GHz, bluetooth, ultra wideband, and so on. The LF with millimeter-wave (mmWave) was rarely addressed. Since mmWave has the characteristics of narrow beam, fast signal attenuation, and wide bandwidth, and so on, the positioning error can be reduced. In this paper, an LF positioning method with mmWave is proposed, which is named direction of arrival (DoA)-LF. Besides received signal strength indicator of access points (APs), the fingerprint database contains DoA information of APs, which is obtained via DoA estimation. Then the impact of the number of APs, the interval of reference points, the channel model of mmWave and the error of DoA estimation algorithm on positioning error is analyzed with Cramer-Rao lower bound. Finally, the proposed DoA-LF algorithm with mmWave is verified through simulations. The simulation results have proved that mmWave can reduce the positioning error due to the fact that mmWave has larger path loss exponent and smaller variance of shadow fading compared with low frequency signals. Besides, accurate DoA estimation can reduce the positioning error.Kay, Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing: Estimation

The framework, based on a biologically grounded theory of the brain and mind, integrates a reactive interaction engine, a number of state-of-the-art perceptual and motor learning algorithms, as well as planning abilities and an autobiographical memory. The architecture as a whole drives the robot behavior to solve the symbol grounding problem, acquire language capabilities, execute goal-oriented behavior, and express a verbal narrative of its own experience in the world.

In this paper, a full probabilistic formulation of the EMIS is presented for the first time, which is then solved by applying the well-known expectation maximization method.

Thus, this VN's local girths, after more than one edge is added to the current tanner graph (TG) setting, may not be maximized relative to that TG setting. To address this problem, we define the multi-edge local girth and edge-trial, and based on these definitions, propose a new multi-edge metric-constrained PEG algorithm (MM-PEGA) to improve the design at each VN. The MM-PEGA constructs an edge in each stage that, relative to the current TG setting, can potentially maximize the VN of interest's local girth after a certain number (up to the edge-trial) of edges are added to the TG setting. We first analyze the properties of the multi-edge local girth, and then propose an algorithm for calculating the multi-edge local girth. We also propose a method for accelerating the MM-PEGA. Moreover, we generalize the MM-PEGA for improving different PEG-like designs. According to the theoretical analysis, increasing the edge-trial of the MM-PEGA is expected to positively affect the cycle-structure and the error performance of resulting low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. This expectation is verified by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2753805","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8258580/08039508.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8258580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2753805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Multi-Edge Metric-Constrained PEG Algorithm for Designing Binary LDPC Code With Improved Cycle-Structure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"A New Multi-Edge Metric-Constrained PEG Algorithm for Designing Binary LDPC Code With Improved Cycle-Structure","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039508/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17519954","htmlLink":"/document/8039508/","volume":"66","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Multi-Edge Metric-Constrained PEG Algorithm for Designing Binary LDPC Code With Improved Cycle-Structure","sourcePdf":"tcomm-he-2753805-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120018S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8258580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8258580","articleId":"8039508","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8039509,"authors":[{"name":"Weicong Kong","affiliation":["School of EE&T, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Weicong Kong (S\u201914) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively, the M.Sc. degree from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, U.K., in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Sydney, Australia, in 2017.

Other than aggregated residential load in a large scale, forecasting an electric load of a single energy user is fairly challenging due to the high volatility and uncertainty involved. In this paper, we propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network-based framework, which is the latest and one of the most popular techniques of deep learning, to tackle this tricky issue. The proposed framework is tested on a publicly available set of real residential smart meter data, of which the performance is comprehensively compared to various benchmarks including the state-of-the-arts in the field of load forecasting. As a result, the proposed LSTM approach outperforms the other listed rival algorithms in the task of short-term load forecasting for individual residential households.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2017.2753802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8595470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2017.2753802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8595470/08039509.pdf","startPage":"841","endPage":"851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Term Residential Load Forecasting Based on LSTM Recurrent Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Short-Term Residential Load Forecasting Based on LSTM Recurrent Neural Network","volume":"10","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8039509/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18339661","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039509/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term Residential Load Forecasting Based on LSTM Recurrent Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tsg-dong-2753802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100166S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8595470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"228","xplore-issue":"8595470","articleId":"8039509","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8039510,"authors":[{"name":"Marcelo Zanetti","affiliation":["Pontifical Catholic University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Marcelo","lastName":"Zanetti","id":"37086569176"},{"name":"Edgard Jamhour","affiliation":["Pontifical Catholic University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Edgard","lastName":"Jamhour","orcid":"0000-0001-6049-4573","id":"37267832000"},{"name":"Marcelo Pellenz","affiliation":["Pontifical Catholic University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Marcelo","lastName":"Pellenz","id":"37284163300"},{"name":"Manoel Penna","affiliation":["Pontifical Catholic University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Manoel","lastName":"Penna","id":"37548552500"},{"name":"Voldi Zambenedetti","affiliation":["Pontifical Catholic University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Voldi","lastName":"Zambenedetti","id":"37071765000"},{"name":"Ivan Chueiri","affiliation":["Pontifical Catholic University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Chueiri","id":"37086565616"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-3053"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-3061"}],"articleNumber":"8039510","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1091},"abstract":"We propose a fraud detection systems (FDS) for advanced metering infrastructure based on anomaly detection on the energy consumption reports from smart meters. Fraud inspection is triggered when a discrepancy between the energy supplied by the grid and that reported by smart meters is detected. We use an innovative approach, where consumption reports registered shortly before and after the discrepancy detection are compared to detect a fraud. Our FDS introduces an important innovation by showing that it is possible to use only a small set of recent measures to define a consumption pattern. We call these patterns short-lived because they are expected to represent the behavior of a consumer for a short period, only enough to detect an ongoing fraud. This approach allows the FDS to account for natural changes in the consumption behavior of users and also helps to preserve their privacy. The FDS can be tuned, using an optimization procedure, by imposing constraints on the true or false alarm rates, or maximizing an objective function that represents the revenue of the utility.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart meters","Meters","Support vector machines","Clustering algorithms","Voltage measurement","Monitoring","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","fraud","power engineering computing","power system security","security of data","smart meters","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tunable fraud detection system","advanced metering infrastructure","fraud detection systems","FDS","anomaly detection","energy consumption reports","smart meters","fraud inspection","discrepancy detection","consumption pattern","consumption behavior"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AMI","fraud detection","smart meter","energy theft","clustering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSG.2017.2753738","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8595470/08039510.pdf","startPage":"830","endPage":"840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8595470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2017.2753738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Tunable Fraud Detection System for Advanced Metering Infrastructure Using Short-Lived Patterns","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Tunable Fraud Detection System for Advanced Metering Infrastructure Using Short-Lived Patterns","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039510/","volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8039510/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18339655","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Tunable Fraud Detection System for Advanced Metering Infrastructure Using Short-Lived Patterns","sourcePdf":"tsg-jamhour-2753738-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09819S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8595470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8595470","articleId":"8039510","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":8039518,"authors":[{"name":"Shahin Shahrampour","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Shahin","lastName":"Shahrampour","orcid":"0000-0003-3093-8510","id":"37072932900"},{"name":"Mohammad Noshad","affiliation":["VLNComm, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Noshad","id":"38264083800"},{"name":"Jie Ding","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Ding","id":"37085673343"},{"name":"Vahid Tarokh","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Tarokh","orcid":"0000-0003-2994-6302","id":"37271249900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8039518","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":660},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039518","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data integration","Object recognition","Tactile sensors","Grasping","Multisensory integration","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image fusion","learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition","probability","support vector machines","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online learning","object recognition","online multimodal data fusion","multiple modes","7-D time series","streaming vector time series","unknown object","dictionary object","pressure data","dissimilarity metric","probability distribution","standard offline classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Online learning","mirror descent","tactile sensing","object recognition"]}],"abstract":"We consider online multimodal data fusion, where the goal is to combine information from multiple modes to identify an element in a large dictionary. We address this problem in the context of object recognition by focusing on tactile sensing as one of the modes. Using a tactile glove with seven sensors, various individuals grasp different objects to obtain 7-D time series, where each component represents the pressure sequence applied to one sensor. The pressure data of all objects is stored in a dictionary as a reference. The objective is to match a streaming vector time series from grasping an unknown object to a dictionary object. We propose an algorithm that may start with prior knowledge provided by other modes. Receiving pressure data sequentially, the algorithm uses a dissimilarity metric to modify the prior and form a probability distribution over the dictionary. When the dictionary objects are dissimilar in shape, we empirically show that our algorithm recognize the unknown object even with a uniform prior. If there exists a similar object to the unknown object in the dictionary, our algorithm needs the prior from other modes to detect the unknown object. Notably, our algorithm maintains a similar performance to standard offline classification techniques, such as support vector machine, with a significantly lower computational time.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2017.2754141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2017.2754141","startPage":"1259","endPage":"1263","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8447179/08039518.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8447179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Learning for Multimodal Data Fusion With Application to Object Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039518/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Online Learning for Multimodal Data Fusion With Application to Object Recognition","volume":"65","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2018","accessionNumber":"18042747","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8039518/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","grantNumber":"N66001-15-C-4028 and W911NF-14-1-0508"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Learning for Multimodal Data Fusion With Application to Object Recognition","sourcePdf":"tcsii-shahrampour-2754141-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071166S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8447179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8447179","articleId":"8039518","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8039520,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Hence, this paper focuses on the impact of these residual imperfections on the ergodic channel capacity for optimal receivers, and on the ergodic sum rates for linear minimum mean-squared-error (MMSE) receivers. Moreover, the low- and high-signal-to-noise ratio cornerstones are characterized for both types of receivers. Simple closed-form expressions are obtained that allow the extraction of interesting conclusions. For example, the minimum transmit energy per information bit for optimal and MMSE receivers is not subject to any additive impairments. In addition to the exact analysis, we also study the Rayleigh-product channels in the large system regime, and we elaborate on the behavior of the ergodic channel capacity with optimal receivers by varying the severity of the transceiver additive impairments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039521/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","volume":"66","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17519923","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8039521/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Residual Additive Transceiver Hardware Impairments on Rayleigh-Product MIMO Channels With Linear Receivers: Exact and Asymptotic Analyses","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)","grantNumber":"EP/L025299/1"},{"fundingName":"projects H2020 SANSA and FNR SATSENT, ECLECTIC, INWIPNET, PROSAT"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Residual Additive Transceiver Hardware Impairments on Rayleigh-Product MIMO Channels With Linear Receivers: Exact and Asymptotic Analyses","sourcePdf":"tcomm-papazafeiropoulos-2753773-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104737S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8258580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8258580","articleId":"8039521","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8039522,"authors":[{"name":"Shirantha Welikala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Peradeniya, Kanky, Sri Lanka"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8595470/8039522/welik-2743760-small.gif","p":["Shirantha Welikala (S\u201913) received the B.Sc.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, in 2015, where he joined the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering as a Temporary Instructor and is currently a Research Assistant.

In the first stage, the AUPs of a given residence were learned using a spectral decomposition based standard NILM algorithm. Then, learnt AUPs were utilized to bias the priori probabilities of the appliances through a specifically constructed fuzzy system. The AUPs contain likelihood measures for each appliance to be active at the present instant based on the recent activity/inactivity of appliances and the time of day. Hence, the priori probabilities determined through the AUPs increase the active load identification accuracy of the NILM algorithm. The proposed method was successfully tested for two standard databases containing real household measurements in USA and Germany. The proposed method demonstrates an improvement in active load estimation when applied to the aforementioned databases as the proposed method augments the smart meter readings with the behavioral trends obtained from AUPs. Furthermore, a residential power consumption forecasting mechanism, which can predict the total active power demand of an aggregated set of houses, 5 min ahead of real time, was successfully formulated and implemented utilizing the proposed AUP based technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039522/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","volume":"10","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"18365312","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8039522/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Incorporating Appliance Usage Patterns for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring and Load Forecasting","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation Sri Lanka","grantNumber":"RG/2016/EA and ICT/01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Incorporating Appliance Usage Patterns for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring and Load Forecasting","sourcePdf":"tsg-ekanayake-2743760-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129108S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8595470","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8595470","articleId":"8039522","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8039523,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Wang","affiliation":["Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/9286945/8039523/wang-2753775-small.gif","p":["Nan Wang received the undergraduate degree from Beijing Jiaotong University, China, the MSc degree in management and information technology from the University of St Andrews, in 2014, and the MRes degree in web science and big data analytics from the University College London, in 2015.

This raises the need for fog computing, which leverages computing at the edge of the network on nodes, such as routers, base stations and switches, along with the cloud. However, to realise fog computing the challenge of managing edge nodes will need to be addressed. This paper is motivated to address the resource management challenge. We develop the first framework to manage edge nodes, namely the Edge NOde Resource Management (ENORM) framework. Mechanisms for provisioning and auto-scaling edge node resources are proposed. The feasibility of the framework is demonstrated on a Pok\u00e9Mon Go-like online game use-case. The benefits of using ENORM are observed by reduced application latency between 20-80 percent and reduced data transfer and communication frequency between the edge node and the cloud by up to 95 percent. These results highlight the potential of fog computing for improving the quality of service and experience.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2017.2753775","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/9286945/08039523.pdf","startPage":"1086","endPage":"1099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9286945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2017.2753775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ENORM: A Framework For <b>E</b>dge <b>NO</b>de <b>R</b>esource <b>M</b>anagement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1 2020","displayDocTitle":"ENORM: A Framework For <b>E</b>dge <b>NO</b>de <b>R</b>esource <b>M</b>anagement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8039523/","publicationDate":"1 Nov.-Dec. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"20259235","htmlLink":"/document/8039523/","volume":"13","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland","grantNumber":"14/IA/2474"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008303","fundingName":"Department for Employment and Learning, Northern Ireland","grantNumber":"14/IA/2474"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ENORM: A Framework For <bold>E</bold>dge <bold>NO</bold>de <bold>R</bold>esource <bold>M</bold>anagement","sourcePdf":"tsc-wang-2753775-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177033S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"9286945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"9286945","articleId":"8039523","onlineDate":"18 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8039527,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Garrido","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Garrido","orcid":"0000-0001-5739-3544","id":"37424933800"},{"name":"Nanda K.

The proposed TSHI consists of a zero-crossing-detector (ZCD)-based integrator and an inverter-based integrator. In the coarse-integration step, the ZCD-based integrator performs a fast integration without concern for overshoot or detection delay issues. In the fine-integration step, the inverter-based integrator performs the residual integration with high accuracy. Hence, the TSHI provides fast and accurate integration process. In addition, the TSHI supports trade-off between voltage-scalable bandwidth and power consumption for an energy efficient operation of Internet-of-Things sensor nodes, owing to the scalable operation of the ZCD and inverter.

In this channel model, there are two groups of source nodes, each group contains two source nodes, every source node in one group exchanges independent messages with every source node in another group via a common relay node, and each node has a different number of antennas. First, we derive an outer bound of the DoF region by using the cut-set theorem and the genie-message approach. Then, we obtain an inner bound of the DoF region by proposing a new transmission scheme that collectively utilizes antenna deactivation, pairwise signal alignment, cyclic signal alignment, and generalized signal alignment techniques. In the case of symmetric data exchange, our inner bound coincides with the outer bound, and thus, our proposed transmission strategy is optimal. We also obtain the optimal sum DoF for the special case, where the source nodes within a same group are equipped with the same number of antennas.
