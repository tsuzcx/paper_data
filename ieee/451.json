The controller is located according to mode controllability index, and the input signals of controller are selected according to mode observability index. Then a method is presented to obtain the optimal global signals combination under the constraints of the amount of signals. The parameters tuning of the controller is based on phase compensation information. The proposed schemes are validated by eigenvalue analysis of a two-area system.

Real time simulation and closed-loop testing is essential to the development of these controllers. This paper introduces the methods used to create large scale power system models on the RTDS Simulator for the testing of PMU's. Data conversion and load flow programs are two tools that are very effective when creating large scale electromagnetic transient simulations. The paper explains the key aspects of these tools. For some applications, high precision pulses are used by PMU's to measure generator rotor angles. A pulse must be given for each revolution of the generator with an accuracy of 3-5 microseconds. This is a challenge for a discrete time simulation operating with a typical timestep of 50-70 microseconds. A technique to provide the pulse with an accuracy of 1 microsecond is introduced. Finally an example is presented to demonstrate the entire process of creating large scale power system models on the RTDS Simulator for PMU testing.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509990","publicationTitle":"2007 International Power Engineering Conference (IPEC 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Power Engineering Conference (IPEC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4494446/4509990/04510060.pdf","startPage":"383","endPage":"388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large scale power system simulation and PMU testing using a real time digital simulator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Large scale power system simulation and PMU testing using a real time digital simulator","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4510060/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"10028094","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510060/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large scale power system simulation and PMU testing using a real time digital simulator","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-04252008-00070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081793S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4494446","isNumber":"4509990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4494446","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4509990","articleId":"4510060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Nanyang Technological UniversityRPS","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4510109,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) inverter is one of the most used multilevel topologies for wind turbine (WT) and photovoltaic (PV) applications. One of the most crucial points in this type of converter is dc-voltage control. In this paper, a novel multi output dc-dc converter connected to a diode clamped topology is presented. This converter, for a given duty cycles, is able to regulate the capacitor voltage to provide an appropriate input voltage for NPC regardless of load changes which can avoid neutral point balancing problem in such converters. In addition, the presented topology is suitable for renewable energy systems to boost the low rectified output-voltage. In order to verify the proposed topology, steady state analysis, modelling and simulations are carried out.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diodes","Circuit topology","Renewable energy resources","Voltage","Power electronics","Inverters","Wind turbines","Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation","DC-DC power converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","diodes","renewable energy sources","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diode clamped topology","multilevel converters","neutral point clamped inverter","wind turbine","photovoltaic applications","dc-voltage control","multioutput dc-dc converter","capacitor voltage","neutral point balancing problem","renewable energy systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multilevel inverter","diode clamped inverter","neutral point voltage","dc-dc converter","multi-output converter"]}],"publicationTitle":"2007 International Power Engineering Conference (IPEC 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Power Engineering Conference (IPEC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4494446/4509990/04510109.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new configuration for multilevel converters with diode clamped topology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new configuration for multilevel converters with diode clamped topology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510109/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510109/","accessionNumber":"10028142","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new configuration for multilevel converters with diode clamped topology","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-04252008-00119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049632S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4494446","isNumber":"4509990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4494446","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4509990","articleId":"4510109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Nanyang Technological UniversityRPS","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4510150,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It follows two steps, damping assessment and parameter optimization. Prony analysis based on single machine equivalent (SIME) is used for identifying the critical mode and corresponding damping ratio. The damping ratio is an important index for control effect in both small and large signal analysis. If the system is poorly damped after a large disturbance, genetic algorithm (GA) combing with damping assessment procedure as part of the individual evaluation is applied for retuning the control parameters. Test results show that damping assessment extract key information from multi-machine swing curve correctly; the optimized control provides good damping to power system oscillations induced by severe disturbance and makes the system meet preassigned damping performance criterion in large-signal analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4510150/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"10028183","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Retuning control parameters based on damping assessment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retuning control parameters based on damping assessment","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-04252008-00160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055939S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4494446","isNumber":"4509990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4494446","xplore-issue":"4509990","articleId":"4510150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Nanyang Technological UniversityRPS","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4510155,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Zhi-Qiang","affiliation":["Pumped Storage Power Station of China Southern Power Grid China, China"],"bio":{"p":["Wang Zhi-Qiang was born in China in 1969, he received the B.S. degree form Three Gorges University.

Using the proposed method, high accuracy of fault classification is achieved. Fundamental component of pre-fault and post-fault positive sequence component of currents and voltages of three phases have been used as inputs to proposed ANN. The output of the ANN is the estimated fault location. A two machine power system model is simulated by PSCAD/EMTDC to obtain the mentioned voltages and currents values.

For the global optimal convergence ability of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which has been developed and put into use in many nonlinear optimization solutions, the above problems can be solved effectively. In this paper, the fault location equations including the unknown variables (line parameters, asynchronous sampling angle and fault position), are constructed and transformed into the nonlinear optimization problem. Then, the PSO based solution model for the problem is set up. However, only using PSO, the tests of the fault location find that the particles are inactive during the middle and last searching process and the deep-searching ability is not strong enough. So, after analyzing the characteristic of least squares method (LSM) , this paper proposes a novel fault location scheme, which combines the global optimal convergence ability of PSO and the fast and accurate convergence ability of LSM. The simulation results proved that the proposed scheme has higher precision and stability.","startPage":"1151","endPage":"1155","publicationTitle":"2007 International Power Engineering Conference (IPEC 2007)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509990","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Power Engineering Conference (IPEC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4494446/4509990/04510199.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel fault location for transmission line by the combination of Particle Swarm Optimization and least squares method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510199/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel fault location for transmission line by the combination of Particle Swarm Optimization and least squares method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510199/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10028230","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel fault location for transmission line by the combination of Particle Swarm Optimization and least squares method","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-04252008-00209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062377S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4494446","isNumber":"4509990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4494446","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4509990","articleId":"4510199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"RPS","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4510235,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The method of economic dispatch for generating units at different loads must have total fuel cost at the minimum point. There are many conventional methods that can use to solve economic dispatch problem such as Lagrange multiplier method, Lamda iteration method and Newton- Raphson method. However, an obstacle in optimal economic dispatch of conventional methods is the changed load. They are necessary' to find the optimal economic dispatch from time to time. Moreover, they need a lot of time to repeat calculation for a new solution again. This paper presents back-propagation neural networks model to carry out instead the conventional Lamda iteration method. It is compared with the experimental results of electrical power system of 3 10 and 20 generating units respectively. The testing results of the back-propagation neural networks are compared with the Lamda iteration method by testing the teaching data and non-teaching data. It shows clearly that the back-propagation neural networks can find out the solutions accurately and use time to calculate less than other systems that are tested. Error of prediction will be increased slightly by the number of generating units in electrical power plants because it needs to learn a lot of input and output data in the neural network dramatically.","startPage":"1343","endPage":"1348","publicationTitle":"2007 International Power Engineering Conference (IPEC 2007)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509990","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Power Engineering Conference (IPEC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4494446/4509990/04510235.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal economic dispatch for power generation using artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510235/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal economic dispatch for power generation using artificial neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510235/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10028265","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal economic dispatch for power generation using artificial neural network","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-04252008-00245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09641S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4494446","isNumber":"4509990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4494446","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4509990","articleId":"4510235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Nanyang Technological University","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4510291,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Jhe Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shih-Jhe Lin","id":"37087521730"},{"name":"Yu-Jung Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Jung Huang","id":"37087159734"},{"name":"Ching-Mai Ko","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Mai Ko","id":"37087947079"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1909-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1910-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4510291","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulated annealing","Design methodology","Power system reliability","Cost function","Genetic algorithms","Routing","Design optimization","System performance","Wire","Minimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","genetic algorithms","multichip modules","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichip module placement model","multiobjective optimization problem","simulated annealing","genetic algorithm","multiobjective component placement","wire length minimization","bounding box approximation method","finite element analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-chip Module","Placement","Bounding Box","Multi-objective","Genetic Algorithm","Simulated Annealing","Finite Element"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510291","abstract":"Placement of multiple dies on an MCM substrate is a difficult combinatorial task in which multiple criteria need to be considered simultaneously to obtain a true multi-objective optimization. In this paper we described a MCM placement model for the multi-objective optimization problem and solved this model by the simulated annealing SA algorithm and the hybrid optimization strategy GASA (namely the combination of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing) respectively. Our design methodologies consider multi-objective component placement based on thermal reliability, routing length and chip area criteria for multi-chip module. The purpose of the multi-objective optimization placement is to enhance the system performance, reliability and reduce the substrate area by obtaining an optimal cost during multi-chip module placement design phase. For reliability considerations, the design methodology focuses on the placement of the power dissipating chips to achieve uniform thermal distribution. For route-ability consideration, the total wire length minimization is estimated by bounding box approximation method. For substrate area consideration, the area is estimated by minimum area contains all chips. The cost function is formulated by the weight sum calculation. For design flexibility, different weights can be assigned depending on designer\u2019s considerations. Various methods including simulated annealing and hybrid generic algorithm are applied to solve the placement solutions. 3-D Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is carried out to assess thermal distribution in MCM substrate. The optimization results of various weighting assignments obtained by different algorithms are compared. In addition, an auto generated optimal placement layout based on the analytical solution is also presented.","doi":"10.1109/EMAP.2007.4510291","pdfPath":"/iel5/4489832/4510273/04510291.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Electronic Materials and Packaging","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Electronic Materials and Packaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMAP.2007.4510291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MCM placement problem with GASA multi-objective optimization strategy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"MCM placement problem with GASA multi-objective optimization strategy","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9964319","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4510291/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MCM placement problem with GASA multi-objective optimization strategy","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SPI-04252008-00018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044886S","chronDate":"19-22 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4489832","isNumber":"4510273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4489832","xplore-issue":"4510273","articleId":"4510291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4510331,"authors":[{"name":"Jun So Pak","affiliation":["Terahertz Interconnection and Packaging Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,  Division of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jun So Pak","id":"37265543900"},{"name":"Chunghyun Ryu","affiliation":["Terahertz Interconnection and Packaging Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,  Division of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chunghyun Ryu","id":"37287960500"},{"name":"Joungho Kim","affiliation":["Terahertz Interconnection and Packaging Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,  Division of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Joungho Kim","id":"37281190400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1909-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1910-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4510331","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1490},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Through-silicon vias","Integrated circuit interconnections","Electronics packaging","Substrates","Electric variables","Semiconductor device packaging","Circuit simulation","Structural engineering","Power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","silicon","SPICE","system-in-package"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eectrical characterization","through silicon via","TSV","structural parameters","material parameters","3D full wave simulation","DC leakage blocking","SPICE circuit simulator","Si"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we show the electrical characteristics of TSV (through silicon via) depending on structural parameters such as TSV pitch, TSV height, TSV size and thickness of SiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n for DC leakage blocking between TSV and silicon substrate, and material parameter of silicon substrate such as silicon resistivity in case of single silicon substrate.

The architecture is based on sampling the signal directly at RF, which in the GNSS case is in the 1.5 GHz range. The high-frequencies in the signal to be sampled pose then very high demands for the accuracy and quality of the sampling process, and thus quantization and especially the timing jitter aspects must be considered in detail. Both system calculations as well as computer simulations are used to assess the essential requirements for the sampling process. In summary, the study shows that the quantization and jitter requirements are in principle feasible when the pre-sampling filtering is done properly.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Sampling methods","Satellite navigation systems","Signal sampling","Quantization","RF signals","Signal processing","Timing jitter","Computer simulation","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","quantisation (signal)","radio receivers","satellite navigation","signal sampling","timing jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct RF sampling receiver architecture","global navigation satellite system","GNSS environment","quantization","timing jitter","presampling filtering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direct RF Sampling","radio receiver design","satellite navigation systems","timing jitter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WPNC.2008.4510351","publicationTitle":"2008 5th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4494447/4510344/04510351.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPNC.2008.4510351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design considerations for direct RF sampling receiver in GNSS environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design considerations for direct RF sampling receiver in GNSS environment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510351/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510351/","accessionNumber":"10013446","conferenceDate":"27-27 March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-27 March 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design considerations for direct RF sampling receiver in GNSS environment","confLoc":"Hannover, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-04292008-00007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05133S","chronDate":"27-27 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4494447","isNumber":"4510344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4494447","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4510344","articleId":"4510351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4510357,"authors":[{"name":"Bernhard Krach","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center DLR, Institute of Communications and Navigation, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Krach","id":"37318544500"},{"name":"Patrick Robertson","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center DLR, Institute of Communications and Navigation, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Robertson","id":"37357211900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1798-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1799-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4510357","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":632},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510357","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Foot","State estimation","Accelerometers","Particle measurements","Particle filters","Change detection algorithms","Satellite navigation systems","Aerodynamics","Sensor systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","Kalman filters","navigation","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["foot-mounted inertial sensor","Bayesian location estimation framework","Kalman filter","nonlinear map matching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pedestrian Navigation","Inertial Integration","Indoor Navigation","Map-Matching"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WPNC.2008.4510357","publicationTitle":"2008 5th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4494447/4510344/04510357.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPNC.2008.4510357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integration of foot-mounted inertial sensors into a Bayesian location estimation framework","abstract":"An algorithm for integrating foot-mounted inertial sensors into a Bayesian location estimation framework is presented.

Since location based services become relevant for an increasing number of people, e. g. the location dependent automatic control of lighting, there is a need for unobtrusive and easy to use location systems. Especially in the field of healthcare, where the monitoring of elderly people becomes more and more important, such a system is mandatory. However, most of the existing solutions require people to wear a special hardware tag. To overcome this drawback, we propose a localization approach exploiting the thermal radiation of humans. For this purpose, existing sensor technologies are evaluated and the arising challenges and according counteractive measures are discussed. Finally, a simple triangulation based localization algorithm and the results of some early-stage experiments are presented.","doi":"10.1109/WPNC.2008.4510358","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4494447/4510344/04510358.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPNC.2008.4510358","publicationTitle":"2008 5th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","startPage":"63","endPage":"70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Challenges of passive infrared indoor localization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-27 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Challenges of passive infrared indoor localization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510358/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510358/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"10013453","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"27-27 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Challenges of passive infrared indoor localization","confLoc":"Hannover, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-04292008-00014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061105S","chronDate":"27-27 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4494447","isNumber":"4510344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4494447","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4510344","articleId":"4510358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4510394,"authors":[{"name":"Daisuke Umehara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University Yoshida-honmachi, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Daisuke Umehara","id":"37283471400"},{"name":"Taro Hayasaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University Yoshida-honmachi, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Taro Hayasaki","id":"37640329200"},{"name":"Satoshi Denno","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University Yoshida-honmachi, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Satoshi Denno","id":"37279596500"},{"name":"Masahiro Morikura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University Yoshida-honmachi, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Masahiro Morikura","id":"37282342000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1975-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1976-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4510394","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":702},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-varying channels","Power supplies","Programmable control","Frequency synchronization","Power line communications","Ethernet networks","Home automation","Power measurement","Noise measurement","Regulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","telecommunication power supplies","telecommunication switching","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-varying channels","commercial power supply","PLC equipments","power line communication","Japan","Ethernet signals","power line signals","in-home network","PLC adapters","power outlets","channel response","time-varying noise","switching regulators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["time-varying frequency response","cyclostationary noise","commercial power supply","switching regulator","time-frequency analysis","PLC equipments"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The influence of time-varying channels synchronized with commercial power supply on PLC equipments","abstract":"The regulation on power line communication (PLC) has been eased in Japan and the frequency band between 2 and 30 MHz can be exploited for in-home PLC. Several commercial PLC equipments are available in the market. Almost all PLC equipments take on a form of PLC adapters interconverting Ethernet signals and power line signals. We can construct in- home network by these PLC adapters easily because there are many power outlets in every room. However there are various factors destabilizing the communication among PLC adapters. These factors involve time-varying channel response and noise characteristics which are synchronized with commercial power supply. In particular, it has been seen that the noise on power line has significant variations rather than the channel response. Therefore, many PLC adapters are taking some measures to mitigate the time-varying noise on power line. On the other hand, we show a number of examples of more significant variations of the channel response synchronized with power supply due to some kinds of switching regulators. In this paper, we deal with such the time-varying channel response synchronized with commercial power supply. We show that the PLC adapters suffer from the time-varying channel response and analyze its influence on the PLC adapters.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510394","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492759/4510387/04510394.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2008.4510394","startPage":"30","endPage":"35","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2008.4510394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"The influence of time-varying channels synchronized with commercial power supply on PLC equipments","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4510394/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9964235","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The influence of time-varying channels synchronized with commercial power supply on PLC equipments","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SPI-04292008-00007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061985S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492759","isNumber":"4510387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492759","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4510387","articleId":"4510394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4510404,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel Moreno-Rodriguez","affiliation":["Parc Tecnol\u00f2gic, Design of Systems on Silicon, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Moreno-Rodriguez","id":"38321673100"},{"name":"Lars T.

In markets not served by DSL or cable, PLC can provides a cost-effective connectivity solution. Also known as \"third wire\" technology, PLC offer applications to rural and remote area in attractive modes like: i) high speed backbone over medium voltage power lines; ii) last mile access network through residential power distribution; Hi) last inch access to distribute data communication inside home. Considering the fact that network deployment costs can be reduced if signals are transmitted in an existing infrastructure, current status of PLC must be evaluated as an option to ICT efforts in rural and remote areas. This research targets to study the available technical benefits of PLC to rural applications as a backhaul, last mile or hybrid solution. Integration with current alternative technologies such as wireless and satellite communications can define an optimal solution according to individual community needs. Recommendations focused on municipalities or cooperatives are also discussed. Results indicate that PLC does not appear to represent a major disruptive technology in competitive markets, but very suitable for non supplied rural areas and should be considered strategically and technically for future policy decisions.","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2008.4510416","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492759/4510387/04510416.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2008.4510416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510387","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feasible connectivity solutions of PLC for rural and remote areas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510416/","displayDocTitle":"Feasible connectivity solutions of PLC for rural and remote areas","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510416/","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2008","accessionNumber":"9964273","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feasible connectivity solutions of PLC for rural and remote areas","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SPI-04292008-00029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054222S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492759","isNumber":"4510387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492759","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4510387","articleId":"4510416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4510420,"authors":[{"name":"Young Sun Lim","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young Sun Lim","id":"37067099100"},{"name":"Jae Sung Park","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Sung","lastName":"Park","id":"37066798000"},{"name":"Jin Young Kim","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin Young Kim","id":"38090923600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1975-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1976-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4510420","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":318},"abstract":"Frame synchronization is an critical factor for an effective operation of OFDM(orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) schemes.

One major aspect concerning AMR via power line communications (PLC) is the synchronization of communication systems. Common synchronization techniques are limited due to omnipresent, intensive and permanent disturbance, frequency or timing restrictions. In this paper, we analyze a synchronization scheme for power line modems with emphasis on systems deployed in the CENELEC bands (Oksa et al., 2006). First, the basic parameters of a proposed communication system on the basis of OFDM are presented. Thereby, the application and the design of guard intervals for elimination of synchronization errors are in the focus of the examination. Common synchronization strategies are discussed and the application of synchronization using the zero crossings (ZC) of the mains voltage is investigated. Extensive measurement campaigns will be analyzed in order to determine the potential as well as the issues with zero crossing synchronization. Concerning the OFDM systems, the dimension of the assumed guard interval is compared and verified with the results of zero crossing jitter measurements.","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2008.4510424","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492759/4510387/04510424.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2008.4510424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of zero crossing synchronization for OFDM-based AMR systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510424/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of zero crossing synchronization for OFDM-based AMR systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9964275","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510424/","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of zero crossing synchronization for OFDM-based AMR systems","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SPI-04292008-00037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059863S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492759","isNumber":"4510387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492759","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4510387","articleId":"4510424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4510425,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Bergaglio","affiliation":["Telecom Italia S.p.A., Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Bergaglio","id":"37869258100"},{"name":"Umberto Eula","affiliation":["Telecom Italia S.p.A., Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Umberto","lastName":"Eula","id":"37869263600"},{"name":"Mariano Giunta","affiliation":["Telecom Italia S.p.A., Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Mariano","lastName":"Giunta","id":"38070375400"},{"name":"Angelantonio Gnazzo","affiliation":["Telecom Italia S.p.A., Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Angelantonio","lastName":"Gnazzo","id":"37883684300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1975-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1976-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4510425","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"abstract":"Telecom operator are using powerline technology (PLC or PLT) inside home as a \"no new wire\" solution to deliver video service (IPTV) from the home gateway (HG) to the set top box (STB).

However, there are a lot of technical issues for the realization of PLC with high rate and high reliability. These issues include the influence of frequency selective and linear periodically time-variant (LPTV) channel synchronized with commercial power supply. In particular, we show that some kind of switching power devices impact deep and deterministic time selectivity for power line channels. The combination of OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) and bit loading algorithm is a powerful tool to increase the bit rate or reliability for quasi-static frequency selective channels including power line channels. However, a quick response will be required for the execution of bit loading algorithm since power line channels are synchronized with commercial power supply. In this paper, we propose a fast bit loading algorithm based on the fractional knapsack algorithm to enhance the bit rate under the condition that the transmitted power is constant. Furthermore, we evaluate the achievable bit rate of the proposed algorithm for the SNR over a power line channel and compare it with the achievable bit rate based on water filling theory.","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2008.4510450","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492759/4510387/04510450.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2008.4510450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510387","startPage":"336","endPage":"341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast bit loading algorithm synchronized with commercial power supply for in-home PLC systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A fast bit loading algorithm synchronized with commercial power supply for in-home PLC systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510450/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9964304","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4510450/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast bit loading algorithm synchronized with commercial power supply for in-home PLC systems","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SPI-04292008-00063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077123S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492759","isNumber":"4510387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492759","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4510387","articleId":"4510450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4510452,"authors":[{"name":"Fabricio P.

A two-state Markov channel model is adopted, which, unlike the memoryless models generally adopted in the literature, allows to describe the typical bursty nature of the impulse noise. We derive an algorithm for optimal maximum-a-posteriori symbol detection, which is first exploited for evaluating, by means of information-theoretical arguments, the ultimate performance limits imposed by the channel, and then is proposed as detection algorithm for practical communication systems employing iterative detection/decoding. The proposed scheme is finally shown to perform significantly better than the conventional ones which neglect the channel memory, and fairly close to the achievable theoretical limits.","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2008.4510454","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492759/4510387/04510454.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2008.4510454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510387","startPage":"357","endPage":"362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Reliable Communications over Channels Impaired by Bursty Impulse Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510454","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Reliable Communications over Channels Impaired by Bursty Impulse Noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510454/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9964254","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4510454/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Reliable Communications over Channels Impaired by Bursty Impulse Noise","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SPI-04292008-00067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08815S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492759","isNumber":"4510387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492759","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4510387","articleId":"4510454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4510455,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Lin","affiliation":["Research and Development Division, France Telecom, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37405075900"},{"name":"Chrislin Lele","affiliation":["Research and Development Division, France Telecom, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Chrislin","lastName":"Lele","id":"37571575700"},{"name":"Pierre Siohan","affiliation":["Research and Development Division, France Telecom, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Siohan","id":"37293775600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1975-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1976-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4510455","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":547},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","OFDM modulation","Programmable control","Pulse shaping methods","Baseband","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Shape","Channel estimation","Filter bank","Telecommunications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference cancellation","Hermitian symmetric OFDM system","Hermitian symmetric OQAM system","multicarrier modulation scheme","frequency selective channels","simple zero forcing","ZF equalization","baseband transmission","EIC equalization algorithm","channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"OFDM/OQAM is a multi-carrier modulation scheme that, differently from conventional OFDM, does not require any guard interval. Indeed, the interference that results from a transmission over time and/or frequency selective channels can be partly contained if the pulse shape has been appropriately selected. Nevertheless, for certain transmission conditions, a simple zero forcing (ZF) equalization is not enough to cancel this interference. In this paper, we propose an equalization with interference cancellation (EIC) to counteract the performance floor that characterizes OFDM/OQAM systems using a simple ZF equalization. To fit with the case of a baseband transmission, we use an OFDM/OQAM variant that satisfies Hermitian Symmetry conditions to directly provide a real-valued modulated signal. This modulation is evaluated for the transmission of 64 and 256- QAM over a power line communication (PLC) channel. The simulation results illustrate the efficiency of the EIC method.","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2008.4510455","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492759/4510387/04510455.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2008.4510455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510387","startPage":"363","endPage":"368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equalization with Interference Cancellation for Hermitian Symmetric OFDM/OQAM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Equalization with Interference Cancellation for Hermitian Symmetric OFDM/OQAM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510455/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9964255","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4510455/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equalization with Interference Cancellation for Hermitian Symmetric OFDM/OQAM systems","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SPI-04292008-00068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098931S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492759","isNumber":"4510387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492759","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4510387","articleId":"4510455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4510456,"authors":[{"name":"G.

To counter these impulses, powerline system use both error correction codes and retransmission request.

Simulation results present that the optimum signal level can significantly improve the performance of OFDM systems over power line channels with impulsive noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492759/4510387/04510459.pdf","startPage":"386","endPage":"390","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2008.4510459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2008.4510459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510387","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigation of effect of impulsive noise for OFDM systems over power line channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Gaussian noise","Additive white noise","Background noise","Noise level","Channel estimation","Power line communications","Phase shift keying","Programmable control","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","differential phase shift keying","impulse noise","OFDM modulation","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impulsive noise","OFDM systems","power line channels","performance degradation","differential MPSK"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power line communication (PLC)","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","impulsive noise","channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510459/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Mitigation of effect of impulsive noise for OFDM systems over power line channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510459/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9964259","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigation of effect of impulsive noise for OFDM systems over power line channels","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SPI-04292008-00072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076017S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492759","isNumber":"4510387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492759","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4510387","articleId":"4510459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4510464,"authors":[{"name":"Hui-Myoung Oh","affiliation":["Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Ansan, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hui-Myoung Oh","id":"37631309000"},{"name":"Sungsoo Choi","affiliation":["Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Ansan, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sungsoo Choi","id":"37310420100"},{"name":"Jae-Jo Lee","affiliation":["Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Ansan, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae-Jo Lee","id":"37422923300"},{"name":"Sugoog Shon","affiliation":["Suwon University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sugoog Shon","id":"37529193900"},{"name":"Hyo Suk Kim","affiliation":["Suwon University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyo Suk Kim","id":"38089909200"},{"name":"Dong Seok In","affiliation":["Suwon University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong Seok In","id":"37640292200"},{"name":"Jinseok Bae","affiliation":["Korean Agency of Technology and Standards, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jinseok Bae","id":"38081806100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1975-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1976-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4510464","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":712},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupler with transformer for impedance matching on mv power distribution line for BPLC","abstract":"In this paper, the couplers with transformers for the purpose of impedance matching at signal input terminal of Medium Voltage(MV) power distribution lines for Broadband Power Line Communication(BPLC) which used in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 35 MHz have been designed, and the performance of those has been verified experimentally. In fact, the input impedance values of MV power distribution lines have been obtained between 200Omega and 300Omega[6]. In the range of these values, we have designed the transformers with general specific values of impedance: 50Omega, 112Omega, 253Omega, 356Omega, and 450Omega by utilizing the Ruthroffs transmission line transformer method[7]. The most proper transformer, matching well is embedded in a coupler and is implemented to transfer a transmitting signal with maximum power into the MV distribution lines. The performance of the designed coupler with a transformer is verified through measuring the reflection characteristics and signal attenuation in given MV test field. The measured results have informed that the couplers with transformers with impedance values of 253Omega or 356Omega have represented the best performance of them.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance matching","Power distribution lines","Signal design","Couplings","Medium voltage","Broadband communication","Frequency","Power transmission lines","Attenuation measurement","Transmission line measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","carrier transmission on power lines","impedance matching","power distribution lines","power transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medium voltage power distribution line","impedance matching","broadband power line communication","Ruthroff transmission line transformer method","signal attenuation","frequency 1 MHz to 35 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coupler","Transformer","Ruthroff\u2019s Model Impedance Matching","Medium Voltage Power Distribution Line","Power Line Communication"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510464","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2008.4510464","startPage":"409","endPage":"412","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492759/4510387/04510464.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2008.4510464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510464/","displayDocTitle":"Coupler with transformer for impedance matching on mv power distribution line for BPLC","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9964288","htmlLink":"/document/4510464/","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupler with transformer for impedance matching on mv power distribution line for BPLC","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SPI-04292008-00077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04694S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492759","isNumber":"4510387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492759","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4510387","articleId":"4510464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4510476,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Often, the applied phase voltage is reconstructed by using a combination of the DC link voltage and the commanded PWM duty cycle. Another approach is to apply a low-pass filter to the phase voltage to remove the high frequency PWM switching component, but leaving the fundamental component of interest. In this paper, a strategy for detecting the instantaneous phase voltage is presented. The approach consists of integrating the switched phase voltage over either a full, or half PWM cycle. The integrated signal is then converted to voltage by dividing by the integrating period. Implementation details of the proposed approach are outlined in the paper, and experimental results are used to compare the proposed technique with other methods of voltage measurement in terms of measurement accuracy and transient performance. The results will demonstrate the opportunity for improvements to any inverter-driven motor control system that relies on accurate terminal voltage measurement to estimate internal machine states.","doi":"10.1109/ACEMP.2007.4510497","publicationTitle":"2007 International Aegean Conference on Electrical Machines and Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Aegean Conference on Electrical Machines and Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492963/4510466/04510497.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACEMP.2007.4510497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510466","startPage":"168","endPage":"173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instantaneous voltage measurement in PWM voltage source inverters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Instantaneous voltage measurement in PWM voltage source inverters","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510497/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10013978","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4510497/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instantaneous voltage measurement in PWM voltage source inverters","confLoc":"Bodrum, Turkey","sourcePdf":"SPI-04302008-00031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034242S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4492963","isNumber":"4510466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492963","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4510466","articleId":"4510497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4510499,"authors":[{"name":"Ayse Kocalmis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Firat University, Elazig, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ayse","lastName":"Kocalmis","id":"37300497100"},{"name":"Sedat Sunter","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Firat University, Elazig, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sedat","lastName":"Sunter","id":"37292159500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0890-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0891-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4510499","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":345},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation inverters","Neural networks","Space vector pulse width modulation","Voltage","Artificial neural networks","Diodes","Switched capacitor circuits","Mathematical model","Pulse width modulation converters","Manufacturing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","power engineering computing","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","space vector PWM algorithm","multi-level inverters","space vector pulse width modulation technique","three-level inverter","induction motor load"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510499","abstract":"In this paper, application of an artificial neural network (ANN) based space vector pulse width modulation technique (SVPWM) to a three-level inverter has been realized.

Data obtained from angle, current, flux and torque components obtained through FEM analysis of MCSRM has been used in ANN training. In the course of literature research, no use of ANN in MCSRM modeling is detected and it is seen that algorithms consisting of analytical methods are preferred. It is established that, in modeling studies which are based on such algorithms, the structure consists of thousands of loops and that these loops extend time needed for simulation; besides, it is seen that installation of loops in modeling become rather difficult. The data obtained from dynamic analysis of the model are compared with the data obtained from motor tests in the literature and it is witnessed that the model produces similar torques in similar voltage and current forms.","doi":"10.1109/ACEMP.2007.4510569","startPage":"849","endPage":"852","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Aegean Conference on Electrical Machines and Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492963/4510466/04510569.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Aegean Conference on Electrical Machines and Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACEMP.2007.4510569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling MCSRM with artificial neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Reluctance machines","Reluctance motors","Mutual coupling","Feeds","Torque","Algorithm design and analysis","Analytical models","Testing","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","electric motors","finite element analysis","neural nets","power engineering computing","reluctance machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mutually couple switched reluctance machine","feed forward back propagation","artificial neural network","FEM analysis","MCSRM modeling","dynamic analysis","electrical motor","finite element method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Modeling MCSRM with artificial neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510569/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10013925","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling MCSRM with artificial neural network","confLoc":"Bodrum, Turkey","sourcePdf":"SPI-04302008-00103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064585S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4492963","isNumber":"4510466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492963","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4510466","articleId":"4510569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4510576,"authors":[{"name":"Erkan Duman","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Firat University, Elazig, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erkan","lastName":"Duman","id":"38078720000"},{"name":"Hayrettin Can","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Firat University, Elazig, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hayrettin","lastName":"Can","id":"38080250800"},{"name":"Erhan Akin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Firat University, Elazig, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erhan","lastName":"Akin","id":"37424622900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0890-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0891-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4510576","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":393},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Induction machines","Hardware","Induction motors","Real time systems","Design engineering","Mathematical model","Digital signal processing","Computational modeling","Differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","induction motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","induction machine model","field programmable gate array","hardware-in-the-loop simulation","electrical machines","induction motor","state-space representation","differential equations","floating point number system"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the real-time hardware implementation of three-phase induction motor modelling, using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device, in order to use in real-time simulations. The proposed model runs directly in hardware by using FPGA technology and it allows a remarkable speed up in comparison with conventional models which based only software. Such a model was developed with the aim of meeting the real-time simulations needs while solving the limitations of traditional solutions, in particular for hardware-in-the-loop simulation of electrical machines and systems. In the previous studies, this technology had been only used to implement I/O processes of simulations due to insufficient devices having the constraints about the size and the number of the general purposed ports. However in more recent times, higher densities, higher speed and cost advantages have enabled the use of such devices in a wider variety of applications. In this paper, we defined the three- phase induction motor by state-space representation which models a system as a set of differential equations using matrix form. Therefore our system was transformed into an application of real-time matrix multiplication in FPGA using floating point number system. We utilized Quartus-II environment to develop FPGA designs and then download these design files into our development kit.","doi":"10.1109/ACEMP.2007.4510576","publicationTitle":"2007 International Aegean Conference on Electrical Machines and Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Aegean Conference on Electrical Machines and Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492963/4510466/04510576.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACEMP.2007.4510576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510466","startPage":"603","endPage":"606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real time FPGA implementation of induction machine model - a novel approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real time FPGA implementation of induction machine model - a novel approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510576/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10014026","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4510576/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real time FPGA implementation of induction machine model - a novel approach","confLoc":"Bodrum, Turkey","sourcePdf":"SPI-04302008-00110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063509S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4492963","isNumber":"4510466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492963","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4510466","articleId":"4510576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4510580,"authors":[{"name":"Tahir Sag","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Computer Education, Faculty of Technical Education, Sel\u00e7uk University, Konya, Turkey"],"firstName":"Tahir","lastName":"Sag","id":"37086256796"},{"name":"Mehmet Cunkas","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Computer Education, Faculty of Technical Education, Sel\u00e7uk University, Konya, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Cunkas","id":"38017079400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0890-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0891-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4510580","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510580","abstract":"In order to simplify the offline identification of induction motor parameters, a method based on optimization using a multiobjective genetic algorithm is proposed.

The optimal multiuser transmission, which is known as dirty paper coding, is not directly realizable. Moreover, close-to-optimal solutions such as Tomlinson-Harashima precoding are sensitive to channel state information (CSI) inaccuracy. This paper considers a more practical design called per user unitary and rate control (PU2RC), which has been proposed for emerging cellular standards. PU2RC supports multiuser simultaneous transmission, enables limited feedback, and is capable of exploiting multiuser diversity. Its key feature is an orthogonal beamforming (or precoding) constraint, where each user selects a beamformer (or precoder) from a codebook of multiple orthonormal bases. In this paper, the asymptotic throughput scaling laws for PU2RC with a large user pool are derived for different regimes of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the multiuser interference-limited regime, the throughput of PU2RC is shown to logarithmically scale with the number of users. In the normal SNR and noise-limited regimes, the throughput is found to scale double logarithmically with the number of users and linearly with the number of antennas at the base station. In addition, numerical results show that PU2RC achieves higher throughput and is more robust against CSI quantization errors than the popular alternative of zero-forcing beamforming if the number of users is sufficiently large.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.925003","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4749378/04510711.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.925003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Orthogonal Beamforming for SDMA With Limited Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510711","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510711/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Orthogonal Beamforming for SDMA With Limited Feedback","volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10391723","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510711/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Orthogonal Beamforming for SDMA With Limited Feedback","sourcePdf":"58tvt01-huang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10669S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4749378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"163","xplore-issue":"4749378","articleId":"4510711","onlineDate":"07 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4510712,"authors":[{"name":"Shreeram Sigdel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta and TRLabs, Edmonton, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4802057/4510712/4510712-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shreeram Sigdel (M'08) received the B.Eng. degree in electronics engineering from the Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal, in 1998, the M.Eng. degree in telecommunications engineering from the Asian Institute of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2008.","He is currently with TRLabs, Edmonton.

We propose simplified algorithms for channel-aware multiuser scheduling in conjunction with receive antenna selection for two downlink multiuser orthogonal space-division multiplexing techniques: block diagonalization and successive optimization. The algorithms greedily maximize the weighted sum rate. The algorithms add the best user at a time from the set of users that are not selected yet to the set of selected users until the desired number of users has been selected. To apply the proportional fairness criterion, simplified user scheduling metrics are proposed for block diagonalization and successive optimization. Two receive antenna selection algorithms are also proposed, which further enhance the power gain of the equivalent single-user channel after orthogonal precoding by selecting a subset of the receive antennas that contributes the most toward the total power gain of the channel. A user grouping technique is used to further lower the complexity of the selection algorithms. We compare various multiuser MIMO scheduling strategies that are applied to block diagonalization and successive optimization transmission techniques through simulation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in ensuring throughput fairness among users. Results also show that when the number of users is large, the proposed scheduling algorithms perform close to the exhaustive search algorithms and previously proposed greedy scheduling algorithms, but with much lower complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.925002","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4802057/04510712.pdf","startPage":"1329","endPage":"1344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.925002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4802057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified Fair Scheduling and Antenna Selection Algorithms for Multiuser MIMO Orthogonal Space-Division Multiplexing Downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510712/","displayDocTitle":"Simplified Fair Scheduling and Antenna Selection Algorithms for Multiuser MIMO Orthogonal Space-Division Multiplexing Downlink","volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10520149","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510712/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified Fair Scheduling and Antenna Selection Algorithms for Multiuser MIMO Orthogonal Space-Division Multiplexing Downlink","sourcePdf":"58tvt03-sigdel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132434S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4802057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4802057","articleId":"4510712","onlineDate":"07 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4510713,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Ielmini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Italian Universities Nanoelectronics Team, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Ielmini","id":"37275690700"},{"name":"Davide Mantegazza","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Italian Universities Nanoelectronics Team, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Mantegazza","id":"37293791000"},{"name":"Andrea L.

The statistical parameters of the propagation channel, such as the number of paths, the RMS delay spread, the path loss, and the shadowing, are inspected. Moreover, the interdependencies of different characteristics of the multipath channel are also investigated. A linear relationship between the number of paths and the delay spread is found, negative cross correlation between the shadow fading and the delay spread can be established, and an upper bound exponential model of the delay spread and the path loss is developed to estimate the worst case of the RMS delay spread at given path loss. Based on the DOA measurements that are carried out in a room [line of sight (LOS)] and in a corridor with both LOS and nonline-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, radio-wave propagation mechanisms are studied. It is found that considering the direct wave and the first-order reflected waves from smooth surfaces is sufficient in the LOS cases. Transmission loss is very high; however, diffraction is found to be a significant propagation mechanism in NLOS propagation environments. The results can be used for the design of 60-GHz radio systems in short-range wireless applications.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.924990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.924990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4749378/04510717.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Propagation Channel Characterization for Short-Range Wireless Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Propagation Channel Characterization for Short-Range Wireless Communications","volume":"58","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510717/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10399797","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510717/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-Wave Propagation Channel Characterization for Short-Range Wireless Communications","sourcePdf":"58tvt01-geng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083554S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4749378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"233","xplore-issue":"4749378","articleId":"4510717","onlineDate":"07 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4510719,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Bo Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China","National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4749378/4510719/4510719-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun-Bo Wang was born in Hefei, China, in 1979.

This paper is focused on the uplink scheduling of CDMA nonreal-time data. In practical CDMA systems, data can only be transmitted with a few fixed transmission rates. Moreover, to guarantee receiving accuracy, the actual received signal-power-to-interference-plus-noise-power ratio (SINR) is expected to be no less than the target SINR value. Using Heaviside unit step functions, the relationship between the actual SINR value and the actual available maximum transmission rate is described in the proposed system model. Based on the proposed system model, an integer optimization problem is formulated to simultaneously maximize the throughput and the scheduling efficiency. Particularly, an ant-colony-optimization (ACO)-based scheduling algorithm is proposed to solve the proposed optimization problem. The computational complexity analysis indicates that the proposed ACO-based scheduling algorithm is computationally efficient in terms of both running time and storage space. In addition, the numerical results show that the proposed optimization problem is more efficient at guiding the development of scheduling algorithms for uplink CDMA nonreal-time data. Moreover, the proposed ACO-based scheduling algorithm performs quite well in terms of quality, running time, and stability.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.924983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4749378/04510719.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.924983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ant-Colony-Optimization-Based Scheduling Algorithm for Uplink CDMA Nonreal-Time Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510719/","displayDocTitle":"Ant-Colony-Optimization-Based Scheduling Algorithm for Uplink CDMA Nonreal-Time Data","volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10391726","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510719/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ant-Colony-Optimization-Based Scheduling Algorithm for Uplink CDMA Nonreal-Time Data","sourcePdf":"58tvt01-jwang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074323S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4749378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4749378","articleId":"4510719","onlineDate":"07 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4510723,"authors":[{"name":"Lingyang Song","affiliation":["RH1 5HA Surrey, Philips Research Laboratories, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4802057/4510723/4510723-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lingyang Song (M'07) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Jilin University, Changchun, China, 2002 and the Ph.D. degree from the University of York, York, U.K., 2007.","From January 2003 to September 2003, he was a Software Engineer with Hwasun Tomorrow Technology, Beijing, China.

By using decision feedback equalization (DFE), Gaussian approximation, a prewhitening filter, and a matched filter, the proposed PWD transforms the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system into several parallel single-input-single-output (SISO) schemes and facilitates single-symbol detection. The proposed scheme achieves near-optimal symbol recovery with a complexity similar to that of a minimum-mean-square-error decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE). The closed-form symbol error rate (SER) of the PWD is derived, which can be used to closely predict the ML performance for uncoded V-BLAST schemes. By assuming full channel knowledge at the transmitter side, we use a preequalizer and a precoder in a downlink scenario. The preequalizer can transfer the feedback part of the DFE to the transmitter side and thus provide better performance in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with reduced receiver complexity. The precoder designed to minimize the SER of this system can further improve performance without affecting the complexity at the receiver side.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.924991","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.924991","startPage":"1345","endPage":"1354","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4802057/04510723.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4802057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transceiver Design for Spatial Multiplexing Based on Prewhitening Detector","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Transceiver Design for Spatial Multiplexing Based on Prewhitening Detector","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","volume":"58","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510723/","accessionNumber":"10520146","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510723/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transceiver Design for Spatial Multiplexing Based on Prewhitening Detector","sourcePdf":"58tvt03-song.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106495S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4802057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4802057","articleId":"4510723","onlineDate":"07 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4510724,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel A.

However, this is not true in most practical situations, and it is a common approach to overestimate the channel order to avoid the serious performance degradation that occurs when the CIR length is underestimated. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of maximum-likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) in frequency-selective channels exponentially grows with the channel order; hence, overestimation can actually be undesirable because it leads to more expensive and inefficient receivers. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for MLSD that incorporates the full estimation of the MIMO CIR parameters, including its order.

By studying the Cramer-Rao lower bound as well as the performance of a minimum-mean-square-error-based interpolator, we show that the interleaved subcarriers make it possible for the base station to obtain accurate instantaneous downlink channel state information (CSI) from uplink channel measurements. However, the interleaved uplink and downlink subcarriers could introduce interference leakage when the intersubcarrier orthogonality is destroyed in multiple-cell environments. We address this issue by analyzing the uplink-to-downlink power leakage and show that with proper system configuration, such interference only has a marginal effect in typical land mobile radio environments. Finally, by considering maximum ratio transmission as an example, we demonstrate the benefit of knowing instantaneous downlink CSI in multiple-antenna Zipper OFDM systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4783256/04510725.pdf","startPage":"800","endPage":"814","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.924997","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.924997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783256","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Zipper OFDM Multiple-Antenna Technique for Interleaved-FDD Cellular Communication Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Downlink","Interference","Channel state information","Mobile communication","Frequency division multiplexing","Wireless communication","Radio transmitters","GSM","Interleaved codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","multifrequency antennas","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zipper OFDM multiple-antenna technique","interleaved-FDD cellular communication systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","Cramer-Rao lower bound","minimum-mean-square-error-based interpolator","channel state information","uplink channel measurements","interleaved uplink subcarriers","interleaved downlink subcarriers","typical land mobile radio environments","maximum ratio transmission","frequency-domain duplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular communication","instantaneous channel state information (CSI)","interleaved frequency-domain duplexing (FDD)","maximum ratio transmission (MRT)"]},{"kwd":["Interleaved Frequency Domain Duplexing (FDD)","Cellular Communication","Instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI)","Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Zipper OFDM Multiple-Antenna Technique for Interleaved-FDD Cellular Communication Systems","volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4510725/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475162","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Zipper OFDM Multiple-Antenna Technique for Interleaved-FDD Cellular Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"58tvt02-xue.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12216S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4783256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"4783256","articleId":"4510725","onlineDate":"07 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4510751,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Yang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280196900"},{"name":"Xiuyi Zhou","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiuyi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37696501800"},{"name":"Marek Chrobak","affiliation":["Computer Science, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Chrobak","id":"37828433000"},{"name":"Youtao Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Youtao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38183309800"},{"name":"Lingling Jin","affiliation":["TNvidia Corporate, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Lingling","lastName":"Jin","id":"37553732500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2232-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2233-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4510751","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":70,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":901},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thermal management","Dynamic scheduling","Hardware","Scheduling algorithm","Temperature measurement","Temperature sensors","Processor scheduling","Microprocessors","Energy consumption","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Linux","microprocessor chips","power aware computing","processor scheduling","task analysis","thermal management (packaging)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic thermal management","task scheduling","microprocessors","power consumption","heat generation speed on-die","voltage scaling","frequency scaling","thermal-aware job scheduling","heuristic algorithm","Linux kernel"]}],"abstract":"The evolution of microprocessors has been hindered by their increasing power consumption and the heat generation speed on-die. High temperature impairs the processor's reliability and reduces its lifetime. While hardware level dynamic thermal management (DTM) techniques, such as voltage and frequency scaling, can effectively lower the chip temperature when it surpasses the thermal threshold, they inevitably come at the cost of performance degradation. We propose an OS level technique that performs thermal- aware job scheduling to reduce the number of thermal trespasses. Our scheduler reduces the amount of hardware DTMs and achieves higher performance while keeping the temperature low. Our methods leverage the natural discrepancies in thermal behavior among different workloads, and schedule them to keep the chip temperature below a given budget. We develop a heuristic algorithm based on the observation that there is a difference in the resulting temperature when a hot and a cool job are executed in a different order. To evaluate our scheduling algorithms, we developed a lightweight runtime temperature monitor to enable informed scheduling decisions. We have implemented our scheduling algorithm and the entire temperature monitoring framework in the Linux kernel. Our proposed scheduler can remove 10.5-73.6% of the hardware DTMs in various combinations of workloads in a medium thermal environment. As a result, the CPU throughput was improved by up to 7.6% (4.1% on average) even under a severe thermal environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Thermal Management through Task Scheduling","publicationTitle":"ISPASS 2008 - IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and software","doi":"10.1109/ISPASS.2008.4510751","displayPublicationTitle":"ISPASS 2008 - IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and software","pdfPath":"/iel5/4498398/4510727/04510751.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPASS.2008.4510751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510727","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Thermal Management through Task Scheduling","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510751/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9982629","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Thermal Management through Task Scheduling","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ISPASS-00-24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093129S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4498398","isNumber":"4510727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4498398","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4510727","articleId":"4510751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4510754,"authors":[{"name":"Jizhu Lu","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

The main challenge in implementing the Plan7 Viterbi algorithm on the novel Cell/B.E. multiprocessor is the limited local storage space of the Cell/B.E. SPEs (synergistic processing element). We describe our approach to modifying the Viterbi algorithm to reduce the space complexity from 0(M*N) to O(N). We then proceed to discuss design considerations such as task parallelization and code partitioning, in addition to other optimizations we used to implement HMMer-Cell.

Significant attention has been drawn to the mitigation of the NLOS effect in recent years. This paper focuses on the identification of NLOS conditions by employing the statistical decision theory. A Neyman-Pearson (NP) test method is first derived for scenarios where either 1-D or 2-D angular measurements are provided. A time-of-arrival (TOA) based method is then developed under idealized conditions to provide a performance reference. In the presence of both TOA and received signal strength (RSS) measurements, a joint identification method is derived to efficiently exploit the TOA and RSS measurements. Analytical expressions of the probability of detection (POD) and the probability of false alarm (PFA) are derived for all the scenarios considered. Two theorems and one corollary regarding the line-of-sight (LOS) conditions based on the angle of arrival (AOA) are also presented, and the proofs are provided. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods perform well, and the joint TOA- and RSS-based method considerably outperforms the TOA-based methods.

This is true even when all receive antennas are equipped with radio frequency (RF) chains and RAS reduces the upper bound on the broadcast sum capacity, and when the orthogonalized channels use optimal processing. Similarly, spatial-mode selection (SMS) is necessary for sum rate maximization when receive-weight matrices are used for spatial-mode allocation. RAS/SMS may release transmission resources that can fully be utilized via additional user scheduling to yield further sum rate gains. Optimal user selection for sum rate maximization is subsumed within an exhaustive RAS/SMS process for multiantenna terminals, and both selection processes become identical for single-antenna terminals. RAS/SMS thus helps reduce the performance gap from the optimal sum capacity even for small user pool sizes. A block antenna/mode selection approach is introduced to help overcome the drawbacks of existing algorithms. Since RAS/SMS involves antenna/mode ranking, a systematic method for resource allocation with sum rate loss minimization is inherently provided. This way, a streamlined process that combines user selection, RAS/SMS, and resource allocation is developed for sum rate maximization of block-diagonalized SDM.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.924973","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4749378/04510770.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.924973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749378","startPage":"478","endPage":"484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Sum Rate Maximization and Resource Allocation in Block-Diagonalized Space-Division Multiplexing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Sum Rate Maximization and Resource Allocation in Block-Diagonalized Space-Division Multiplexing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510770/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10414923","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4510770/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Sum Rate Maximization and Resource Allocation in Block-Diagonalized Space-Division Multiplexing","sourcePdf":"58tvt01-lim-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.429138S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4749378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4749378","articleId":"4510770","onlineDate":"07 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4510771,"authors":[{"name":"Noor Shamsiah Othman","affiliation":["University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Noor Shamsiah","lastName":"Othman","id":"37565923300"},{"name":"Mohammed El-Hajjar","affiliation":["University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"El-Hajjar","id":"38276919800"},{"name":"Osamah Alamri","affiliation":["University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Osamah","lastName":"Alamri","id":"37299804500"},{"name":"Soon Xin Ng","affiliation":["University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Soon Xin","lastName":"Ng","id":"37287759500"},{"name":"Lajos Hanzo","affiliation":["University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Hanzo","id":"37276255400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4510771","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative AMR-WB Source and Channel Decoding Using Differential Space\u2013Time Spreading-Assisted Sphere-Packing Modulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4749378/04510771.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.924977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749378","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.924977","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","MIMO","Resilience","Wideband","Speech codecs","Speech coding","Protection","Convolutional codes","Convolution","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","MIMO communication","source coding","speech codecs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive multirate wideband speech codec","channel decoding","source decoding","differential space-time spreading-assisted sphere-packing modulation","recursive systematic convolutional code","multiple-input-multiple-output differential space-time spreading","Rayleigh fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive multirate wideband (AMR-WB) speech codec","differential space\u2013time spreading (DSTS)","soft-bit-based iterative speech decoding","sphere decoder","sphere-packing (SP) modulation","three-stage iterative detection","turbo"]},{"kwd":["AMR-WB Speech Codec","Differential Space-Time Spreading","Soft Bit Based Iterative Speech Decoding","Sphere Decoder","Sphere Packing modulation","Three Stage Iterative Detection","Turbo"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510771","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel system that invokes jointly optimized iterative source and channel decoding for enhancing the error resilience of the adaptive multirate wideband (AMR-WB) speech codec.

(2001) which considered the corresponding homogeneous-user case. The channel's bandwidth is to be dynamically allocated to different users, based on partial information on their connectivity status. During each time slot, a user may or may not be connected to the base station, where the Gilbert-Elliott model is assumed that a user's connectivity evolves as a two-state (on-off) Markov chain. Transmitting from/to a user reveals its true connectivity status, while those of other users are only partially known by tracking their probabilities of being connected. The goal is to design a tractable dynamic channel allocation policy that comes close to maximizing the infinite-horizon discounted or long-run average value of the through put minus transmission costs. The paper exploits a restless bandit problem formulation drawing on and extending to the Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) setting the powerful indexation theory introduced by Whittle (1988) and developed by the author, to obtain a new dynamic priority-index policy that is readily implementable. Computational results are presented showing that the proposed policy can substantially outperform the conventional greedy policy in instances with two heterogeneous users.","doi":"10.1109/NGI.2008.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510772","startPage":"231","endPage":"238","pdfPath":"/iel5/4510695/4510772/04510810.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Next Generation Internet Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Next Generation Internet Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGI.2008.38","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Index Policy for Dynamic Fading-Channel Allocation to Heterogeneous Mobile Users with Partial Observations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Bandwidth","Channel allocation","Downlink","Statistics","Electronic mail","World Wide Web","Costs","Autocorrelation","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","channel allocation","fading channels","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic fading-channel allocation","partial observations","multiple heterogeneous mobile users","wireless channel","base station","homogeneous-user case","dynamical channel bandwidth allocation","partial information","Gilbert-Elliott model","Markov chain","tractable dynamic channel allocation policy","bandit problem formulation","partially observed Markov decision process","dynamic priority-index policy","greedy policy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"An Index Policy for Dynamic Fading-Channel Allocation to Heterogeneous Mobile Users with Partial Observations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510810/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510810/","accessionNumber":"9963161","publicationDate":"April 2008","conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Index Policy for Dynamic Fading-Channel Allocation to Heterogeneous Mobile Users with Partial Observations","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"08NGS6P3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137459S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4510695","isNumber":"4510772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4510695","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4510772","articleId":"4510810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4510845,"authors":[{"name":"Youshen Xia","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4588974/4510845/4510845-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\nYoushen Xia (M'96\u2013SM'00) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computational mathematics from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 1982 and 1989, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Automation and Computer-Aided Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, China, in 2000.","Currently, he is the Professor at the College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China.

Thus, these two elements must be taken into account in order to provide a relevant diagnosis of these electrical systems. In this context, the paper presents a diagnosis method based on a multidimensional function and pattern recognition (PR). Traditional formalism of the PR method has been extended with some improvements such as the automatic choice of the feature space dimension or a ldquononexclusiverdquo decision rule based on the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n-nearest neighbors. Thus, we introduce a new membership function, which takes into account the number of nearest neighbors as well as the distance from these neighbors with the sample to be classified. This approach is illustrated on a 5.5 kW inverter-fed asynchronous motor, in order to detect supply and motor faults. In this application, diagnostic features are only extracted from electrical measurements. Experimental results prove the efficiency of our diagnosis method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Detection and Diagnosis in a Set \u201cInverter\u2013Induction Machine\u201d Through Multidimensional Membership Function and Pattern Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2008.921559","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4957563/04510860.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2008.921559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957563","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510860/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Fault Detection and Diagnosis in a Set \u201cInverter\u2013Induction Machine\u201d Through Multidimensional Membership Function and Pattern Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4510860/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664069","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Detection and Diagnosis in a Set \u201cInverter\u2013Induction Machine\u201d Through Multidimensional Membership Function and Pattern Recognition","sourcePdf":"tec-ondel-921559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137604S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"4957563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4957563","articleId":"4510860","onlineDate":"10 June 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4510862,"authors":[{"name":"N.

A new heterostructure design with low capacitance, low resistance, and high curvature coefficient as compared to previous designs is presented. Voltage sensitivity, which is directly proportional to curvature coefficient, is improved by 31% as compared to prior reports of devices with similar barrier thicknesses. The junction capacitance is also reduced by 24% to 13 . The improved sensitivity and decreased junction capacitance originate from the incorporation of a p-type-doping plane with sheet concentration of in the n-InAs cathode layer. The combination of low resistance (and thus Johnson noise) and high sensitivity results in an estimated noise equivalent power of 0.24 at 94 GHz for a conjugately matched source, whereas the reduced capacitance facilitates wideband matching and increases the detector cutoff frequency.

Power injection from the PV system will raise the voltage at the power distribution line. A power conditioning subsystem (PCS) needs to regulate its output if the voltage becomes higher than the upper limit in order to avoid the overvoltage at the power grid. Thus, a PV system cannot generate electricity under the high grid voltage. There are 553 residential PV systems installed in Ota, Japan, for the demonstration research project of clustered PV systems. Measurement data of these 2.1-MW grid-connected PV systems are used for the analysis. Only the limited number of PV systems experienced a significant amount of output energy loss due to the high grid voltage in a particular day, whereas the other system's outputs also raise the grid voltage. The causes of this maldistribution of the output energy loss are the difference of the line impedance, the difference of the starting voltage of the PCS's grid overvoltage protection function, and the imbalance of the load in single-phase three-wire power distribution systems. The present control of the PCS successfully avoids the overvoltage on the grid but cannot share the loss.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.924447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4550662/04510865.pdf","startPage":"2744","endPage":"2751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.924447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4550662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis Results of Output Power Loss Due to the Grid Voltage Rise in Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Power Generation Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510865/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis Results of Output Power Loss Due to the Grid Voltage Rise in Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Power Generation Systems","volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10074577","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510865/","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis Results of Output Power Loss Due to the Grid Voltage Rise in Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Power Generation Systems","sourcePdf":"55tie07-ueda.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095064S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4550662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"4550662","articleId":"4510865","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4510918,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Nissinen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Electronics Laboratory, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Nissinen","id":"37274072900"},{"name":"Juha Kostamovaara","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Electronics Laboratory, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Juha","lastName":"Kostamovaara","id":"37273978100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1377-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1378-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4510918","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":217},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510918","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser radar","Dynamic range","Pulse measurements","Optical pulses","Timing","Pulse amplifiers","Image edge detection","Optical receivers","Gain control","Space vector pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laser ranging","optical radar","radar receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated laser radar receiver channel","pulsed time-of-flight laser rangefinder","leading edge detection"]}],"abstract":"A Receiver channel for a pulsed time-of-flight laser rangefinder is presented.

This paper introduces the preliminary result of the modeling and simulation of photovoltaic panel based on ANN and VHDL-language. In fact, an experimental database of meteorological data (irradiation, temperature) and output electrical generation signals of the PV-panel (current and voltage) has been used in this study. The inputs of the ANN-PV-panel are the daily total irradiation and mean average temperature while the outputs are the current and voltage generated from the panel. Firstly, a dataset of 4 x 364 have been used for training the network and then one year is used for testing the ANN model. Subsequently, the neural network (MLP) corresponding to PV-panel is implemented using VHDL language based on the saved weights and bias of the network. Simulation results of the trained MLP-PV panel based on Matlab and VHDL are presented. The proposed PV-panel model based ANN and VHDL permit to evaluate the performance PV-panel using only the environmental factors and involves less computational efforts, and it can be used for predicting the output electrical energy from the PV-panel.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2007.4510930","startPage":"58","endPage":"61","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456901/4510892/04510930.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2007.4510930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and simulation of photovoltaic panel based on artificial neural networks and VHDL-language","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation","Artificial neural networks","Mathematical model","Temperature","Voltage","Databases","Meteorology","Signal generators","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware description languages","mathematics computing","multilayer perceptrons","power engineering computing","solar cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photovoltaic panel simulation","artificial neural networks","VHDL language","output electrical energy prediction","multilayer perceptron network","Matlab"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and simulation of photovoltaic panel based on artificial neural networks and VHDL-language","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510930/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9856408","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and simulation of photovoltaic panel based on artificial neural networks and VHDL-language","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"ICECS-00-38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058188S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4456901","isNumber":"4510892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456901","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4510892","articleId":"4510930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4510932,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Demosthenous","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Demosthenous","id":"37272203700"},{"name":"Ioannis Pachnis","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Pachnis","id":"37542933700"},{"name":"Mohamad Rahal","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Mohamad","lastName":"Rahal","id":"37322417100"},{"name":"Dai Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Dai","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37275554700"},{"name":"Nick Donaldson","affiliation":["Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Donaldson","id":"37294920100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1377-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1378-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4510932","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":185},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510932","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromyography","Electrodes","Impedance","Bridge circuits","Educational institutions","Implants","Neuromuscular stimulation","Interference","Instruments","Low-noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","BiCMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ENG amplifier","electroneurogram","passive EMG neutralization","BiCMOS process technology"]}],"abstract":"We describe an implantable electroneurogram (ENG) amplifier dedicated to incontinence and other functional electrical stimulation applications.

Optimizing the power efficiency of the wireless link is imperative to minimize the size of the external energy source, electromagnetic heating of the tissue, and interference with other devices. In this paper, we outline the theoretical foundation of optimal power transmission in an inductive link and combine it with semi- empirical models to predict parasitic components in PSCs. Moreover, this foundation is utilized to devise an iterative PSC design methodology to find optimal PSC geometries. Finally, we have executed this procedure on two design examples at 1 and 5 MHz achieving power transmission efficiencies of 41.2% and 85.8%, respectively, at 10 mm spacing.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2007.4510933","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456901/4510892/04510933.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2007.4510933","publicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","startPage":"70","endPage":"73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Optimization of Printed Spiral Coils for Efficient Inductive Power Transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design and Optimization of Printed Spiral Coils for Efficient Inductive Power Transmission","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4510933/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4510933/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9856411","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Optimization of Printed Spiral Coils for Efficient Inductive Power Transmission","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"ICECS-00-41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040857S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4456901","isNumber":"4510892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456901","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4510892","articleId":"4510933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":4510942,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Papandreou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras, Rio-Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Papandreou","id":"37276934000"},{"name":"Theodore Antonakopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras, Rio-Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Theodore","lastName":"Antonakopoulos","id":"37276921000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1377-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1378-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4510942","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel allocation","OFDM","Resource management","Frequency division multiplexing","Programmable control","Round robin","Power line communications","Downlink","Time division multiple access","Frequency division multiaccess"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","broadband networks","channel allocation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation algorithm","multiuser OFDM systems","resource allocation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","frequency selective channels","wideband applications","power line communications","wireless networks","fast execution time algorithms","time-varying behavior"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of efficient resource allocation for multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing over frequency selective channels.

spectrum sharing is a concept where unlicensed devices are allowed to opportunistically access unused spectrum bands. The goal of this paper is to develop and analyze a novel secondary user sensing strategy that on the average minimizes the need to take sensing measurements and therefore maximizes throughput. In particular, we focus on the IEEE 802.22 standard where the goal is to detect TV signals. A secondary or unlicensed user must continuously monitor the band it is using and relinquish it as soon as it detects a primary or licensed user. The secondary user has to minimize its probability of missed opportunity to transmit while adhering to the probability of detecting the primary user. In this paper, we have applied the methods of sequential detection to reduce the sensing time. A collaborative detection scheme with the energy detector at the secondary user running a sequential detection test is used. The central node runs a parallel sequential test. Performance gains have been quantified for hard and soft decision combining at the central node and compared with the IEEE 802.22 wireless regional area network standard. The proposed scheme delivers a 3-204 times increase in throughput for SNRs in the range -10 dB to 0 dB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9856519","htmlLink":"/document/4511042/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Sequential Detection In The Context Of Dynamic Spectrum Access For Cognitive Radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Sequential Detection In The Context Of Dynamic Spectrum Access For Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"ICECS-00-150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059952S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4456901","isNumber":"4510892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456901","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4510892","articleId":"4511042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4511046,"authors":[{"name":"S.

And we apply the SVD to each high-pass subband, and modify the singular values of the host image with the singular values of the 1-level DT-CWT-transformed watermark image. Insertion in all color components allows the development of a watermarking algorithm that is robust against some signal processing operations, such as Gaussian blur, Gaussian noise, pixelation, JPEG compression, scaling, contrast adjustment, histogram equalization, gamma correction, rotation and cropping.

As the modes with the punctured code need a higher decision depth than those with the rate \u00bd code, these modes cause a higher power consumption due to the greater area employed.

The VLSI implementation is sought to maximize the speed of a hybrid algorithm developed previously for the underwater active sonar echolocation system. It consists of two parts: discrete wavelet transform (DWT) filtering bank, and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) convolver. The DWT filtering bank is employed to minimize the unwanted sonar channel characteristics thus enhancing the signal received from the target. The output of the DWT denoising block is then processed by the CWT convolver in order to estimate target's motion parameters. Simulation results obtained have clearly demonstrated the capability of the VLSI architecture in providing the very efficient and accurate solution in sonar signal detection.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Sonar detection","Signal detection","Discrete wavelet transforms","Continuous wavelet transforms","Field programmable gate arrays","Channel bank filters","Filter bank","Filtering","Convolvers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","discrete wavelet transforms","field programmable gate arrays","signal denoising","signal detection","sonar signal processing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architecture","wavelet-based broadband sonar signal detection system","digital approximation","field-programmable gate array","discrete wavelet transform filtering bank","continuous wavelet transform convolver","sonar channel characteristics","DWT denoising block"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511061","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511061","startPage":"593","endPage":"596","publicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456901/4510892/04511061.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511061/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and Effective VLSI Architecture for a Wavelet-based Broadband Sonar Signal Detection System","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9856538","htmlLink":"/document/4511061/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and Effective VLSI Architecture for a Wavelet-based Broadband Sonar Signal Detection System","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"ICECS-00-169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034248S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4456901","isNumber":"4510892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456901","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4510892","articleId":"4511061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4511062,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando Azevedo","affiliation":["Dep.

The regulator does not require any on-chip compensation capacitors, and ensures stable operation for a very wide range of capacitive loads.

In the current analog IC fabrication technologies, IF filters are usually implemented as OTA-C filters. The design of OTA-C IF filters can be achieved by employing either the existing gradient-based optimization techniques or the conventional genetic algorithms (GAs). However, the latter approach may result in relatively slower convergence speeds. This paper presents a novel application of diversity controlled (DC) GAs to the rapid optimization of OTA-C IF filters. In this application, the gains associated with the constituent OTA transconductances are used as optimization parameters. DCGA is well known to exhibit an order of magnitude improvement in the convergence speed as compared to conventional GAs. The proposed approach is illustrated through its application to the optimization of an OTA-C IF filter consisting of 39 OTAs for operation around a center frequency of 455 kHz.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511137","publicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456901/4510892/04511137.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510892","startPage":"903","endPage":"906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Diversity Controlled Genetic Algorithms to the Design and Optimization of OTA-C IF Filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application of Diversity Controlled Genetic Algorithms to the Design and Optimization of OTA-C IF Filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511137/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9856614","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4511137/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Diversity Controlled Genetic Algorithms to the Design and Optimization of OTA-C IF Filters","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"ICECS-00-245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06232S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4456901","isNumber":"4510892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456901","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4510892","articleId":"4511137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4511139,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Mostardini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Mostardini","id":"37670589200"},{"name":"Luca Bacciarelli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Bacciarelli","id":"37644291500"},{"name":"Luca Fanucci","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Fanucci","id":"37265849900"},{"name":"Lorenzo Bertini","affiliation":["Sensor Dynamics AG, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Bertini","id":"37445296600"},{"name":"Marco Tonarelli","affiliation":["Sensor Dynamics AG, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Tonarelli","id":"37671469200"},{"name":"Adolfo Giambastiani","affiliation":["Sensor Dynamics AG, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Adolfo","lastName":"Giambastiani","id":"37397106300"},{"name":"Marco De Marinis","affiliation":["Sensor Dynamics AG, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"De Marinis","id":"37352244400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1377-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1378-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4511139","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit testing","Automatic testing","System testing","Digital circuits","Application specific integrated circuits","Costs","Very large scale integration","Production systems","Test pattern generators","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic testing","digital circuits","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","field programmable gate arrays","lowcost ATE test systems","automatic tests","digital circuits","VLSI circuits","HDL-simulation","ASIC prototypes","high-end test machine"]}],"abstract":"Digital circuits complexity and density are increasing while, at the same time, more quality and reliability are required.

In this paper a case study of low-cost, reconfigurable, versatile and easy-to-use FPGA-based test environment is presented. It allows patterns to be extracted from HDL-simulation and stimuli to be generated to ASIC prototypes, especially when a high-end test machine setup isn't foreseen or isn't available yet. This is the ideal solution for engineers to develop test programs and perform device tests and yield analysis on their desktop and then transfer the test program directly to production.

The promising experimental results validate the principle and open new perspectives in terms of ASIC integration of the whole system.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511147","publicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456901/4510892/04511147.pdf","startPage":"943","endPage":"946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510892","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECG Signal Artifacts Suppression System Based on an MRI Environment Dedicated CMOS Magnetic Field Monitor and FPGA Implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511147/","displayDocTitle":"ECG Signal Artifacts Suppression System Based on an MRI Environment Dedicated CMOS Magnetic Field Monitor and FPGA Implementation","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4511147/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9856624","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG Signal Artifacts Suppression System Based on an MRI Environment Dedicated CMOS Magnetic Field Monitor and FPGA Implementation","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"ICECS-00-255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03452S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4456901","isNumber":"4510892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456901","xplore-issue":"4510892","articleId":"4511147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4511150,"authors":[{"name":"Souha Masmoudi","affiliation":["Cit\u00e9 technologique des Communications, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Souha","lastName":"Masmoudi","id":"38098167000"},{"name":"Adel Ghazel","affiliation":["Cit\u00e9 technologique des Communications, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Adel","lastName":"Ghazel","id":"37283433500"},{"name":"Patrick Loumeau","affiliation":["Telecom, LTCI UMR 5141 CNRS, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Loumeau","id":"37265088100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1377-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1378-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4511150","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Energy consumption","Design optimization","Radio frequency","Analog-digital conversion","Analytical models","Circuit simulation","Performance analysis","Bit rate","Random sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","low-power electronics","personal area networks","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase data converter design","analog-to-digital converter","wireless receiver","IEEE 802.15.4 standard","ADC dynamic range","power consumption","phase resolution","WPAN"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes design and circuit implementation of phase analog-to-digital data converter for radio receiver compliant with IEEE 802.15.4 standard.

The number of bits can be extended by concatenating more stages together. For example, four 8 x8 bit units can be used to build a 16 x 16 bit Booth multiplier. In our proposed architecture, the multiplier adapts to different bit-lengths by using external control signals. The performance of our reconflgurable multiplier are compared with a parallel array multiplier and a conventional Booth multiplier. The comparison is based on synthesis results obtained by synthesizing all multiplier architectures targeting a Xilinx FPGA. The overhead resulting from our reconfiguration scheme are also evaluated and compared to a conventional Booth and array multipliers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456901/4510892/04511155.pdf","startPage":"975","endPage":"978","publicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510892","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A VLSI architecture for a Run-time Multi-precision Reconfigurable Booth Multiplier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Runtime","Signal processing algorithms","Energy consumption","Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Signal synthesis","Digital signal processing","Silicon","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","multiplying circuits","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architecture","run-time multi-precision reconfigurable booth multiplier","Radix-4","reconflgurable multiplier","Xilinx FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI architecture for a Run-time Multi-precision Reconfigurable Booth Multiplier","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4511155/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9856632","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI architecture for a Run-time Multi-precision Reconfigurable Booth Multiplier","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"ICECS-00-263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062481S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4456901","isNumber":"4510892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456901","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4510892","articleId":"4511155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4511158,"authors":[{"name":"F.J.

We report synthesis results showing a O(N log N) area complexity, where N represents the number of nodes, with a quasi-linear aggregate bandwidth growth. The slice utilization is less than 25% on a Xilinx VP100 for a 32 nodes version of the RoC, supporting an aggregate bandwidth of about 12 GB/s.

System- on-a-Programmable-Chip (SOPC) concept is bringing a major revolution in the design of integrated circuits due to the flexibility it provides and the complexity it caters to. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a powerful function optimizer that is successfully used to solve problems in numerous fields. The main downside of PSO is that it has significant computation time because of sequential execution of software implementations. In this paper, an SOPC-based PSO framework is proposed. By implementing a hardware/software co-design of PSO, most of the computations can simultaneously be performed using hardware to reduce the computation time, while keeping the flexibility of software.

The main interest is that in a context of embedded steady camera, such a system allows to focus on targets with high resolution while keeping background in low resolution. Drastic power consumption reduction is achieved by tremendously reducing the amount of processed data.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456901/4510892/04511167.pdf","startPage":"1023","endPage":"1026","publicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510892","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture for a low power image sensor with motion detection based ROI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sensors","Motion detection","Spatial resolution","Energy consumption","Computational Intelligence Society","Image resolution","Robustness","CMOS image sensors","Layout","Image converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power image sensor architecture","embedded systems","power consumption","CMOS image sensor","robust motion detection algorithms","embedded steady camera"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Architecture for a low power image sensor with motion detection based ROI","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4511167/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9856644","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture for a low power image sensor with motion detection based ROI","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"ICECS-00-275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083584S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4456901","isNumber":"4510892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456901","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4510892","articleId":"4511167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4511176,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

In order to get beyond this problem different revolutionary interconnect approaches have been explored. One of the most feasible approaches is RF/wireless interconnects, which are based on low-loss and dispersion-free microwave signal transmissions, near-field capacitive coupling and modern multiple-access technologies like code division multiple access (CDMA), frequency domain multiple access (FDMA), time domain multiple access (TDMA) etc. In this paper the prospects of multi-carrier CDMA interconnect approach has been investigated for inter- and intra-ULSI communications. Additionally, energy-efficient channel coding schemes for multi-carrier CDMA interconnect is demonstrated. It is observed that the introduction of channel coding scheme provides performance improvement as compared to uncoded multi-carrier CDMA-interconnect. These hybrid approaches have the potential to enable next- generation computing and processing systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456901/4510892/04511176.pdf","startPage":"1059","endPage":"1062","publicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510892","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Carrier CDMA-Interconnect for Inter- and Intra-ULSI Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit interconnections","Multiaccess communication","Microwave communication","Ultra large scale integration","Channel coding","Radio frequency","RF signals","Coupling circuits","Microwave technology","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","code division multiple access","integrated circuit interconnections","ULSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier CDMA interconnect","interULSI communications","intraULSI communications","ultra large-scale integrated circuits","code division multiple access","energy-efficient channel coding","next generation computing system","next generation processing systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Carrier CDMA-Interconnect for Inter- and Intra-ULSI Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4511176/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9856653","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Carrier CDMA-Interconnect for Inter- and Intra-ULSI Communications","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"ICECS-00-284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047295S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4456901","isNumber":"4510892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456901","xplore-issue":"4510892","articleId":"4511176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4511180,"authors":[{"name":"Ravinder S.

The most striking result is the possibility to perform separation from a smaller number of STSD matrices. We also discuss the possibility and the suitability of the STSD matrices to a joint diagonalisation criterion because of the different time-scale property assumption.

The results show that FPGA-based servers have a similar or superior throughput than other approaches but with reduced consumption of resources and low clock rates.","publicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456901/4510892/04511208.pdf","startPage":"1187","endPage":"1190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of FPGA-Embedded Web Servers","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4510892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511208","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511208/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of FPGA-Embedded Web Servers","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9856685","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4511208/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of FPGA-Embedded Web Servers","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"ICECS-00-316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045213S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4456901","isNumber":"4510892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456901","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4510892","articleId":"4511208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4511212,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A quasi-SRAM structure is combined with the slave latch of the proposed flip-flops. The already existing sleep signal of the MTCMOS circuitry is also used for controlling the data retention and restoration operations, thereby eliminating the need for any extra control signals with the new flip-flops.

A side-channel analysis (SCA) attack takes advantage of implementation specific characteristics to recover the secret parameters involved in the computation. The goals of side-channel attack countermeasures are reducing the correlation between the side-channel data and the secret data. Data masking is one of the most powerful countermeasure against side channel attacks. The message and the key are masked with some random values at the beginning of computations.

The metamaterials are usually realized by some periodic structures composed of a conductor and/or dielectric/magnetic materials. In order to design the characteristics of metamaterial properly, some theoretical and/or numerical techniques are required. The FDTD method is recognized as a powerful analyzing method for the metamaterials, because considerably, complicated phenomena can be analyzed easily. Furthermore, some techniques have been proposed to analyze the periodic structures using the FDTD method. One of which is the Spectral Domain FDTD method. This method has a very simple algorithm, and gives stable results, but this method can be applied only for a single frequency in general. The another one is called Field-Transformation (FT-FDTD)method proposed. This technique can be applied to a pulse response, but, requires some additional variables to realize a periodic boundary condition, The Mur's absorbing boundary condition is usually used in this method, for the simplicity. The application to the PML absorbing boundary is quite difficult because the more auxiliary variables are required. Furthermore, it has been found that some instability occurs when analyzing an oblique incident wave. In the first half, the spectral domain and FT-FDTD methods are briefly reviewed. In the second half, we analyze some periodic structures and we compare FT-FDTD method and spectral domain FDTD.","doi":"10.1109/IWAT.2008.4511317","publicationTitle":"2008 International Workshop on Antenna Technology: Small Antennas and Novel Metamaterials","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Workshop on Antenna Technology: Small Antennas and Novel Metamaterials","pdfPath":"/iel5/4497217/4511268/04511317.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAT.2008.4511317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4511268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of FT-FDTD and Spectral Domain FDTD for Periodic Structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 March 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511317/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of FT-FDTD and Spectral Domain FDTD for Periodic Structures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"10013529","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4511317/","conferenceDate":"4-6 March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of FT-FDTD and Spectral Domain FDTD for Periodic Structures","confLoc":"Chiba, Japan","sourcePdf":"IWAT-00-49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080177S","chronDate":"4-6 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4497217","isNumber":"4511268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4497217","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4511268","articleId":"4511317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4511325,"authors":[{"name":"Dirk Manteuffel","affiliation":["IMST GmbH, Kamp-Lintfort, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Manteuffel","id":"37277936100"},{"name":"Matthias Arnold","affiliation":["IMST GmbH, Kamp-Lintfort, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Arnold","id":"37305650700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1522-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4511325","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"abstract":"Tomorrows mobile terminals shall be multi-standard platforms for various kinds of wireless applications. So far, nowadays mobiles consist of a combination of different separated modules e.g. for GSM, for Bluetooth, WLAN, etc.. Along with these different modules typically separated antennas are use, such as one for GSM/UMTS and another one for Bluetooth and yet another one for FM radio. Currently the design is heading towards multi-standard RF modules that combine several standards or operate on the principle of a software defined radio. Hence, an ubiquitous antenna module that can be attached to such a multi-standard module is required. However, different to the software algorithms and the integrated circuitries, an antenna is still bound to its physical size in terms of wavelength in order to operate efficiently. As the operating frequency of the applications under discussion range from approx. 100 MHz to 2.5 GHz standard antenna concepts for mobile terminals cannot be use because of the large bandwidth and the physical antenna size at low frequencies. The research presented in this paper intends to analyze basic requirements for such an antenna module to operate sufficiently and to propose an applicable concept under the typical constraints of consumer electronic applications and mass production issues.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Workshop on Antenna Technology: Small Antennas and Novel Metamaterials","pdfPath":"/iel5/4497217/4511268/04511325.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"234","publicationTitle":"2008 International Workshop on Antenna Technology: Small Antennas and Novel Metamaterials","doi":"10.1109/IWAT.2008.4511325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAT.2008.4511325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4511268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Considerations for Reconfigurable Multi-Standard Antennas for Mobile Terminals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile antennas","GSM","Bluetooth","Wireless LAN","3G mobile communication","Radio frequency","Software standards","Software radio","Software algorithms","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","software radio","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable multistandard antennas","mobile terminals","multistandard RF modules","software defined radio","ubiquitous antenna module","consumer electronic","mass production"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511325/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Considerations for Reconfigurable Multi-Standard Antennas for Mobile Terminals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4511325/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"10013539","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","conferenceDate":"4-6 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Considerations for Reconfigurable Multi-Standard Antennas for Mobile Terminals","confLoc":"Chiba, Japan","sourcePdf":"IWAT-00-57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040689S","chronDate":"4-6 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4497217","isNumber":"4511268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4497217","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4511268","articleId":"4511325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4511338,"authors":[{"name":"Katsunori Ishimiya","affiliation":["Department of International Development Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan","Sony Ericsson Research Center, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Katsunori","lastName":"Ishimiya","id":"37319040700"},{"name":"Jonas Langbacka","affiliation":["Sony Ericsson Research Center, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"Langbacka","id":"38243072100"},{"name":"Zhinong Ying","affiliation":["Sony Ericsson Research Center, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Zhinong","lastName":"Ying","id":"37305489700"},{"name":"Jun-ichi Takada","affiliation":["Department of International Development Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun-ichi","lastName":"Takada","id":"37269840500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1522-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4511338","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":816},"abstract":"Multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) is an antenna technology for wireless communications in which multiple antennas are used at both the source (transmitter) and the destination (receiver). The antennas at each end of the communications circuit are combined to minimize the errors and to optimize the data speed. MIMO-based antennas are of interest in relation to communication such as digital TV, wireless LAN and mobile communications. MIMO arrangements are of particular interest for other communication devices. When applying a dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) type in a MIMO system and using it for the transmission of two or more signals using the same frequency, high coupling often occurs between the different antenna signals. The occurrence of the coupling may seriously degrade the performance of such an antenna. Thus, it would be beneficial to provide a DRA that can be used to simultaneously transmit and receive more than one signal at the same frequency. Also, where the incidence of coupling between these antennas, signals is reduced. DAR offers several advantages such as wide bandwidth, small size, ease of fabrication and high radiation efficiency. This paper presents characteristics of DRA antenna for 2.6 GHz (UMTS band 7).","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Workshop on Antenna Technology: Small Antennas and Novel Metamaterials","pdfPath":"/iel5/4497217/4511268/04511338.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"289","publicationTitle":"2008 International Workshop on Antenna Technology: Small Antennas and Novel Metamaterials","doi":"10.1109/IWAT.2008.4511338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAT.2008.4511338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4511268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compact MIMO DRA Antenna","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Dielectric resonator antennas","Transmitting antennas","Mobile communication","Receiving antennas","Frequency","Couplings","Communications technology","Wireless communication","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","dielectric resonator antennas","electromagnetic coupling","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO DRA antenna","multiple input multiple output antenna","wireless communications","multiple antennas","dielectric resonator antenna","coupling","frequency 2.6 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Compact MIMO DRA Antenna","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4511338/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"10013553","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","conferenceDate":"4-6 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compact MIMO DRA Antenna","confLoc":"Chiba, Japan","sourcePdf":"IWAT-00-70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047543S","chronDate":"4-6 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4497217","isNumber":"4511268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4497217","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4511268","articleId":"4511338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4511359,"authors":[{"name":"Tsui-Tsai Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National United University, Miaoli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsui-Tsai","lastName":"Lin","id":"37291209500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1522-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4511359","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"abstract":"In this paper, a low-complexity two-stage decision-directed receiver is proposed for a code- division multiple access (CDMA) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system using space-time block coding (STBC) over a multipath fading channel.

In this paper, the forementioned analysis is carried out for continuous wavelet transform. The analysis of the scalogram as the instantaneous frequency estimator is performed for any FM signal regardless of the mother wavelet. Accurate expressions for the bias and the variance of the estimator are derived, and reveal that the bias and the variance are signal dependent. Results are statistically confirmed through the numerical analysis for several mother wavelets, and among considered wavelets, the Morlet wavelet produces the smallest estimation error. Furthermore, the performance of the IF estimator based on the scalogram and the spectrogram were compared through analysis of mean square error. These results showed that the scalogram with the Morlet wavelet exhibited good performance for the sample linear FM signal and the sample hyperbolic FM signal in comparison to the spectrogram.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.924856","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4567637/04511413.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.924856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567637","startPage":"3837","endPage":"3845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative Performance Analysis of Scalogram as Instantaneous Frequency Estimator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative Performance Analysis of Scalogram as Instantaneous Frequency Estimator","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10115197","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4511413/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative Performance Analysis of Scalogram as Instantaneous Frequency Estimator","sourcePdf":"56tsp08-sejdic-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122698S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4567637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4567637","articleId":"4511413","onlineDate":"07 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4511436,"authors":[{"name":"Manolis Terrovitis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Manolis","lastName":"Terrovitis","id":"37276649900"},{"name":"Nikos Mamoulis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Nikos","lastName":"Mamoulis","id":"37276738200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3154-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-6245"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0324"}],"articleNumber":"4511436","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":150,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":889},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Transaction databases","Data privacy","Mobile computing","Conference management","Radiofrequency identification","Bioreactors","Computer science","Protection","Diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","security of data","social aspects of automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy preservation","trajectory publication","privacy protection","location sequence publication","trajectory database","RFID debit card","partial trajectory knowledge","quasi-identifier","data suppression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["privacy","trajectories","spatiotemporal","spatial l-diversity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511436","abstract":"We study the problem of protecting privacy in the publication of location sequences.

Random outages of generating units and transmission lines as well as load forecasting inaccuracy are modeled as scenario trees in the Monte Carlo simulation. Unlike previous reliability analyses methods in the literature which considered the solution of an economic dispatch problem, this model solves an hourly unit commitment problem, which incorporates spatial constraints of generating units and transmission lines, random component outages, and load forecast uncertainty into the reliability problem. The classical methods considered predefined reserve constraints in the deterministic solution of unit commitment. However, this study considers possible uncertainties when calculating the optimal reserve in the unit commitment solution as a tradeoff between minimizing operating costs and satisfying power system reliability requirements. Loss-of-load-expectation (LOLE) is included as a constraint in the stochastic unit commitment for calculating the cost of supplying the reserve. The proposed model can be used by a vertically integrated utility or an ISO. In the first case, the utility considers the impact of long-term fuel and emission scheduling on power system reliability studies. In the second case, fuel and emission constraints of individual generating companies are submitted as energy constraints when solving the ISO's reliability problem. Numerical simulations indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for minimizing the cost of reliability in stochastic power systems.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.922231","startPage":"1364","endPage":"1374","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2008.922231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578730","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4578730/04511485.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost of Reliability Analysis Based on Stochastic Unit Commitment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511485/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cost of Reliability Analysis Based on Stochastic Unit Commitment","volume":"23","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4511485/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10117938","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost of Reliability Analysis Based on Stochastic Unit Commitment","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs03-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092598S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4578730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"4578730","articleId":"4511485","onlineDate":"07 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4511492,"authors":[{"name":"Jungho Kim","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Festk\u00f6rperphysik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3/4533030/4511492/4511492-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jungho Kim (M'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, in 2006.

These challenges include reduced accuracy due to multipath interference, sampling rate limitations, tag synchronization, and antenna phase-center variation. Each of these factors must be addressed to achieve millimeter or sub-millimeter accuracy. The developed system architecture is presented where a 300-ps Gaussian pulse modulates an 8-GHz carrier signal and is transmitted through an omni-directional UWB antenna. Receiver-side peak detection, a low-cost subsequential-sampling mixer utilizing a direct digital synthesizer, high fidelity 10-MHz crystals, and Vivaldi phase-center calibration are utilized to mitigate these challenging problems. Synchronized and unsynchronized experimental results validated with a sub-millimeter accurate optical tracking system are presented with a detailed discussion of various system errors.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2008.923351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4539055","startPage":"1316","endPage":"1330","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4539055/04511506.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of High-Accuracy Indoor 3-D Positioning Using UWB Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4511506/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Investigation of High-Accuracy Indoor 3-D Positioning Using UWB Technology","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10074594","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of High-Accuracy Indoor 3-D Positioning Using UWB Technology","sourcePdf":"56tmtt06-mahfouz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145797S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4539055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"4539055","articleId":"4511506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":4511510,"authors":[{"name":"Lorene Samoska","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4539055/4511510/4511510-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lorene Samoska (M'95\u2013SM'04) received the B.S. degree in engineering physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in 1989, and the Ph.D. degree in materials engineering from the University of California at Santa Barbara, in 1995.","She was a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the University of California at Santa Barbara, where she was involved with the design and fabrication of state-of-the-art InP HBT microwave digital circuits.

We designed the module for a targeted frequency range of 300-350 GHz, using WR2.2 for the input and output waveguides. The waveguide module utilizes radial -plane transitions from S-MMIC to waveguide. We designed back-to-back radial probe transitions separated by thru transmission lines to characterize the module, and have incorporated the radial -plane transitions with an S-MMIC amplifier, fabricated monolithically as a single chip. The chip makes use of an S-MMIC process and amplifier design from the Northrop Grumman Corporation, Redondo Beach, CA, using 35-nm gate-length InP transistors. The integrated module design eliminates the need for wire bonds in the RF signal path, and enables a drop-in approach for minimal assembly. The waveguide module includes a channel design, which optimizes the -plane probe bandwidth to compensate for an S-MMIC width, which is larger than the waveguide dimension, and is compatible with S-MMIC fabrication and design rules. This paper demonstrates for the first time that waveguide-based S-MMIC amplifier modules with integrated waveguide transitions can be successfully operated at submillimeter-wave frequencies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Submillimeter-Wave HEMT Amplifier Module With Integrated Waveguide Transitions Operating Above 300 GHz","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2008.923353","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4539055/04511510.pdf","startPage":"1380","endPage":"1388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2008.923353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4539055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511510/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Submillimeter-Wave HEMT Amplifier Module With Integrated Waveguide Transitions Operating Above 300 GHz","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4511510/","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10074598","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Submillimeter-Wave HEMT Amplifier Module With Integrated Waveguide Transitions Operating Above 300 GHz","sourcePdf":"56tmtt06-samoska.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093246S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4539055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4539055","articleId":"4511510","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4511511,"authors":[{"name":"Isao Takenaka","affiliation":["NEC Electronics Corporation Limited, Otsu, Shiga, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4539055/4511511/4511511-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Isao Takenaka (M'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in physical engineering from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 1991 and 1993, respectively.","In 1993, he joined the NEC Corporation.

By using this tool, we get rid of numerous and complex operation and do not have to use external tools for finding parameters as need by using other algorithms such as the genetic algorithm.

Squier, the inventor of the Muzak system, was the inventor as well, in 1910, of telephone carrier multiplexing, the forerunner of microwave frequency multiplexing after World War II, and its current incarnation as optical wavelength multiplexing. Squier was a Major in the United States Army Signal Corps at the time, later becoming Major General and Chief Signal Officer. His invention was initially rejected by AT&T engineers as not being commercially viable. This view was not shared by others in the engineering community, including John Stone Stone, a distinguished independent telephone engineer. After prodding by Stone, AT&T officials began a reappraisal of the \"wired wireless\" system, as Squier chose to call it, and by 1914 development of a commercial system, was underway. By 1918, however, when the AT&T system went into service, AT&T was claiming that Squier's work had only been \"suggestive\" and that its system was based on inventions of its own engineers. We describe the sequence of events, beginning with Squier's invention, that led to the AT&T commercial rollout of carrier multiplexing. We also offer some possible reasons, based on archival documents, as to why AT&T downplayed Squier's invention.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4511634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2008.4511639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/4511634/04511639.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"24","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2008.4511639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The origins of carrier multiplexing: Major George Owen Squier and AT&T","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"The origins of carrier multiplexing: Major George Owen Squier and AT&T","volume":"46","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4511639/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9998061","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The origins of carrier multiplexing: Major George Owen Squier and AT&T","sourcePdf":"05cihistory.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023804S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4511634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4511634","articleId":"4511639","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4511651,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengyuan Xu","affiliation":["University of California, Riverside, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Zhengyuan Xu [5'97, M'99, SM'02] (dxu@ee.ucr.edu) is an associate professor with tenure in electrical engineering at the University of California, Riverside.

In the presence of intra-die process variations, this locus is determined by the delay/leakage parameters of each baseband module. In our approach, a path oscillation test applied to each module is used to select the \"best\" locus of choice and an EVM driven feedback loop is used to dynamically modulate the wordlength/power consumption of each module as dictated by this locus to minimize power and modulate baseband SNR across a range of channel conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test Enabled Process Tuning for Adaptive Baseband OFDM Processor","publicationTitle":"26th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (vts 2008)","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2008.38","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (vts 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4511672/4511673/04511689.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2008.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4511673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 27 2008-May 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"Test Enabled Process Tuning for Adaptive Baseband OFDM Processor","conferenceDate":"27 April-1 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4511689/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9964415","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test Enabled Process Tuning for Adaptive Baseband OFDM Processor","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3123a009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072166S","chronDate":"April 27 2008-May 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4511672","isNumber":"4511673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4511672","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4511673","articleId":"4511689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4511697,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoliang Pan","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Zhaoliang","lastName":"Pan","id":"37291672900"},{"name":"Melvin A.

Due to high defect rates, process variations and quantum effects, manufacturing yields have decreased. To increase the effective yield, error-tolerance, which allows for some defective chips to be employed in systems that can tolerate errors, has been proposed. To support error-tolerance, the acceptability of defective chips must be quantified according to certain measures. A new measure is proposed in this paper, namely significance-based error-rate (SBER). SBER combines two previously studied error-tolerance measures, namely error-significance and error-rate. In this paper we introduce three different ways to quantify the SBER value(s) of a defective chip using built-in self-test (BIST). These techniques cover the following scenarios: (1) multiple copies of a target circuit where at least one copy is non-defective; (2) multiple copies of a target circuit where none are defect free; and (3) single copy of a defective target circuit. For each scenario, the statistical characteristics of the estimation of the SBER value are discussed.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511697","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor device measurement","Discrete cosine transforms","Testing","Built-in self-test","Frequency","Application specific integrated circuits","Image coding","Very large scale integration","CMOS technology","Manufacturing processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","CMOS integrated circuits","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["basing acceptable error-tolerant performance","significance-based error-rate (SBER)","CMOS scaling","quantum effects","error-tolerance","built-in self-test","defective target circuit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["error-tolerance","error-rate","error-significance","SBER"]}],"publicationTitle":"26th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (vts 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (vts 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4511672/4511673/04511697.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4511673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2008.51","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2008.51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Basing Acceptable Error-Tolerant Performance on Significance-Based Error-rate (SBER)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 27 2008-May 1 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511697/","displayDocTitle":"Basing Acceptable Error-Tolerant Performance on Significance-Based Error-rate (SBER)","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27 April-1 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9964422","htmlLink":"/document/4511697/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Basing Acceptable Error-Tolerant Performance on Significance-Based Error-rate (SBER)","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3123a059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098741S","chronDate":"April 27 2008-May 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4511672","isNumber":"4511673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4511672","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4511673","articleId":"4511697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4511702,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It provides information about the location of manufacturing defects in the memory, and its effectiveness allows a fast yield ramp up. Most of existing diagnosis methods uses a fault dictionary to provide detailed information on fault localization. However, these solutions are most of the time unable to distinguish between all faults, and more importantly often fail to identify the actual faulty block of the memory. Identifying which block of a memory (core- cell array, write drivers, address decoders, pre-charge circuits, etc ...) is defective allows to saving considerable amount of time during the ramp up phase. In this paper, we propose a very low cost design-for- diagnosis (DfD) solution for identifying faulty write drivers. It consists in verifying logic and analog conditions that guarantee the fault-free behavior of the write driver. The proposed solution allows a fast diagnosis (only three consecutive write operations are needed to fully diagnose the write driver) and induces a low area overhead (about 0.5% for a 512 times 512 SRAM). Beside diagnosis, an additional interest of such a solution is its usefulness during a post-silicon characterization process, where it can be used to extract the main features of the write drivers (logic and analog levels on bit lines).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An SRAM Design-for-Diagnosis Solution Based on Write Driver Voltage Sensing","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2008.17","startPage":"89","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2008.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4511673","publicationTitle":"26th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (vts 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (vts 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4511672/4511673/04511702.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 27 2008-May 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"An SRAM Design-for-Diagnosis Solution Based on Write Driver Voltage Sensing","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4511702/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9964426","conferenceDate":"27 April-1 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An SRAM Design-for-Diagnosis Solution Based on Write Driver Voltage Sensing","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3123a089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059128S","chronDate":"April 27 2008-May 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4511672","isNumber":"4511673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4511672","xplore-issue":"4511673","articleId":"4511702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4511704,"authors":[{"name":"Niladri Narayan Mojumder","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Niladri Narayan","lastName":"Mojumder","id":"37541966300"},{"name":"Saibal Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Saibal","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37278557500"},{"name":"Jae-Joon Kim","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

Computer simulations based on 45nm PD/SOI technology demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the scheme in SRAM yield enhancement.","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2008.26","publicationTitle":"26th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (vts 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (vts 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4511672/4511673/04511704.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2008.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4511673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of a Self-Repairing SRAM with On-Chip Monitor and Compensation Circuitry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 27 2008-May 1 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511704/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of a Self-Repairing SRAM with On-Chip Monitor and Compensation Circuitry","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4511704/","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","conferenceDate":"27 April-1 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9964428","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of a Self-Repairing SRAM with On-Chip Monitor and Compensation Circuitry","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3123a101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064632S","chronDate":"April 27 2008-May 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4511672","isNumber":"4511673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4511672","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4511673","articleId":"4511704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4511707,"authors":[{"name":"Tze Wee Chen","affiliation":["Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tze Wee","lastName":"Chen","id":"37290414300"},{"name":"Kyunglok Kim","affiliation":["Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kyunglok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37656493400"},{"name":"Young Moon Kim","affiliation":["Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Young Moon","lastName":"Kim","id":"38185535300"},{"name":"Subhasish Mitra","affiliation":["Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Subhasish","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37276204700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3123-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3123-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"}],"articleNumber":"4511707","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":351},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ground penetrating radar","Geophysical measurement techniques","Delay","Circuit testing","Circuit simulation","Degradation","Digital circuits","Costs","Very large scale integration","Life testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit reliability","semiconductor device models","semiconductor device reliability","transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gate-oxide","early life failure prediction","device modeling","circuit simulations","gradually degraded drive currents","digital circuit paths","ELF candidate transistor","delay shifts","CMOS reliability"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gate-Oxide Early Life Failure Prediction","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2008.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4511673","endPage":"118","publicationTitle":"26th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (vts 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (vts 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4511672/4511673/04511707.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2008.55","startPage":"111","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511707","abstract":"This paper uses 90nm transistor-level experimental data, device modeling, and circuit simulations to establish the following results: 1. A transistor with defective gate- oxide, i.e., a gate-oxide early-life failure (ELF) candidate transistor, produces gradually degraded drive currents over time before it completely loses its transistor characteristics; 2. The above phenomenon results in gradual increase in delays of digital circuit paths containing the ELF candidate transistor before the circuit produces functional failures; 3. Gradual delay shifts caused by ELF candidate transistors are large enough to be detected using inexpensive digital techniques. These results can be utilized to overcome scaled-CMOS reliability challenges through ELF identification during production test or on-line during system operation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511707/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 27 2008-May 1 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9964429","htmlLink":"/document/4511707/","conferenceDate":"27 April-1 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Gate-Oxide Early Life Failure Prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gate-Oxide Early Life Failure Prediction","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3123a111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114279S","chronDate":"April 27 2008-May 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4511672","isNumber":"4511673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4511672","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4511673","articleId":"4511707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4511710,"authors":[{"name":"Anshuman Chandra","affiliation":["Synopsys, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anshuman","lastName":"Chandra","id":"37273911300"},{"name":"Rohit Kapur","affiliation":["Synopsys, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rohit","lastName":"Kapur","id":"37336169800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3123-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3123-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"}],"articleNumber":"4511710","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":249},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power dissipation","Circuit testing","Automatic test pattern generation","Switching circuits","Design for testability","Very large scale integration","Statistical analysis","Filling","Test pattern generators","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit testing","statistical analysis","switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bounded adjacent fill","low capture power scan testing","peak power dissipation","switching activity","statistical analysis","industrial circuits","circuit-under-test"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["low power","test","capture power","scan","random fill","shift power"]}],"abstract":"Average and peak power dissipation can be reduced by controlling the switching activity in the scan chains during shift and capture cycles. In particular, minimum transition count or adjacent fill algorithm reduces transitions in the scan chains and has been shown to reduce average power dissipation during shift. In this paper, we show via statistical analysis of industrial circuits that contrary to conventional belief, scan-in and scan-out vectors are highly correlated for adjacent fill vectors. We also show that this correlation can be used to control the switching activity during the capture cycle. We propose a new filling algorithm called bounded adjacent fill that generates test vectors with low shift and capture switching activity and with no impact on pattern count.","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2008.47","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (vts 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4511672/4511673/04511710.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4511673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2008.47","publicationTitle":"26th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (vts 2008)","startPage":"131","endPage":"138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounded Adjacent Fill for Low Capture Power Scan Testing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 27 2008-May 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"Bounded Adjacent Fill for Low Capture Power Scan Testing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511710/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4511710/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9964432","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","conferenceDate":"27 April-1 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounded Adjacent Fill for Low Capture Power Scan Testing","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3123a131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04454S","chronDate":"April 27 2008-May 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4511672","isNumber":"4511673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4511672","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4511673","articleId":"4511710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4511718,"authors":[{"name":"Rajarajan Senguttuvan","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Rajarajan","lastName":"Senguttuvan","id":"37408292800"},{"name":"Soumendu Bhattacharya","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Soumendu","lastName":"Bhattacharya","id":"37275361600"},{"name":"Abhijit Chatterjee","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Abhijit","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37273696200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3123-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3123-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"}],"articleNumber":"4511718","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Transceivers","Production","Digital modulation","Noise measurement","OFDM modulation","Frequency measurement","Particle measurements","Test equipment","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","testing","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier transceiver specifications","error-vector-magnitude","EVM","test equipment","digital modulation","test measurement","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["manufacturing testing","test time","communication systems"]}],"abstract":"Production testing of digitally modulated transceivers such as those based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has become challenging, particularly in the context of measuring specifications such as error-vector-magnitude (EVM) which require the use of precision test equipment with digital modulation capability and low noise floor. Moreover, test time is an issue due to the need to transmit and receive a large number of data bits for accurate test measurement. In this paper, a multi-tone based test method is presented for accurately measuring the EVM and noise specifications of a wireless device.

It is shown that this results in increased transmit signal dynamic range over existing techniques and accurate loopback testing of the transceiver modules.","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2008.58","publicationTitle":"26th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (vts 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (vts 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4511672/4511673/04511725.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2008.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4511673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ACT: Adaptive Calibration Test for Performance Enhancement and Increased Testability of Wireless RF Front-Ends","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 27 2008-May 1 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511725/","displayDocTitle":"ACT: Adaptive Calibration Test for Performance Enhancement and Increased Testability of Wireless RF Front-Ends","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9964443","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4511725/","conferenceDate":"27 April-1 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ACT: Adaptive Calibration Test for Performance Enhancement and Increased Testability of Wireless RF Front-Ends","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3123a215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050109S","chronDate":"April 27 2008-May 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4511672","isNumber":"4511673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4511672","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4511673","articleId":"4511725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4511753,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Nicolaidis","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory (CNRS, INPG,  UJF), France"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Nicolaidis","id":"37332469200"},{"name":"Renaud Perez","affiliation":["IRoC Technologies"],"firstName":"Renaud","lastName":"Perez","id":"38078332500"},{"name":"Dan Alexandrescu","affiliation":["IRoC Technologies"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Alexandrescu","id":"37543120000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3123-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3123-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"}],"articleNumber":"4511753","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":537},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Protection","Single event transient","Flip-flops","CMOS technology","Costs","Capacitance","CMOS logic circuits","Logic testing","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiation hardening (electronics)","semiconductor storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["highly-robust hardened cells","blocking feedback transistors","soft error rate","hardened storage cells","single event upsets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["soft errors","SEUs","radiation hardened cells"]}],"abstract":"CMOS nanometric technologies are increasingly sensitive to soft errors, including SEUs affecting storage cells and SETs initiated in the combinational logic, and eventually captured by some latches or flip- flops.

SMC can be used to solve some problems associated with nonlinear non-Gaussian probability distribution. Sampling is a key step for these methods and has vital effects on simulation results. Various sampling strategies have been proposed to improve the simulation results of SMC methods, but degeneracy of particles sometimes is very severe so that there are only a few particles having significant weights. Diversity of particle samples is reduced significantly so that only a few particles are used to represent the corresponding probability distribution. This kind of sampling is not reasonable to approximate probability distribution. This paper addresses a new method which can avoid the phenomenon of particle degeneracy. We split particles with very big weights into two small ones and use the strategy of neural network to adjust positions of tail particles in order to increase their weights. Another advantage is that this method can efficiently make simulation results approach the actual object. Our simulation results of the typical tracking problem show that not only the phenomenon of particle degeneracy is effectively avoided but also tracking results are much better than those of the traditional particle filters. Compared with the move-resample method, our method shows better results under the same conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.924894","startPage":"3421","endPage":"3429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.924894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4694051","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4694051/04511765.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Monte Carlo Particle Model Associated with Neural Networks for Tracking Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511765/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Monte Carlo Particle Model Associated with Neural Networks for Tracking Problem","volume":"55","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4511765/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10360430","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Monte Carlo Particle Model Associated with Neural Networks for Tracking Problem","sourcePdf":"55tcsi11-pang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122899S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4694051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4694051","articleId":"4511765","onlineDate":"07 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4511766,"authors":[{"name":"Dionysios Reisis","affiliation":["Electronics Laboratory, Department of Physics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4694051/4511766/4511766-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dionysios Reisis received the Ptychion degree in electrical engineering from the University of Patras, Patras, Greece, in 1983 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, in 1989 with the Ph.D. thesis \u201cParallel Algorithms on Mesh Connected Computer with Static and Reconfigurable Buses.\u201d This research involved parallel mesh computers and algorithms for signal, image, and graph processing, and vision and VLSI architectures.","In 1990, he started cooperation with the Telecommunications Laboratory, Division of Computer Science, National and Technical University of Athents (NTUA), as a Research Associate.

However, efficiently finding its second minimum value, min_2nd, requires the derivations of min_1st and finding the minimum value from the set of the remaining numbers. Efficient algorithms and cost-effective hardware of finding the two smallest of X are greatly needed for the low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoder design. The following two architectures are developed in this paper: (1) sorting-based (XS) approach and (2) tree structure (TS) approach. Experimental results show that the XS approach provides less number of comparisons, while the TS approach achieves higher speed performance at lower hardware cost. Since the hardware unit is repeatedly used in the LDPC decoder design, the proposed high-speed low-cost TS approach is strongly recommended.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.924892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.924892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4694051/04511767.pdf","startPage":"3430","endPage":"3437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4694051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithms of Finding the First Two Minimum Values and Their Hardware Implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Algorithms of Finding the First Two Minimum Values and Their Hardware Implementation","volume":"55","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10360429","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4511767/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithms of Finding the First Two Minimum Values and Their Hardware Implementation","sourcePdf":"55tcsi11-wey.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055759S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4694051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4694051","articleId":"4511767","onlineDate":"07 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4511816,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The aim of this to discriminate between between the groups of terminating (T registers) and non-terminating (N registers) of PAF episodes by using the ECG. A new technique, called wavelet sample entropy (WSE) is proposed. WSE exploits the combination of wavelet transform properties with regularity measure indexes, as sample entropy (SampEn). Results indicae that terminating episodes present lower mean values of SampEn than the non-terminating episodes. These results are consistent with the fact that fibrillatory activity become slower and more organized prior to termination. Both PAF groups were statistically distinguishable, given that the statistic significance obtained by the t-student test equals to 0.001 and 90% of test signals are correctly classified. This new method could improve the efficiency of traditional discrimination techniques, based on time or frequency analysis, and it could be helpful for a better understanding of atrial fibrillation mechanisms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Atrial fibrillation","Electrocardiography","Wavelet transforms","Testing","Wavelet analysis","Technological innovation","Biomedical engineering","Medical treatment","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","entropy","time-frequency analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECG","wavelet sample entropy","wavelet transform","atrial fibrillation","time-frequency analysis"]}],"publicationTitle":"2006 Computers in Cardiology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Computers in Cardiology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4511769/4511770/04511922.pdf","startPage":"597","endPage":"600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4511770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet sample entropy: A new approach to predict termination of atrial fibrillation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet sample entropy: A new approach to predict termination of atrial fibrillation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4511922/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sep. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4511922/","accessionNumber":"10024596","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet sample entropy: A new approach to predict termination of atrial fibrillation","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-05022008-00152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060873S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4511769","isNumber":"4511770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4511769","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4511770","articleId":"4511922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Computers in Cardiology","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4512014,"authors":[{"name":"Chengjun Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/4522567/4512014/4512014-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chengjun Liu received the Ph.D. degree from George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, in 1999.","Currently, he is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark.

The new color spaces are derived from the RGB color space that defines the tristimuli R, G, and B component images. While the UCS decorrelates its three component images using principal component analysis (PCA), the ICS derives three independent component images by means of blind source separation, such as independent component analysis (ICA). The DCS, which applies discriminant analysis, defines three new component images that are effective for face recognition. Effective color image representation is formed in these color spaces by concatenating their component images, and efficient color image classification is achieved using the effective color image representation and an enhanced Fisher model (EFM). Experiments on the face recognition grand challenge (FRGC) and the biometric experimentation environment (BEE) show that for the most challenging FRGC version 2 Experiment 4, which contains 12 776 training images, 16 028 controlled target images, and 8014 uncontrolled query images, the ICS, DCS, and UCS achieve the face verification rate (ROC III) of 73.69%, 71.42%, and 69.92%, respectively, at the false accept rate of 0.1%, compared to the RGB color space, the 2-D Karhunen-Loeve (KL) color space, and the FRGC baseline algorithm with the face verification rate of 67.13%, 59.16%, and 11.86%, respectively, with the same false accept rate.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2008.923824","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/4522567/04512014.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2008.923824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4522567","startPage":"213","endPage":"222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning the Uncorrelated, Independent, and Discriminating Color Spaces for Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4512014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning the Uncorrelated, Independent, and Discriminating Color Spaces for Face Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4512014/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10076263","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4512014/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning the Uncorrelated, Independent, and Discriminating Color Spaces for Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"03tifs02-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098949S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"4522567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4522567","articleId":"4512014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4512016,"authors":[{"name":"Jesus Garcia Herrero","affiliation":["Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Madrid, ES"],"firstName":"Jesus Garcia","lastName":"Herrero","id":"37298449900"},{"name":"Antonio Berlanga","affiliation":["Departamento de Inform\u00e1tica, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Colmenarejo, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Berlanga","id":"37273052800"},{"name":"Jose Manuel Molina Lopez","affiliation":["Departamento de Inform\u00e1tica, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Colmenarejo, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose Manuel Molina","lastName":"Lopez","id":"37265649000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4512016","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":437},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Air traffic control","Filters","Design engineering","Design optimization","Delta modulation","Proposals","Uncertainty","Pareto analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air traffic control","evolutionary computation","nonlinear filters","tracking filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary algorithm","air traffic control tracking filter","optimization technique","nonlinear tracking filter","fitness function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evolution strategies","multicriteria design","multiobjective optimization","multiply-specified tracking filters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4512016","abstract":"This paper addresses a real-world engineering design requiring the application of effective and global optimization techniques.

The model's passivity properties are usually assessed by computing the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian matrix, which is derived from the model parameters. The purely imaginary eigenvalues represent crossover frequencies where the model's conductance matrix is singular, allowing to pinpoint frequency intervals of passivity violations. Unfortunately, the eigenvalue computation time can be excessive for large models. Also, the test applies only to symmetrical models, and the testing is made difficult by numerical noise in the extracted eigenvalues. In this paper a new (non-Hamiltonian) half-size singularity test matrix is derived for use with admittance parameter state-space models, which overcomes these shortcomings. It gives a computational speedup by a factor of eight; it is applicable to both symmetric and unsymmetrical models; and it produces noiseless eigenvalues for reliable passivity assessment.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2008.923406","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4729794/04512041.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2008.923406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4729794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Half-Size Singularity Test Matrix for Fast and Reliable Passivity Assessment of Rational Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4512041","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4512041/","displayDocTitle":"A Half-Size Singularity Test Matrix for Fast and Reliable Passivity Assessment of Rational Models","volume":"24","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370555","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4512041/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Half-Size Singularity Test Matrix for Fast and Reliable Passivity Assessment of Rational Models","sourcePdf":"24tpwrd01-semlyen-923406.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055178S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4729794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"4729794","articleId":"4512041","onlineDate":"07 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4512049,"authors":[{"name":"Scott L.

To minimize the number of probe pads and maximize area utilization efficiency, a memory-addressing design scheme is implemented to select the device-under-test within the test chip. By adjusting channel width of transmission gates at the design stage, the input resistance of FC-TSA bit-cell can be parameterized and configured to satisfy the series resistance requirement of various test structures; moreover, the leakage current can be minimized with such a methodology to meet a 1-nA design specification. A 40 x 20 FC-TSA has been implemented by utilizing a state-of-the-art logic process to demonstrate design feasibility. The measurements of a set of transistor and process monitor test structures are reviewed and corresponding models discussed.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2008.2000278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4512051","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/66/4512051/04512059.pdf","endPage":"179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field-Configurable Test Structure Array (FC-TSA): Enabling Design for Monitor, Model, and Manufacturability","doi":"10.1109/TSM.2008.2000278","startPage":"169","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4512059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Field-Configurable Test Structure Array (FC-TSA): Enabling Design for Monitor, Model, and Manufacturability","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4512059/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10140621","publicationDate":"May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4512059/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field-Configurable Test Structure Array (FC-TSA): Enabling Design for Monitor, Model, and Manufacturability","sourcePdf":"21tsm02-doong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063947S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"4512051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4512051","articleId":"4512059","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4512071,"authors":[{"name":"Allan Gu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/66/4512051/4512071/4512071-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Allan Gu (M'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering, in 2007, both from the University of California, Berkeley.","His research interests include signal processing, machine learning, numerical simulations, and applications to semiconductor manufacturing.

In model-based OPC, masks are systematically modified to compensate for the nonideal optical and process effects of an optical lithography system. The polygons in the layout are fragmented, and simulations are performed to determine the image intensity pattern on the wafer. If the simulated pattern on the wafer does not match the desired one, the mask is perturbed by moving the fragments. This iterative process continues until the pattern on the wafer matches the desired one. Although OPC increases the fidelity of pattern transfer to the wafer, it is quite CPU intensive due to the simulations performed at each iteration. In this paper, linear regression techniques from statistical learning are used to predict the fragment movements. The goal is to reduce the number of iterations required in model-based OPC by using a fast, computationally efficient linear regression solution as the initial guess to model-based OPC. Experimental results show that fragment movement predictions via linear regression model significantly decrease the number of iterations required in model-based OPC, thereby decreasing the product development time in IC design and manufacturing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4512071/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10140634","htmlLink":"/document/4512071/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optical Proximity Correction With Linear Regression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Proximity Correction With Linear Regression","sourcePdf":"21tsm02-gu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065674S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"4512051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4512051","articleId":"4512071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4512089,"authors":[{"name":"Kyung Seung Ahn","affiliation":["Telecommunications R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung Seung","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37285028500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4512089","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":640},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Channel estimation","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Array signal processing","Radiofrequency interference","Fading","Closed-form solution","Statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","cochannel interference","correlation methods","diversity reception","error analysis","fading channels","MIMO communication","modulation","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-MRC system","multiple-input multiple-output wireless communication","maximum ratio combining","beamforming","channel estimation","cochannel interference","correlation coefficient","fading channel","statistical distribution","probability","modulation","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation error","cochannel interference (CCI)","maximum ratio combining (MRC)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we analyze the performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communications with transmit beamforming and maximum ratio combining (MRC), known as MIMO-MRC, with channel estimation error in the presence of cochannel interferences (CCIs).

Two alternative lens configurations are evaluated numerically and experimentally: one is based on modified axial-symmetric dome lens geometry, and the other one consists of a full 3-D double-shell lens antenna. In contrast to current nearly omnidirectional antennas, the directivity of our lens prototypes is above 15.4 dBi. Up to 4.2 dB loss obtained in the prototypes can be significantly reduced by using lower loss dielectrics and matching layers, without affecting the conclusions.

Multiresonant operation is achieved through the use of a bent tuning stub, a shorting strip line, a U-shaped slit and the addition of a narrow resonant slit to the main radiator. The first resonant frequency is determined by the main radiator of the proposed antenna, and the second resonant frequency is controlled by the length of the bent tuning stub. The third resonant frequency is generated by adding a narrow resonant slit to the perimeter of the main radiator. The three resonant frequencies of the designed antenna can be independently controlled by tuning the length of the individual elements of the proposed antenna. The measurement shows the intended four wireless communication services: global system for mobile communication (GSM900), digital communication system (DCS1800), US-personal communication system (US-PCS), and satellite-digital multimedia broadcasting (S-DMB). The proposed antenna is small enough to be built into a practical wireless mobile handset.

The difficulty in applying interpolation approaches to the fast varying phase term in the integral equation kernel for full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulations is eradicated by using the phase compensation and adaptive direction separation (ADS). The multilevel tree structure in MLGFIM keeps the number of direction separation invariant at all levels, attributing to the recursive interpolation with multilevel phase compensation. The proposed MLGFIM-APC in conjunction with the Lagrange-Chebyshev interpolation yield an O(N log N) CPU time and O(N) computer memory requirement for surface scattering problems. By introducing a transition level, the MLGFIM-APC can adaptively incorporate interpolation techniques of conventional interpolation (CI), transition interpolation (TI) and phase-compensation interpolation (PI), corresponding to electromagnetic simulation of problems of small, moderate, and large electrical sizes, respectively. Large-scale microstrip antenna arrays are simulated to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. It is found that the CPU time scales better than O(N log N) for these co-planar problems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Multilevel Green's Function Interpolation Method With Adaptive Phase Compensation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.922611","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4512125/04512148.pdf","startPage":"1381","endPage":"1393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.922611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4512125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4512148","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4512148/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Multilevel Green's Function Interpolation Method With Adaptive Phase Compensation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9992874","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Multilevel Green's Function Interpolation Method With Adaptive Phase Compensation","sourcePdf":"56tap05-lli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046002S","chronDate":"May  2008","isNumber":"4512125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"16","articleId":"4512148","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4512150,"authors":[{"name":"Hoi-Shun Lui","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hoi-Shun","lastName":"Lui","id":"37410594400"},{"name":"Nicholas V.

The influence of radiation efficiency on diversity gain and MIMO capacity of wireless communications systems is investigated through simulations and measurements using a reverberation chamber. Integrated antennas on a portable device have efficiencies low enough to disallow typical inter-element correlation assumptions. Both diversity gain and MIMO capacity depend on the number of antennas, SNR and efficiency in a complex way. When the efficiency of antennas is considered, certain system capacity losses are predicted and measured. These losses may be recovered through using more receive elements than commonly recommended or through the addition of a smaller number of more efficient antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4512125/04512164.pdf","startPage":"1444","endPage":"1450","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.922208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.922208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4512125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4512164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Influence of Efficiency on Receive Diversity and MIMO Capacity for Rayleigh-Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel capacity","Rayleigh channels","Diversity methods","Antenna measurements","Guidelines","Antenna arrays","Wireless communication","Gain measurement","Reverberation chamber"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","diversity reception","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh-fading channel","MIMO antenna arrays","wireless communications system","reverberation chamber","inter-element correlation assumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diversity gain","channel capacity","multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems","radiation efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4512164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"The Influence of Efficiency on Receive Diversity and MIMO Capacity for Rayleigh-Fading Channels","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4512164/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9992887","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Influence of Efficiency on Receive Diversity and MIMO Capacity for Rayleigh-Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"56tap05-valenzuelavaldes.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088184S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4512125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4512125","articleId":"4512164","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4512167,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Liang Yu","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, China and Center for Signal Processing, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4512125/4512167/4512167-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhu Liang Yu (S'03\u2013M'06) received the B.S.E.E. and the M.S.E.E. degrees both in electronic engineering from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 1995 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2006.","He worked in Shanghai Bell Co., Ltd., as a Software Engineer from 1998 to 2000.

With new constraints on the magnitude response, the beamwidth and response ripple of the robust response region can be well controlled. Moreover, only a small part of these inequality constraints on the magnitude response are active during optimization so that few degrees of freedom (DOFs) of the adaptive beamformer are consumed. Consequently, the resultant beamformer has significant improvement on signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). An important problem in the proposed beamformer is how to generate the array weight vector from the optimal semidefinite matrix. In this paper, a method utilizing the extended spectral factorization method is proposed to solve this problem. Simple implementation, flexible performance control as well as significant SINR enhancement support the practicability of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.922644","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4512125/04512167.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4512125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.922644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"1297","endPage":"1307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Adaptive Beamformer Based on Semidefinite Programming (SDP) With Magnitude Response Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4512167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Adaptive Beamformer Based on Semidefinite Programming (SDP) With Magnitude Response Constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4512167/","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4512167/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9981078","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Adaptive Beamformer Based on Semidefinite Programming (SDP) With Magnitude Response Constraints","sourcePdf":"56tap05-yu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086883S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4512125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4512125","articleId":"4512167","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4512171,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaowen Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Microwave Engineering, School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowen","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37962652100"},{"name":"Shiwen Yang","affiliation":["Department of Microwave Engineering, School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shiwen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37336142200"},{"name":"Zaiping Nie","affiliation":["Department of Microwave Engineering, School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zaiping","lastName":"Nie","id":"37271589400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"4512171","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":455},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear antenna arrays","Chirp modulation","Frequency domain analysis","Antenna arrays","Switches","Frequency modulation","Radio frequency","Apertures","Antenna radiation patterns","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aperture antennas","frequency modulation","linear antenna arrays","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency domain full-wave simulation","time modulated linear antenna array","variable aperture size time scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna arrays","frequency-domain","time modulation"]}],"abstract":"An effective frequency domain full-wave approach is proposed for the simulation of time modulated (TM) linear arrays with variable aperture size (VAS) time schemes.

A method by which this limitation can be removed and accurate simulation can be carried out for all time has been outlined in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/SPI.2007.4512233","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Signal Propagation on Interconnects","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Signal Propagation on Interconnects","pdfPath":"/iel5/4475927/4512188/04512233.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPI.2007.4512233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4512188","startPage":"141","endPage":"144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast FDTD simulation of multiscale 3D models using laguerre-MNA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4512233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast FDTD simulation of multiscale 3D models using laguerre-MNA","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4512233/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9967080","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4512233/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast FDTD simulation of multiscale 3D models using laguerre-MNA","confLoc":"Ruta di Camogli, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-05032008-00045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034231S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4475927","isNumber":"4512188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4475927","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4512188","articleId":"4512233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4512296,"authors":[{"name":"Rohit Nayak","affiliation":["School of Engineering, San Francisco State University, USA"],"firstName":"Rohit","lastName":"Nayak","id":"38094073000"},{"name":"Ying Chen","affiliation":["School of Engineering, San Francisco State University, USA"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Chen","id":"37068999500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2296-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2297-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4512296","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"abstract":"Video compression requires high level of computation complexity at every stage especially motion estimation.

The proposed method relies on classifying a given unlabeled sample by first finding its k-nearest training samples. A local partition of the input feature space is then carried out by means of local support vector machine (SVM) decision boundaries determined after training a multiclass SVM classifier on the considered k training samples. The labeling of the unknown sample is done by looking at the local decision region to which it belongs. The method is characterized by resulting global decision boundaries of the piecewise linear type. However, the entire process can be kernelized through the determination of the k -nearest training samples in the transformed feature space by using a distance function simply reformulated on the basis of the adopted kernel. To illustrate the performance of the proposed method, an experimental analysis on three different remote sensing datasets is reported and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.916090","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4524010/04512325.pdf","startPage":"1804","endPage":"1811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.916090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4524010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nearest Neighbor Classification of Remote Sensing Images With the Maximal Margin Principle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4512325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4512325/","displayDocTitle":"Nearest Neighbor Classification of Remote Sensing Images With the Maximal Margin Principle","volume":"46","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10002950","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4512325/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nearest Neighbor Classification of Remote Sensing Images With the Maximal Margin Principle","sourcePdf":"46tgrs06-blanzieri.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068128S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4524010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"4524010","articleId":"4512325","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":4512326,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Chini","affiliation":["Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4524010/4512326/4512326-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Chini received the Laurea (M.S.) degree in electronic engineering from University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d Rome, Italy, in 2003.

Both maximum-likelihood and neural network classifiers are used to validate a new parallel architecture which improves the accuracy when applied to VHR satellite imagery for the study of land-cover change between sequential satellite acquisitions. An enhancement of about 14% was found between the single-step classification and the new parallel architecture, confirming the advantage and the robust improvement obtained with this architecture regardless of the classification algorithm used.

This can be a problem in modern CMOS process technologies where device threshold voltages do not scale as much as the supply voltage, but is exacerbated in older CMOS/BiCMOS process technologies where very-low threshold voltage devices are unavailable. To address this issue, the use of an optimized bootstrapped CMOS switch is proposed in this paper. A linearized CMOS switch offers a constant on-resistance over the entire input signal range, greatly reducing track-mode distortion in a sampling circuit, compared to using a standard CMOS switch or a bootstrapped nMOS switch. The dynamic range improvement achieved as a result of the proposed technique is validated with the design of two high dynamic range fourth-order switched-capacitor DeltaSigma modulators for GSM and WCDMA radio standards in a 0.35-mum BiCMOS process technology. Measured spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 86 and 77 dB at power consumptions of 7 and 14 mW, respectively, are achieved for GSM and WCDMA standards. Each modulator operates from a single 2.7-V power supply and occupies an area of 0.2 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n .","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.924883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4684845/04512336.pdf","startPage":"3234","endPage":"3245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.924883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant-Resistance CMOS Input Sampling Switch for GSM/WCDMA High Dynamic Range - Modulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4512336/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Constant-Resistance CMOS Input Sampling Switch for GSM/WCDMA High Dynamic Range <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex>$\\Delta \\Sigma$</tex></formula> Modulators","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4512336/","accessionNumber":"10346650","volume":"55","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant-Resistance CMOS Input Sampling Switch for GSM/WCDMA High Dynamic Range <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex>$\\Delta \\Sigma$</tex></formula> Modulators","sourcePdf":"55tcsi10-adeniran.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155288S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4684845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4684845","articleId":"4512336","onlineDate":"12 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4512347,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This makes the accurate experimental measurement/determination of these characteristics a difficult task. This paper presents a comprehensive discussion and analysis on the different (most practiced) computer-based methods for the determination of these characteristics for a typical SRM. A digital signal processor (DSP)-based completely automated SRM drive system has been used for these studies. For all the offline computations, user-friendly MATLAB/Simulink-based models have been developed. The experimental methods, computational models, measurement results, and appropriate postmortem discussions for the determination of static flux linkage, inductance, and electromagnetic torque characteristics for an 8/6 four-phase SRM are reported.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4512347/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","volume":"57","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10207898","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4512347/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Experimental Investigations on Computer-Based Methods for Determination of Static Electromagnetic Characteristics of Switched Reluctance Motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Investigations on Computer-Based Methods for Determination of Static Electromagnetic Characteristics of Switched Reluctance Motors","sourcePdf":"57tim10-gobbi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063976S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4624644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4624644","articleId":"4512347","onlineDate":"12 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":4512350,"authors":[{"name":"Shun-Sheng Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shun-Sheng","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37686697600"},{"name":"Kuo-Chih Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuo-Chih","lastName":"Wei","id":"37069584900"},{"name":"Cheng-Ying Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Ying","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37556366200"},{"name":"Huey Ru-Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Huey","lastName":"Ru-Chuang","id":"38320530900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"4512350","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":141,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3731},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Yagi-Uda antennas","Millimeter wave technology","CMOS process","Coplanar waveguides","Antenna measurements","Electromagnetic measurements","Electromagnetic waveguides","CMOS technology","Reflector antennas","Antenna feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","CMOS integrated circuits","coplanar waveguide components","millimetre wave antennas","personal area networks","Yagi antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter-wave CPW-fed Yagi antenna","feeding network","coplanar waveguide","six-metal-layer CMOS process","on-chip antenna","CPW-to-coplanar-stripline feed transition","reflector strip","antenna power gain","antenna radiation efficiency","wireless personal area network","VSWR","frequency 60 GHz","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","coplanar stripline (CPS)","coplanar waveguide (CPW)","millimeter wave","on-chip antenna","wireless personal area network (WPAN)","Yagi","60 GHz"]},{"kwd":["CMOS","coplanar stripline (CPS)","coplanar waveguide (CPW)","millimeter wave","on-chip antenna","wireless personal area network (WPAN)","Yagi","60 GHz"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a 60-GHz millimeter-wave on-chip Yagi antenna fabricated with a 0.18-mum CMOS process.

In addition to forwarding packets, routers mix (i.e., code) packets from different sources to increase the information content of each transmission. We show that intelligently mixing packets increases network throughput. Our design is rooted in the theory of network coding. Prior work on network coding is mainly theoretical and focuses on multicast traffic. This paper aims to bridge theory with practice; it addresses the common case of unicast traffic, dynamic and potentially bursty flows, and practical issues facing the integration of network coding in the current network stack. We evaluate our design on a 20-node wireless network, and discuss the results of the first testbed deployment of wireless network coding.

In grids there exist users and service providers. The service providers provide the service for jobs that the users generate. Typically the amount of jobs generated by all the users are more than any single provider can handle alone with any acceptable quality of service (QoS). As such, the service providers need to cooperate and allocate jobs among them so that each is providing an acceptable QoS to their customers. QoS is of particular concerns to service providers as it directly affects customers' satisfaction and loyalty. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic solution to the QoS sensitive, grid job allocation problem. We model the QoS based, grid job allocation problem as a cooperative game and present the structure of the Nash Bargaining Solution. The proposed algorithm is fair to all users and represents a Pareto optimal solution to the QoS objective. One advantage of our scheme is the relatively low overhead and robust performance against inaccuracies in performance prediction information.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2008.79","startPage":"1413","endPage":"1422","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4607764/04515857.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4607764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cooperative Game Framework for QoS Guided Job Allocation Schemes in Grids","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Heuristic algorithms","Games","Quality of service","Dynamic scheduling","Load management","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["customer satisfaction","game theory","grid computing","Pareto optimisation","quality of service","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative game framework","QoS","job allocation schemes","high performance computing systems","communication links","service providers","customer satisfaction","grid job allocation problem","Nash bargaining solution","Pareto optimal solution","performance prediction information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Load balancing and task assignment","Heterogeneous (hybrid) systems","Distributed architectures","Scheduling and task partitioning"]},{"kwd":["Load balancing and task assignment","Heterogeneous (hybrid) systems","Distributed architectures","Scheduling and task partitioning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4515857/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Cooperative Game Framework for QoS Guided Job Allocation Schemes in Grids","volume":"57","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4515857/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10180415","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cooperative Game Framework for QoS Guided Job Allocation Schemes in Grids","sourcePdf":"ttc2008101413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06622S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4607764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4607764","articleId":"4515857","onlineDate":"12 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4515858,"authors":[{"name":"Tim G\u00fcneysu","affiliation":["Horst G\u00f6rtz Institute for IT-Security, Ruhr University of Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4633723/4515858/4515858-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tim G\u00fcneysu has studied international information technology and IT security at the University of Cooperative Education Mannheim, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany, and the University of Stafford, United Kingdom.

The security parameters of cryptographic algorithms are commonly chosen so that attacks are infeasible with available computing resources. Thus, in the absence of mathematical breakthroughs to a cryptanalytical problem, a promising way for tackling the computations involved is to build special-purpose hardware exhibiting a (much) better performance-cost ratio than off-the-shelf computers. This contribution presents a variety of cryptanalytical applications utilizing the cost-optimized parallel code breaker (COPACOBANA) machine, which is a high-performance low-cost cluster consisting of 120 field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). COPACOBANA appears to be the only such reconfigurable parallel FPGA machine optimized for code breaking tasks reported in the open literature. Depending on the actual algorithm, the parallel hardware architecture can outperform conventional computers by several orders of magnitude. In this work, we focus on novel implementations of cryptanalytical algorithms, utilizing the impressive computational power of COPACOBANA. We describe various exhaustive key search attacks on symmetric ciphers and demonstrate an attack on a security mechanism employed in the electronic passport (e-passport). Furthermore, we describe time-memory trade-off techniques that can, e.g., be used for attacking the popular A5/1 algorithm used in GSM voice encryption. In addition, we introduce efficient implementations of more complex cryptanalysis on asymmetric cryptosystems, e.g., elliptic curve cryptosystems (ECCs) and number cofactorization for RSA. Even though breaking RSA or elliptic curves with parameter lengths used in most practical applications is out of reach with COPACOBANA, our attacks on algorithms with artificially short bit lengths allow us to extrapolate more reliable security estimates for real-world bit lengths. This is particularly useful for deriving estimates about the longevity of asymmetric key lengths.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","field programmable gate arrays","parallel architectures","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptanalysis","COPACOBANA","security parameters","cryptographic algorithms","cost-optimized parallel code breaker machine","reconfigurable parallel FPGA machine","parallel hardware architecture","electronic passport","A5/1 algorithm","GSM voice encryption","elliptic curve cryptosystems","number cofactorization","RSA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Special-Purpose and Application-Based Systems","Reconfigurable hardware","Cryptanalysis"]},{"kwd":["Special-Purpose and Application-Based Systems","Reconfigurable hardware","Cryptanalysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4515858","doi":"10.1109/TC.2008.80","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4633723/04515858.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.80","startPage":"1498","endPage":"1513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4633723","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cryptanalysis with COPACOBANA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cryptanalysis with COPACOBANA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4515858/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4515858/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10208627","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cryptanalysis with COPACOBANA","sourcePdf":"ttc2008111498.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095513S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4633723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"4633723","articleId":"4515858","onlineDate":"12 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4515880,"authors":[{"name":"Daisuke Miyagi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Daisuke","lastName":"Miyagi","id":"37269654300"},{"name":"Masafumi Umabuchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Masafumi","lastName":"Umabuchi","id":"37313568500"},{"name":"Norio Takahashi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Norio","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37277509800"},{"name":"Osami Tsukamoto","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Osami","lastName":"Tsukamoto","id":"37269326600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8223"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2515"},{"format":"CD","value":"2378-7074"}],"articleNumber":"4515880","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"The IEEE Council on Superconductivity","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/csc/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic analysis","Nonlinear magnetics","Magnetic properties","Magnetization","Magnetic losses","High temperature superconductors","Conductors","Magnetic fields","Superconducting magnets","Superconducting epitaxial layers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","high-temperature superconductors","magnetisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FEM","magnetization loss","coated conductor","magnetic substrate","external AC magnetic fields","finite element method","nonlinear E-J characteristic","nonlinear magnetic property"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coated conductor","finite element method","magnetic substrate","magnetization loss","nonlinear magnetic property"]}],"abstract":"We studied the magnetization loss characteristics of the HTS layer of the coated conductor with magnetic substrate.

Each ensemble is obtained by varying the patterns used to train the classifiers and extracting from each image two feature vectors for each feature extraction method: one for the upper part of the image and one for the lower part of the image. A different radial basis function support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained using each feature vector; finally, these classifiers are combined by the ldquosum rule.rdquo Experiments are performed on a large data set consisting of 4000 pedestrian and more than 25 000 nonpedestrian images captured in outdoor urban environments. Experimental results confirm that the different feature representations give complementary information, which has been exploited by fusion rules, and we have shown that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches among pedestrian detectors.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Feature extraction","Object detection","Laplace equations","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Infrared imaging","Image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","radial basis function networks","road traffic","support vector machines","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple pedestrian representations","pedestrian detection","feature representation schemes","pedestrian images","Laplacian EigenMaps","Gabor filters","invariant local binary patterns","feature extraction method","radial basis function support vector machine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gabor filters","invariant local binary patterns (LBPs)","Laplacian EigenMaps (LEMs)","multiclassifier","pedestrian detection"]},{"kwd":["Gabor filters","invariant local binary patterns (LBPs)","Laplacian EigenMaps (LEMs)","multiclassifier","pedestrian detection"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4538004","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2008.922882","startPage":"365","endPage":"369","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/4538004/04515883.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2008.922882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensemble of Multiple Pedestrian Representations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ensemble of Multiple Pedestrian Representations","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10034939","publicationDate":"June 2008","volume":"9","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2008","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4515883/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4515883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensemble of Multiple Pedestrian Representations","sourcePdf":"09tits02-nanni-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065412S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"4538004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4538004","articleId":"4515883","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":4515884,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00c9 E.

This operation involves two vehicles (the overtaking and the overtaken) cooperatively driving, as well as the surveillance of any other vehicles that are involved in the maneuver. This operation consists of two lane changes-one from the right to the left lane of the road, and the other is to return to the right lane after passing. Lane-change maneuvers have been used to move into or out of a circulation lane or platoon; however, overtaking operations have not received much coverage in the literature. In this paper, we present an overtaking system for autonomous vehicles equipped with path-tracking and lane-change capabilities. The system uses fuzzy controllers that mimic human behavior and reactions during overtaking maneuvers. The system is based on the information that is supplied by a high-precision Global Positioning System and a wireless network environment. It is able to drive an automated vehicle and overtake a second vehicle that is driving in the same lane of the road.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4515884/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4515884/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10180292","volume":"9","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Lane-Change Fuzzy Control in Autonomous Vehicles for the Overtaking Maneuver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lane-Change Fuzzy Control in Autonomous Vehicles for the Overtaking Maneuver","sourcePdf":"09tits03-naranjo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080138S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"4608839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"263","xplore-issue":"4608839","articleId":"4515884","onlineDate":"12 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4515885,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Physical Electronics and Devices of the Ministry of Education, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/4527042/4515885/4515885-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Juan Chen was born in Chongqing, China, in 1981.

Since the launches of TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed, high-resolution SAR imagery is readily available from every spot on the Earth, and multiple scattering image features will be increasingly found in many of these data. Some of the first TerraSAR-X images show the pyramids of Gizeh in a seemingly unexpected geometry. Instead of being geometrically distorted, the near-range faces of the pyramids look like ground projected. This letter explains this image puzzle by a mixture of two scattering effects. The theory is confirmed by an interferometric evaluation. The discussed image artifact can be seen as representative for many other multiple-scattering SAR imaging scenarios in high-resolution images. This letter also demonstrates once again that the interpretation of complex scattering configurations benefits from interferometric information.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar scattering","Synthetic aperture radar","Geometry","Radar polarimetry","Spaceborne radar","Interferometry","Remote sensing","Radar imaging","Optical reflection","Soil"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gizeh pyramids","TerraSAR-X imagery","SAR scattering mechanisms","synthetic aperture radar","image interpretation","man made structures","COSMO-SkyMed imagery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple scattering","SAR imaging geometry","SAR interferometry","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"]},{"kwd":["Multiple scattering","SAR imaging geometry","SAR interferometry","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2008.919378","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4567424/04515904.pdf","startPage":"468","endPage":"470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2008.919378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Pyramids of Gizeh Seen by TerraSAR-X\u2014A Prime Example for Unexpected Scattering Mechanisms in SAR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4515904","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Pyramids of Gizeh Seen by TerraSAR-X\u2014A Prime Example for Unexpected Scattering Mechanisms in SAR","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4515904/","volume":"5","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4515904/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10115245","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Pyramids of Gizeh Seen by TerraSAR-X\u2014A Prime Example for Unexpected Scattering Mechanisms in SAR","sourcePdf":"05lgrs03-bamler.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028699S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4567424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4567424","articleId":"4515904","onlineDate":"12 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4515907,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Trucco","affiliation":["Acoustic, Antennas Arrays,  and Underwater Signals (A3US) Laboratory,  Signal Processing and Telecommunications Group,  Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering (DIBE), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/4624644/4515907/4515907-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrea Trucco (S'93\u2013A'99\u2013SM'03) was born in Genoa, Italy, in 1970.

Critical issues in the development of high-resolution 3-D sonar systems are 1) the cost of hardware, which is associated with the huge number of sensors that compose the planar array, and 2) the computational burden of processing the signals that were gathered. Here, such problems are overcome by the optimized synthesis of an aperiodic sparse array that allows the device to operate at different frequencies, yielding an acceptable sidelobe level and a good tradeoff between the field of view and the resolution. The array optimization is performed using an efficient stochastic method, in which the number of sensors is minimized, whereas their positions and weights are simultaneously optimized. To test the validity of the designed system, the signals that the sparse array received in response to the insonification of a scene with a wideband pulse are simulated, and voxel-based beamforming is applied to generate the 3-D image. The obtained images show high fidelity to the geometrical characteristics of the scene, in accordance with the expected performance of the 3-D sonar system.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2008.922111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4624644/04515907.pdf","startPage":"2348","endPage":"2354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2008.922111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4624644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Devising an Affordable Sonar System for Underwater 3-D Vision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4515907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4515907/","displayDocTitle":"Devising an Affordable Sonar System for Underwater 3-D Vision","volume":"57","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10207915","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4515907/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Devising an Affordable Sonar System for Underwater 3-D Vision","sourcePdf":"57tim10-trucco.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069612S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4624644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4624644","articleId":"4515907","onlineDate":"12 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4515947,"authors":[{"name":"Adriana Becker-Gomez","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Adriana","lastName":"Becker-Gomez","id":"38295323300"},{"name":"T.

The circuit provides an output voltage equal to the bandgap voltage having a low output resistance and allows resistive loading. It does not use resistors or operational amplifiers. Thus, the design is suitable for fabrication in any digital CMOS technology. The circuit uses a current conveyor and current mirrors to convert the proportional to absolute temperature voltage into a current using a MOSFET. The current is converted back to a voltage by using the functional inverse of the FET v-i characteristics. This makes the voltage gain linear and temperature independent. The absence of back-gate bias is the reason for achieving the low supply voltage of operation. Simulation results using the transistor models for the 0.18-mum TSMC process show that the voltage-variation over the temperature range 0 to 100degC is <1 mV.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2008.921580","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4567625/04515947.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2008.921580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Supply-Voltage CMOS Sub-Bandgap Reference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4515947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Supply-Voltage CMOS Sub-Bandgap Reference","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4515947/","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10117790","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4515947/","volume":"55","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Supply-Voltage CMOS Sub-Bandgap Reference","sourcePdf":"55tcsii07-beckergomez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08132S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4567625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4567625","articleId":"4515947","onlineDate":"12 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4515949,"authors":[{"name":"Hairong Yu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hairong","lastName":"Yu","id":"38257044300"},{"name":"Mau-Chung Frank Chang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mau-Chung Frank","lastName":"Chang","id":"38183724300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4515949","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1940},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4515949","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Calibration","Circuits","Analog-digital conversion","Bandwidth","Voltage","Sampling methods","Prototypes","Power dissipation","Linearity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","analogue-digital conversion","CMOS memory circuits","convertors","flash memories","nanoelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-calibrated flash analog-to-digital converter","digital CMOS","analog input bandwidth","power dissipation","self-biased track-and-hold amplifier","ADC full-scale voltage","Nyquist-band","suprious-free dynamic range","frequency 10 MHz","frequency 600 MHz","frequency 1.3 GHz","voltage 1 V","size 90 nm","power 207 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Calibration","flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC)","offset correction","source follower","unity-gain buffer"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2008.921596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4567625/04515949.pdf","startPage":"668","endPage":"672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2008.921596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1-V 1.25-GS/S 8-Bit Self-Calibrated Flash ADC in 90-nm Digital CMOS","abstract":"We present an 8-bit 1.25-GS/s flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC) in 90-nm digital CMOS with wide analog input bandwidth and low power dissipation.

We propose a soft-decision interpolation technique that estimates missing pixels in groups rather than one at a time. The new technique learns and adapts to varying scene structures using a 2-D piecewise autoregressive model. The model parameters are estimated in a moving window in the input low-resolution image. The pixel structure dictated by the learnt model is enforced by the soft-decision estimation process onto a block of pixels, including both observed and estimated. The result is equivalent to that of a high-order adaptive nonseparable 2-D interpolation filter. This new image interpolation approach preserves spatial coherence of interpolated images better than the existing methods, and it produces the best results so far over a wide range of scenes in both PSNR measure and subjective visual quality. Edges and textures are well preserved, and common interpolation artifacts (blurring, ringing, jaggies, zippering, etc.) are greatly reduced.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.924279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4515964/04515976.pdf","startPage":"887","endPage":"896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.924279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4515964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Interpolation by Adaptive 2-D Autoregressive Modeling and Soft-Decision Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4515976","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4515976/","displayDocTitle":"Image Interpolation by Adaptive 2-D Autoregressive Modeling and Soft-Decision Estimation","volume":"17","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"9966251","pubMedId":"18482884","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4515976/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Interpolation by Adaptive 2-D Autoregressive Modeling and Soft-Decision Estimation","sourcePdf":"17tip06-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064945S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4515964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"419","xplore-issue":"4515964","articleId":"4515976","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":4515986,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The outputs of two external cavity SCLs phase-locked to a common reference laser are coherently combined, and the variation in the relative optical path lengths of the combining beams is corrected by dynamically changing the phase of the offset radio-frequency signal fed into one of the OPLLs by means of a VCO. A stable power combination efficiency of 94% is achieved. This inherently different method of phase control, i.e., electronic rather than the use of electrooptic crystals, is deemed essential for new applications involving coherent optoelectronics.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2008.922335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/4509497/04515997.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2008.922335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509497","startPage":"897","endPage":"899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-Controlled Apertures Using Heterodyne Optical Phase-Locked Loops","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4515997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phase-Controlled Apertures Using Heterodyne Optical Phase-Locked Loops","chronOrPublicationDate":"June1,  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4515997/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"11","publicationDate":"June1, 2008","accessionNumber":"9966195","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4515997/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-Controlled Apertures Using Heterodyne Optical Phase-Locked Loops","sourcePdf":"20lpt11-satyan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126988S","chronDate":"June1,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"4509497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4509497","articleId":"4515997","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4516001,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Tang","affiliation":["Victoria Research Laboratory, National ICT Australia, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37290774700"},{"name":"Keang-Po Ho","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Keang-Po","lastName":"Ho","id":"37276278800"},{"name":"William Shieh","affiliation":["ARC Special Research Centre for Ultra-Broadband Information Networks, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Shieh","id":"37299254300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"4516001","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1147},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this letter, we analyze the transmitter design for coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) employing predistortion. Digital clipping and digital predistortion processes are introduced to the radio frequency OFDM transmitter to compensate the nonlinearity effect introduced by the optical in-phase/quadrature modulator. We first provide a detailed description of signal processing involved in digital clipping and predistortion. We then carry out a numerical simulation to identify the performance dependence on clipping ratio, digital-to-analog converter (DAC) resolution, and modulation index. We find that for quadrature phase-shift keying modulation, 4-bit DAC resolution is sufficient for the CO-OFDM transmitter to incur only 0.3-dB penalty while maintaining the excess modulation insertion loss less than 6.0 dB. The performance improvement of the predistorted transmitter over nonpredistorted one is also discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/4509497/04516001.pdf","startPage":"954","endPage":"956","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2008.922346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2008.922346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509497","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4516001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent Optical OFDM Transmitter Design Employing Predistortion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","OFDM","Optical design","Predistortion","Radio transmitters","Optical signal processing","Optical modulation","Signal resolution","Phase modulation","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","numerical analysis","OFDM modulation","optical losses","optical modulation","optical transmitters","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical OFDM transmitter design","coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","digital clipping","digital predistortion","radio frequency OFDM transmitter","optical modulator","signal processing","numerical simulation","digital-to-analog converter resolution","modulation index","quadrature phase-shift keying modulation","insertion loss","word length 4 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clipping ratio","coherent communications","digital-to-analog converter (DAC) resolution","optical modulator","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","predistortion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4516001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June1,  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Coherent Optical OFDM Transmitter Design Employing Predistortion","volume":"20","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4516001/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June1, 2008","accessionNumber":"9966198","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent Optical OFDM Transmitter Design Employing Predistortion","sourcePdf":"20lpt11-tang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056415S","chronDate":"June1,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"4509497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4509497","articleId":"4516001","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4516003,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Zhang","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37695925000"},{"name":"Hongwei Chen","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongwei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293460400"},{"name":"Zhijian Si","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhijian","lastName":"Si","id":"38057524300"},{"name":"Heng Ji","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Heng","lastName":"Ji","id":"37956149100"},{"name":"Shizhong Xie","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shizhong","lastName":"Xie","id":"37278013100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"4516003","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Fiber gratings","Bragg gratings","Phased arrays","Arrayed waveguide gratings","Multiaccess communication","Optical fiber networks","Sampling methods","Two dimensional displays","Optical fiber devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bragg gratings","code division multiple access","code division multiplexing","codecs","optical fibre communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FBG encoders","FBG decoders","2D time-wavelength OCDMA systems","fiber Bragg grating encoder","fiber Bragg grating decoder","2D time-spreading wavelength-hopping optical coding","optical code-division multiple-access system","reconstruction-equivalent-chirp technology","bit rate 5 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fiber Bragg grating (FBG)","optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA)"]}],"abstract":"A novel fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-based en/decoder for the two-dimensional (2D) time-spreading wavelength-hopping optical coding is proposed.

This paper describes a control approach for a robotics manipulator. In this paper, a multilayer feedforward network is applied to a robot visual servo control problem. The model uses a new neural network architecture and a new algorithm for modifying neural connection strength. No a-prior knowledge is required of robot kinematics and camera calibration. The network is trained using an end- effector position. After training, performance is measured by having the network generate joint-angles for arbitrary end effector trajectories. A 2-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) parallel manipulator was used for the study. It was discovered that neural networks provide a simple and effective way of controlling robotic tasks. This paper explores the application of a neural network for approximating nonlinear transformation relating to the robot's tip-position, from the image coordinates to its joint coordinates. Real experimental examples are given to illustrate the significance of this method. Experimental results are compared with a similar method called the Broyden method, for uncalibrated visual servo- control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 March 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4516044/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9982715","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4516044/","publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"26-28 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Uncalibrated visual servo control with neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncalibrated visual servo control with neural network","confLoc":"Trento, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-05052008-00018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051928S","chronDate":"26-28 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4498401","isNumber":"4516026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4498401","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4516026","articleId":"4516044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4516059,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The pivot friction nonlinearity is defined as the frictional hysteresis that occurs at the bearing of the actuator pivot in the hard disk drives. This nonlinear effect can be observed as a large gain reduction especially in the low-frequency range and will cause large residual errors and/or high-frequency oscillations which in turn affect track-following and seeking performance. Basically, the linear techniques were usually used to suppress the influences by raising the low-frequency gain but were limited b.y the Bode's gain-phase relationship. In this paper, an improved adaptive neural network (NN) controller is designed to compensate for the pivot nonlinearity. To capture the time- varying uncertainties and nonlinearity, the adaptive tuning scheme is employed for the NN weights and the width in RBF functions. The proposed scheme has the advantages of fast convergence for parameter estimation and improvement of high hump of the magnitude of closed-loop sensitivity function. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/AMC.2008.4516107","pdfPath":"/iel5/4498401/4516026/04516107.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"443","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th IEEE International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control","publicationTitle":"2008 10th IEEE International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AMC.2008.4516107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4516026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved adaptive neural network compensation of pivot nonlinearity in hard disk drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4516107/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"An improved adaptive neural network compensation of pivot nonlinearity in hard disk drives","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9982644","publicationDate":"March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4516107/","conferenceDate":"26-28 March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved adaptive neural network compensation of pivot nonlinearity in hard disk drives","confLoc":"Trento, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-05052008-00081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060482S","chronDate":"26-28 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4498401","isNumber":"4516026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4498401","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4516026","articleId":"4516107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4516108,"authors":[{"name":"Jure Cas","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science/Institute for Robotics, University of Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Jure","lastName":"Cas","id":"38093507500"},{"name":"Rok Klobucar","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science/Institute for Robotics, University of Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Rok","lastName":"Klobucar","id":"38093506900"},{"name":"Riko Safaric","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science/Institute for Robotics, University of Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Riko","lastName":"Safaric","id":"38094649500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1702-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1703-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-6572"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-6580"}],"articleNumber":"4516108","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Hysteresis","Piezoelectric actuators","Mathematical model","Sliding mode control","Position control","Micromanipulators","Springs","Glass","Friction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["micromanipulators","neurocontrollers","piezoelectric actuators","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based control algorithm","position control","2DOF micromanipulator","photo-sensitive micro-structured glass","piezoelectric actuator","Matlab-Simulink"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["control","micro-manipulator","neural network","piezoelectric actuator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4516108","abstract":"This paper describes a neural network based control approach for position control of a 2DOF micro-manipulator.

However, applications such as telephone banking etc. need extra security for making it a reliable service for the people. Application of PIN code/password via telephone is not enough and additional user specific information is required that can protect the user identity in a more effective way. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses interactive voice response (IVR) with pattern recognition based on neural networks. In this case, after entering the correct password the user is asked to input his voice sample which is used to verify his identity. The addition of voice pattern recognition in the authentication process can potentially further enhance the security level. As both are simultaneously applied so there is lesser probability of misuse. The developed system is fully compliant with hind line phone system.","doi":"10.1109/ICET.2007.4516352","startPage":"249","endPage":"252","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Emerging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509978/4516300/04516352.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Emerging Technologies","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2007.4516352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4516300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactive Voice Response with Pattern Recognition Based on Artificial Neural Network Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern recognition","Artificial neural networks","Telephony","Feature extraction","Speech","Authentication","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Speaker recognition","Spatial databases","Information security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive systems","neural nets","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive voice response","pattern recognition","artificial neural network approach","authentication process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interactive voice response","mel frequency cepstral coefficient","artificial neural network","pattern recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4516352/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Interactive Voice Response with Pattern Recognition Based on Artificial Neural Network Approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4516352/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"12-13 Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10040539","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive Voice Response with Pattern Recognition Based on Artificial Neural Network Approach","confLoc":"Rawalpindi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"ICET-00-52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060398S","chronDate":"12-13 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4509978","isNumber":"4516300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509978","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4516300","articleId":"4516352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4516448,"authors":[{"name":"Nawaf N.

With the FDTD method is very easy to model stratified dielectric objects like the human body, but to model antenna and human body together, the high resolution needed to model the radiating element leads to a strong increase of computational memory required. In the proposed technique the equivalence principle is used to separate the original problems into two sub-problems: 1) the antenna is analysed using CST Microwave Studio in free space; 2) the human body is handled with FDTD procedure. The described technique has been used to evaluate the on-body radiation pattern distortion for two different planar antennas at 2.4 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/LAPC.2008.4516889","publicationTitle":"2008 Loughborough Antennas and Propagation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Loughborough Antennas and Propagation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509975/4516839/04516889.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAPC.2008.4516889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4516839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysys of on-body antenna radiation pattern using a numerical technique based on FDTD and equivalence principle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4516889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 March 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4516889/","displayDocTitle":"Analysys of on-body antenna radiation pattern using a numerical technique based on FDTD and equivalence principle","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"10039661","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4516889/","conferenceDate":"17-18 March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysys of on-body antenna radiation pattern using a numerical technique based on FDTD and equivalence principle","confLoc":"Loughborough, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04484S","chronDate":"17-18 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509975","isNumber":"4516839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509975","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4516839","articleId":"4516889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4516890,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A matrix inversion normalized least mean square (MI-NLMS) adaptive beamforming algorithm was developed for OFDM system. The algorithm was developed by combining the sample matrix inversion (SMI) and the normalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithms taking the individual good aspects of both algorithms; the block adaptive and sample by sample techniques.

Simulation results showed that bit error rate (BER) improves 81 % by using 8 elements antenna array compared to single element antenna and 92% at 256 pilots compared to BER at 32 pilots for the MI-NLMS algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/LAPC.2008.4516943","publicationTitle":"2008 Loughborough Antennas and Propagation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Loughborough Antennas and Propagation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509975/4516839/04516943.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAPC.2008.4516943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4516839","startPage":"369","endPage":"372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MI-NLMS adaptive beamforming algorithm for OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4516943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MI-NLMS adaptive beamforming algorithm for OFDM system","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 March 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4516943/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-18 March 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"10039660","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4516943/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MI-NLMS adaptive beamforming algorithm for OFDM system","confLoc":"Loughborough, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031051S","chronDate":"17-18 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509975","isNumber":"4516839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509975","xplore-issue":"4516839","articleId":"4516943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4516954,"authors":[{"name":"Sun Xiangyang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Sun Xiangyang","id":"37693730500"},{"name":"Nie Zaiping","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Nie Zaiping","id":"37280883200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1893-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1894-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4516954","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"abstract":"Multicomponent induction logging responses are simulated by using higher order hierarchical vector finite element method (FEM).

This implies a great deal of communication; and it was recently proposed that by an intelligent quantization directly of measurements, the communication needs could be considerably cut. However, several issues were not discussed. The first of these is that estimation with quantized measurements requires an update with a non-Gaussian distribution, reflecting the uncertainty within the quantization \"bin.\"; In general this would be a difficult task for dynamic estimation, but Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC, and specifically here particle filtering) techniques appear quite appropriate since the resulting system is, in essence, a nonlinear filter. The second issue is that in a realistic sensor network it is to be expected that measurements should arrive out-of-sequence. Again, a particle filter is appropriate, since the recent literature has reported particle filter modifications that accommodate nonlinear-filter updates based on new past measurements, with the need to refilter obviated. We show results that indicate a compander/particle-filter combination is a natural fit, and specifically that quite good performance is achievable with only 2-3 bits per dimension per observation. The third issue is that intelligent quantization requires that both sensor and fuser share an understanding of the quantization rule. In dynamic estimation this is a problem since both quantizer and fuser are working with only partial information; if measurements arrive out-of-sequence the problem is compounded. We therefore suggest architectures, and comment on their suitabilities for the task. A scheme based on delta-modulation appears to be promising.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2008.4516986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4516981","startPage":"15","endPage":"29","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4516981/04516986.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical fusion of quantized measurements via particle filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4516986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4516986/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Practical fusion of quantized measurements via particle filtering","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2008","accessionNumber":"9943751","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"44","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical fusion of quantized measurements via particle filtering","sourcePdf":"44aes01-Ruan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088546S","chronDate":"January  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4516981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4516981","articleId":"4516986","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4516993,"authors":[{"name":"Darko Musicki","affiliation":["University of Newcastle, Victoria, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/4516981/4516993/4516993-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Darko Mu\u0161icki was born in Belgrade, Serbia, in 1957.

These algorithms are derived by integrating the interacting multiple model (IMM) estimation algorithm with the PDA approximation. Each IMM model a posteriori state estimate probability density function (pdf) is approximated by a single Gaussian pdf. Each algorithm recursively updates the probability of target existence, in the manner of integrated PDA (IPDA). The probability of target existence is a track quality measure, which can be used for false track discrimination. The first algorithm presented, IMM-IPDA, is a single target tracking algorithm. Two multitarget tracking algorithms are also presented. The IMM-JIPDA algorithm calculates a posteriori probabilities of all measurement to track allocations, in the manner of the joint IPDA (JIPDA). The number of measurement to track allocations grows exponentially with the number of shared measurements and the number of tracks which share the measurements. Therefore, IMM-JIPDA can only be used in situations with a small number of crossing targets and low clutter measurement density. The linear multitarget IMM-IPDA (IMM-LMIPDA) is also a multitarget tracking algorithm, which achieves the multitarget capabilities by integrating linear multitarget (LM) method with IMM-IPDA. When updating one track using the LM method, the other tracks modulate the clutter measurement density and are subsequently ignored. In this fashion, LM achieves multitarget capabilities using the number of operations which are linear in the: number of measurements and the number of tracks, and can be used in complex scenarios, with dense clutter and a large number of targets.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","State estimation","Trajectory","Approximation algorithms","Density measurement","Surveillance","Probability density function","Australia","Layout","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clutter","Gaussian processes","recursive estimation","state estimation","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IMM-IPDA-based algorithms","single-scan probabilistic data association","manoeuvering target tracking","interacting multiple model estimation algorithm","a posteriori state estimate probability density function","Gaussian pdf","integrated PDA","multitarget tracking algorithms","track allocations","clutter measurement density","linear multitarget method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAES.2008.4516993","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4516981/04516993.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4516981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2008.4516993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking in clutter using IMM-IPDA-based algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4516993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tracking in clutter using IMM-IPDA-based algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4516993/","volume":"44","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4516993/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9943758","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking in clutter using IMM-IPDA-based algorithms","sourcePdf":"44aes01-Musicki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062916S","chronDate":"January  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4516981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4516981","articleId":"4516993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4516996,"authors":[{"name":"Ruhai Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lamar University, Beaumont, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/4516981/4516996/4516996-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ruhai Wang (M'03) received a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from New Mexico State University, USA, in 2001.

This paper presents an experimental, comparative analysis of window-based transmission control, rate-based transmission control, and a hybrid of the two over error-prone, congestion-free, high-latency, point-to-point space communication links simulated using the space-to-ground link simulation (SGLS) test-bed. The results revealed that the traffic shaping mechanism of rate-based transmission protocol is more effective than the bursting flow of window-based protocol over simulated space communication links with a high error rate and a long link delay. The window-based transmission mechanisms show performance degradation due to traffic bursts and frequent packet retransmissions caused by their acknowledgment (ACK)-clocked transmission control algorithms. Pure rate-control is always preferable to other mechanisms in the simulated congestion-free, error-prone, point-to-point, geostationary-Earth orbit (GEO)-space communication channels, and its advantages become more pronounced when the channel rates are asymmetric. The performance differences come from their different behavior in controlling data transmission.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2008.4516996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4516981","startPage":"157","endPage":"170","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4516981/04516996.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Window-based and rate-based transmission control mechanisms over space-Internet links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4516996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4516996/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Window-based and rate-based transmission control mechanisms over space-Internet links","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2008","accessionNumber":"9943761","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"44","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Window-based and rate-based transmission control mechanisms over space-Internet links","sourcePdf":"44aes01-Wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077461S","chronDate":"January  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4516981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4516981","articleId":"4516996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4516997,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel R.

Here we propose the use of multiple signals with arbitrary cross-correlation matrix R, and show that R can be chosen to achieve or approximate a desired spatial transmit beampattern. Two specific problems are addressed. The first is the constrained optimization problem of finding the value of R which causes the true transmit beampattern to be close in some sense to a desired beampattern. This is approached using convex optimization techniques. The second is the problem of designing multiple constant-modulus waveforms with given cross-correlation R. The use of coded binary phase shift keyed (BPSK) waveforms is considered. A method for finding the code sequences based on random signaling with a structured correlation matrix is proposed. It is also shown that by restricting the class of admissible waveforms one reduces the set of possible signal correlation matrices.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2008.4516997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4516981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2008.4516997","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4516981/04516997.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit beamforming for MIMO radar systems using signal cross-correlation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Transmit beamforming for MIMO radar systems using signal cross-correlation","volume":"44","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4516997/","publicationDate":"January 2008","accessionNumber":"9943762","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4516997/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit beamforming for MIMO radar systems using signal cross-correlation","sourcePdf":"44aes01-Fuhrmann.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074079S","chronDate":"January  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4516981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"320","xplore-issue":"4516981","articleId":"4516997","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4516998,"authors":[{"name":"Omar A.

However, the computational complexity associated with obtaining the track estimate in many cases has precluded its use in real-time scenarios. Previous ML-PDA implementations used a multi-pass grid (MPG) search to find the track estimate. Two alternate methods for finding the track estimate are presented-a genetic search and a newly developed directed subspace (DSS) search algorithm. Each algorithm is tested using active sonar scenarios in which an autonomous underwater vehicle searches for and tracks a target. Within each scenario, the problem parameters are varied to illustrate the relative performance of each search technique. Both the DSS search and the genetic algorithm are shown to be an order of magnitude more computationally efficient than the MPG search, making possible real-time implementation. In addition, the DSS search is shown to be the most effective technique at tracking a target at the lowest SNR levels-reliable tracking down to 5 dB (postprocessing SNR in a resolution cell) using a 5-frame sliding window is demonstrated, this being 6 dB better than the MPG search.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2008.4516999","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4516981/04516999.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2008.4516999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4516981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directed subspace search ML-PDA with application to active sonar tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4516999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4516999/","displayDocTitle":"Directed subspace search ML-PDA with application to active sonar tracking","volume":"44","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2008","accessionNumber":"9943764","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4516999/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directed subspace search ML-PDA with application to active sonar tracking","sourcePdf":"44aes01-Blanding.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0664S","chronDate":"January  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4516981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4516981","articleId":"4516999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4517000,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/4516981/4517000/4517000-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian Sun (M'95) received the B.S. degree from Nanjing Institute of Aeronautics, Nanjing, China, in 1984, the M.S. degree from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China, in 1989, and the Dr. Eng.

The high line frequency of airborne AC power systems presents a major challenge for the design of PFC converters capable of meeting these standards. This paper investigates a new source of harmonic current distortion and the resulting system power quality problems related to dynamic interactions between PFC converters and the AC source. Experimental results are first presented to demonstrate the existence of such interactions and their effects on system power quality. Analytical and numerical simulation results are then presented to explain why such dynamic interactions can lead to significantly increased harmonic current distortion in steady state operation. Elimination of undesirable system interactions through proper damping of the PFC converter input filter is also presented and its effectiveness experimentally validated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aircraft power system harmonics involving single-phase PFC converters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2008.4517000","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4516981/04517000.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2008.4517000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4516981","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517000/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2008","displayDocTitle":"Aircraft power system harmonics involving single-phase PFC converters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4517000/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"January 2008","accessionNumber":"9943765","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aircraft power system harmonics involving single-phase PFC converters","sourcePdf":"44aes01-Sun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052439S","chronDate":"January  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4516981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4516981","articleId":"4517000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4517004,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Martorella","affiliation":["University of Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/4516981/4517004/4517004-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Martorella was born in Portoferraio, Italy, in June 1973.

In order to rescale the image in a homogeneous range-cross range domain (meters by meters), the modulus of the target effective rotation vector must be known. Although in some cases it can be retrieved by means of ancillary data, in most cases the modulus of the target effective rotation vector must be estimated. A blind technique is proposed for estimating the modulus of the target effective rotation vector that exploits information carried by the chirp rate of scattering centres. A technique based on image segmentation, local polynomial Fourier transform (LPFT), and image contrast (IC) maximisation is used in order to extract the scattering centres and estimate their chirp rate.

As utilities have a long view on equipment (designed is at least for 30-40 years of normal use), they are starting to request from switchgear manufacturers a viable long term solution. Fault current limiters are now requested by power utilities due to re- regulations in the US and elsewhere. Unfortunately, designs for new FCLs are still in its infancy, but many manufacturers are working on it. Plain electronic FCLs are less sophisticated that fast FCLs hybrid circuit breakers called electronic circuit breakers or e-CB. The DOE awarded a contract to EPRI to develop a 69 kV class Solid State Current Limiter. This program is planned to be completed in 2009. EPRI is subcontracting a prototype of the electronic FCL at 69 kV based on the new SGTO developed by a Pennsylvania company at 3000 A. The prototype is called a SSCL. The ultimate objective is to manufacture an e-CB at 145 kV for world wide applications. The description of the e-CB below shows that private applications on existing substations are already multiple at 15 kV and solutions from the private industry are entertained in the switchgear industry.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505447/4517029/04517050.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New network concepts using electronic hybrid circuit breakers","doi":"10.1109/TDC.2008.4517050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDC.2008.4517050","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"New network concepts using electronic hybrid circuit breakers","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10014077","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4517050/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New network concepts using electronic hybrid circuit breakers","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05072008-00021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048001S","chronDate":"21-24 April 2008","isNumber":"4517029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505447","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4517050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4517069,"authors":[{"name":"Belkacem Mahdad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Biskra, Biskra, Algeria"],"firstName":"Belkacem","lastName":"Mahdad","id":"37294399200"},{"name":"Tarek Bouktir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University\uc2a0of\uc2a0Oum El-Bouaghi, Oum El Bouaghi, Algeria"],"firstName":"Tarek","lastName":"Bouktir","id":"37294408500"},{"name":"Kamel Srairi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Biskra, Biskra, Algeria"],"firstName":"Kamel","lastName":"Srairi","id":"37294409600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1903-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1904-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-8555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-8563"}],"articleNumber":"4517069","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Genetic algorithms","Environmental economics","Power generation economics","Flexible AC transmission systems","Power system economics","Fuzzy reasoning","Energy management","Environmental management","Fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible AC transmission systems","fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","power transmission control","power transmission economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy controlled genetic algorithm","shunt FACTS devices","hybrid genetic algorithm","fuzzy logic rules","economic dispatch","shunt flexible AC transmission systems","multiobjective optimization problem","optimal power generation subproblem","flexible genetic algorithm","reactive index sensitivity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimal power flow","Economic dispatch(ED)","genetic algorithm constrained emission","Fuzzy logic","SVC","FACTS","reactive sensitivity index"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517069","abstract":"In recent year and with the growth in electricity demand, environmental considerations have become one of the major management concerns.

Some of the nonlinear characteristics of the generator, such as prohibited operating zones are considered using the proposed method in practical generator operation. In this paper, two executions of directional search genetic algorithm are used. In the first execution, it determines the dispatch of generators without considering Prohibited-operating zones. If there is no violation, the optimal dispatch is obtained. If there is a violation in units, set their limits, and then it uses an efficient approach to determine the most advantageous space using the average power of prohibited operating region. In the second execution, it obtains the optimal dispatch for the remaining units. The proposed method is very efficient for both small and large size of generating units with prohibited operating zones and it remarkably reduces the computation time.","doi":"10.1109/TDC.2008.4517076","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505447/4517029/04517076.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDC.2008.4517076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A directional search genetic algorithm to the economic dispatch problem with prohibited operating zones","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517076/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"A directional search genetic algorithm to the economic dispatch problem with prohibited operating zones","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10014103","publicationDate":"April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4517076/","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A directional search genetic algorithm to the economic dispatch problem with prohibited operating zones","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05072008-00047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063263S","chronDate":"21-24 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505447","isNumber":"4517029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505447","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4517029","articleId":"4517076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4517083,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Discrete wavelet transforms based multi-resolution signal decomposition technique is integrated with the feed-forward neural network model to develop the power quality problem classifier. Classification of the power quality problems has been carried out in two parts. In first part, multi-resolution signal decomposition analysis with Parseval's energy theorem is used to extract the energy features of the power quality signal. In the second part, this feature information is used to develop neural network classifier. The classifier has been tested on various disturbances viz. voltage sag, swell, momentary interruption, capacitor switching and single line to ground fault. Results obtained show the versatility of the classifier for classifying the most commonly power quality problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517083/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10014110","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517083/","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of power quality problems using wavelet based artificial neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of power quality problems using wavelet based artificial neural network","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05072008-00054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074734S","chronDate":"21-24 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505447","isNumber":"4517029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505447","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4517029","articleId":"4517083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4517181,"authors":[{"name":"M.

System components are loaded up to their thermal limits, and power trading with fast varying load patterns is leading to an increasing congestion. In addition to this, the dramatic global climate developments call for changes in the way electricity is supplied. Innovative solutions with HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) and FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission Systems) have the potential to cope with the new challenges. New power electronic technologies with self-commutated converters provide advanced technical features, such as independent control of active and reactive power, the capability to supply weak or passive networks and less space requirements. In many applications, the VSC (Voltage-Sourced Converter) has become a standard for self-commutated converters and will be increasingly more used in transmission and distribution systems in the future. This kind of converter uses power semiconductors with turn-off capability.","doi":"10.1109/TDC.2008.4517192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDC.2008.4517192","startPage":"1","endPage":"16","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505447/4517029/04517192.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prospects of multilevel VSC technologies for power transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517192/","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Prospects of multilevel VSC technologies for power transmission","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10014218","publicationDate":"April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4517192/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prospects of multilevel VSC technologies for power transmission","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05072008-00163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091346S","chronDate":"21-24 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505447","isNumber":"4517029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505447","citationCount":"274","xplore-issue":"4517029","articleId":"4517192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4517221,"authors":[{"name":"Chandrasekar Samudi","affiliation":["Kalki Communication Technologies Ltd., Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Chandrasekar","lastName":"Samudi","id":"38094428900"},{"name":"Gautham P.

The effectiveness and stochastic nature of proposed algorithm has been tested with standard test case and the results have been compared with earlier works. This paper also describes software developed for short term hydro-thermal scheduling by considering hydro economic dispatch and thermal unit commitment. The proposed algorithm is ideally suitable for hydro-thermal co-ordination problems, hydro economic dispatch problems with unit commitment, thermal economic dispatch with unit commitment problems and scheduling of hydraulically coupled plants.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505447/4517029/04517221.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/TDC.2008.4517221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDC.2008.4517221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517029","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hydro thermal scheduling using particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Scheduling algorithm","Stochastic processes","Power generation economics","Power generation","Communications technology","High temperature superconductors","Testing","Dynamic programming","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydrothermal power systems","particle swarm optimisation","power generation dispatch","power generation scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydro thermal scheduling","particle swarm optimization","PSO","hydro economic dispatch","thermal unit commitment","hydraulically coupled plants"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Hydrothermal coordination"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Hydro thermal scheduling using particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517221/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10014248","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hydro thermal scheduling using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05072008-00192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077461S","chronDate":"21-24 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505447","isNumber":"4517029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505447","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4517029","articleId":"4517221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4517244,"authors":[{"name":"Ken Mattern","affiliation":["S and C Electric Company, Orlando, FL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ken Mattern graduated from the Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA in 1973.

Analysis on the electromagnetic (EM) waves emitted from PD is useful from the viewpoint of noncontact diagnosis because PD emits wideband EM waves. The constrained interpolation profile method (CIP) is used to visualize the wideband EM waves emitted from PD for understanding the physical mechanism. The wideband EM waves are analyzed by using the in-place fast Haar wavelet transform(IP-FHWT), which can show the discrete time- frequency components. The PD is numerically obtained by the total amount of charge and the rise time. Numerical results show that the proposed method based on the CIP and the IP-FHWT is useful for analyzing the relationship between the PD current and the EM waves.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505447/4517029/04517292.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/TDC.2008.4517292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDC.2008.4517292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517029","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of wideband EM waves emitted from partial discharge using the constrained interpolation profile (CIP) method and the in-place fast haar wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Partial discharges","Interpolation","Wavelet analysis","Wavelet transforms","Partial discharge measurement","Power measurement","Electric variables measurement","Electromagnetic measurements","Dielectrics and electrical insulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic waves","Haar transforms","insulating materials","interpolation","partial discharges","power apparatus","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband EM waves","partial discharge","constrained interpolation profile method","in-place fast Haar Wavelet transform","insulation material","electric power equipment","electromagnetic waves"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Partial discharge (PD)","Electromagnetic (EM) waves","Constrained interpolation profile (CIP) method","the in-place fast Haar wavelet transform (IP-FHWT)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of wideband EM waves emitted from partial discharge using the constrained interpolation profile (CIP) method and the in-place fast haar wavelet transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517292/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10024902","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of wideband EM waves emitted from partial discharge using the constrained interpolation profile (CIP) method and the in-place fast haar wavelet transform","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05072008-00263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077024S","chronDate":"21-24 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505447","isNumber":"4517029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505447","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4517029","articleId":"4517292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4517336,"authors":[{"name":"Markos Papageorgiou","affiliation":["Dynamic Systems and Simulation Laboratory, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Markos","lastName":"Papageorgiou","id":"37272101300"},{"name":"Elias Kosmatopoulos","affiliation":["Dynamic Systems and Simulation Laboratory, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Kosmatopoulos","id":"37372596800"},{"name":"Ioannis Papamichail","affiliation":["Dynamic Systems and Simulation Laboratory, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Papamichail","id":"37589617200"},{"name":"Yibing Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Transport Studies, Department of Civil Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Yibing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37337391300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1524-9050"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0016"}],"articleNumber":"4517336","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":515},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society","url":"http://sites.ieee.org/itss/"}],"abstract":"In a recent series of articles with largely identical contents and results, some claims are raised about the pertinence and performance of the well-known and widely field-applied local ramp metering algorithm ALINEA and of some extended versions thereof.

After a presentation of the criteria and of the studied chamber, data issued from 3-D finite-difference time-domain simulations and measurements are used to analyze the chamber functioning by the use of these criteria. This study is performed on a large frequency band, in the lossless case as well as with a lossy chamber, and for several stirrer shapes, to emphasize the influence of these parameters. The comparison of the usual criteria with the SRKS shows the SKRS is an accurate test to estimate the lowest usable frequency of a given reverberation chamber.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2008.921049","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4527042/04517337.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2008.921049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4527042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison Between Different Criteria for Evaluating Reverberation Chamber Functioning Using a 3-D FDTD Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517337/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison Between Different Criteria for Evaluating Reverberation Chamber Functioning Using a 3-D FDTD Algorithm","volume":"50","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10002935","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517337/","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison Between Different Criteria for Evaluating Reverberation Chamber Functioning Using a 3-D FDTD Algorithm","sourcePdf":"50temc02-mengue.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094344S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"4527042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4527042","articleId":"4517337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4517339,"authors":[{"name":"Rajeev Nongpiur","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4684845/4517339/4517339-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rajeev Nongpiur (S'00\u2013M'05) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communications engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 1998 and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, in 2005.","From 1998 to 2000, he was with Wipro Technologies, Bangalore, India, as a Systems Engineer.

The analysis is based on two well-known models for the NEXT coupling factor, the Bradley and Lin models, and yields the minimum number of adaptive filters required to reduce the NEXT below a prescribed level to within a defined confidence factor. With the minimum number of adaptive filters known, the required computational resources for the application at hand can be estimated. The analysis is further extended to practical situations where the largest NEXT signals chosen for elimination are incorrectly detected, and estimates of the minimum and maximum increase in the uncanceled NEXT due to incorrect detection are then deduced. Simulations show that the estimated minimum number of adaptive filters required and the maximum and minimum increase in uncanceled NEXT due to incorrect detection are fairly close to corresponding estimates obtained on the basis of measurements for both the Bradley and the Lin models. Therefore, by using the proposed analysis the minimum number of adaptive filters can be deduced without the need for time-consuming and expensive experiments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crosstalk","Adaptive filters","Frequency","Computational modeling","DSL","Copper","Adaptive systems","Digital filters","Signal analysis","Least squares approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","crosstalk","digital filters","digital subscriber lines","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-end crosstalk cancellation system","adaptive digital filter","coupling factor","Bradley model","Lin model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filters","LMS algorithm","near-end crosstalk cancellation","xDSL systems"]},{"kwd":["Near-end crosstalk","cancelation","adaptive filters","LMS algorithm","xDSL systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.924871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4684845/04517339.pdf","startPage":"3306","endPage":"3316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.924871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analysis of a Near-End Crosstalk Cancelation System That Uses Adaptive Filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Analysis of a Near-End Crosstalk Cancelation System That Uses Adaptive Filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517339/","volume":"55","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517339/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10346654","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analysis of a Near-End Crosstalk Cancelation System That Uses Adaptive Filters","sourcePdf":"55tcsi10-nongpiur.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06177S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4684845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4684845","articleId":"4517339","onlineDate":"12 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4517376,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Qian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Qian","id":"37535523400"},{"name":"Hoilun Ngan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Hoilun","lastName":"Ngan","id":"37398919800"},{"name":"Yunhao Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yunhao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279413400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3113-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4517376","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Large-scale systems","Radiofrequency identification","RFID tags","Protocols","Delay","Pervasive computing","Computer science","Analytical models","Application software","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardinality estimation","large-scale RFID systems","RFID tags","multiple-reading problem","lottery frame scheme","replicate-insensitive estimation protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RFID Systems","Estimation","Multi-reader"]}],"abstract":"Counting or estimating the number of tags is crucial for large-scale RFID systems. The use of multiple readers was recently proposed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness in reading RFID tags. Due to the long processing time, tag identification based counting schemes are often impractical, especially when tags are attached to moving objects. The existing estimation based schemes, on the other hand, suffer from the multiple-reading problem. To address this issue, we propose the Lottery Frame (LoF) scheme, a replicate-insensitive estimation protocol, that is able to eliminate multiple-readings. We show the high accuracy, short processing time and low overhead of the proposed LoF scheme through analysis and simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cardinality Estimation for Large-scale RFID Systems","publicationTitle":"2008 Sixth Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)","doi":"10.1109/PERCOM.2008.77","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Sixth Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4517340/4517341/04517376.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOM.2008.77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517341","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517376","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cardinality Estimation for Large-scale RFID Systems","conferenceDate":"17-21 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517376/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9977545","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cardinality Estimation for Large-scale RFID Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"3113a030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071315S","chronDate":"17-21 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4517340","isNumber":"4517341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4517340","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"4517341","articleId":"4517376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4517383,"authors":[{"name":"Nattapong Swangmuang","affiliation":["Graduate Program, Telecommunications and Networking, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Nattapong","lastName":"Swangmuang","id":"38094439000"},{"name":"Prashant Krishnamurthy","affiliation":["Graduate Program, Telecommunications and Networking, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Prashant","lastName":"Krishnamurthy","id":"37266317300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3113-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4517383","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":1058},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Performance analysis","Databases","Pervasive computing","Analytical models","Wireless LAN","Euclidean distance","Predictive models","Computational modeling","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile computing","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["location fingerprint analyses","indoor positioning systems","location fingerprinting","fingerprint database","proximity graphs","probability distribution","location estimation"]}],"abstract":"Analytical models to evaluate and predict \"precision\" performance of indoor positioning systems based on location fingerprinting are lacking. Such models can be used to improve the design of positioning systems, for example by eliminating some fingerprints and reducing the size of the location fingerprint database. In this paper, we develop a new analytical model that employs proximity graphs for predicting performance of indoor positioning systems based on location fingerprinting. The model allows computation of an approximate probability distribution of error distance given a location fingerprint database based on received signal strength and its associated statistics. The performance results from the simulation and the analytical model are found to be congruent. This model also allows us to perform analysis of the internal structure of location fingerprints. We employ the analysis of the internal structure to identify and eliminate unnecessary location fingerprints stored in the database, thereby saving on computation while performing location estimation.","doi":"10.1109/PERCOM.2008.33","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Sixth Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4517340/4517341/04517383.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOM.2008.33","publicationTitle":"2008 Sixth Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)","startPage":"100","endPage":"109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location Fingerprint Analyses Toward Efficient Indoor Positioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Location Fingerprint Analyses Toward Efficient Indoor Positioning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517383/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517383/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9977552","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"17-21 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location Fingerprint Analyses Toward Efficient Indoor Positioning","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"3113a100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10826S","chronDate":"17-21 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4517340","isNumber":"4517341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4517340","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4517341","articleId":"4517383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4517391,"authors":[{"name":"Erdin\u00e7 \u00d6zt\u00fcrk","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Erdin\u00e7","lastName":"\u00d6zt\u00fcrk","id":"37722071600"},{"name":"Ghaith Hammouri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ghaith","lastName":"Hammouri","id":"38096344000"},{"name":"Berk Sunar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Berk","lastName":"Sunar","id":"37282907800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3113-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4517391","dbTime":"40 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":620},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Costs","Authentication","Radiofrequency identification","Wireless sensor networks","Public key cryptography","Pervasive computing","Cryptographic protocols","Data security","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","message authentication","telecommunication security","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust low cost authentication","pervasive network","ubiquitous network","cryptography","lightweight challenge response authentication","noisy physical unclonable function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low power authentication","RFIDs","sensor networks","smartcards","physical unclonable functions","tamperproof chips"]}],"abstract":"Low cost devices such as RFIDs, sensor network nodes, and smartcards are crucial for building the next generation pervasive and ubiquitous networks. The inherent power and footprint limitations of such networks, prevent us from employing standard cryptographic techniques for authentication which were originally designed to secure high end systems with abundant power. Furthermore, the sharp increase in the number, diversity and strength of physical attacks which directly target the implementation may have devastating consequences in a network setting creating a single point of failure. A compromised node may leak a master key, or may give the attacker an opportunity for injecting faulty messages. In this paper we present a lightweight challenge response authentication scheme based on noisy physical unclonable functions (PUF) that allows for extremely efficient implementations. Furthermore, the inherent properties of PUFs provide cryptographically strong tamper resilience. In a network setting this means that a tampered device will no longer authenticate and in a sense will be isolated from the network.","doi":"10.1109/PERCOM.2008.54","publicationTitle":"2008 Sixth Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Sixth Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4517340/4517341/04517391.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOM.2008.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517341","startPage":"170","endPage":"178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Robust Low Cost Authentication for Pervasive Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards Robust Low Cost Authentication for Pervasive Devices","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 March 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517391/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-21 March 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9977560","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4517391/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Robust Low Cost Authentication for Pervasive Devices","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"3113a170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126503S","chronDate":"17-21 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4517340","isNumber":"4517341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4517340","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4517341","articleId":"4517391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4517417,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong Fan","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Fan","id":"37273608700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3113-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4517417","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Bandwidth","Interference","Queueing analysis","Fluid flow","System performance","Cognitive radio","Access protocols","Pervasive computing","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","Markov processes","probability","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","dynamic spectrum access networks","DSA wireless networks","secondary users","primary users","spectrum opportunities","ON-OFF distribution","Markov fluid queueing model","bandwidth approximation","packet loss probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dynamic spectrum access","performance models","Markov chain"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","doi":"10.1109/PERCOM.2008.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517341","endPage":"341","publicationTitle":"2008 Sixth Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Sixth Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4517340/4517341/04517417.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOM.2008.13","startPage":"336","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517417","abstract":"In future dynamic spectrum access (DSA) wireless networks, secondary users can make use of spectrum opportunities dynamically for communications.

Efficient and intuitive access, however, remains a considerable challenge. In specifically musical domains, i.e., melody retrieval, query-by-example (QBE) has found considerable success in accessing music that matches a specific query. We propose an extension of the QBE paradigm to the broad class of natural and environmental sounds, which occur frequently in continuous recordings. We explore several cluster-based indexing approaches, namely non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and spectral clustering to efficiently organize and quickly retrieve archived audio using the QBE paradigm. Experiments on a test database compare the performance of the different clustering algorithms in terms of recall, precision, and computational complexity. Initial results indicate significant improvements over both exhaustive search schemes and traditional K- means clustering, and excellent overall performance in the example-based retrieval of environmental sounds.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517532","startPage":"5","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517532.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast query by example of environmental sounds via robust and efficient cluster-based indexing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Fast query by example of environmental sounds via robust and efficient cluster-based indexing","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517532/","accessionNumber":"9972875","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517532/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast query by example of environmental sounds via robust and efficient cluster-based indexing","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062387S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4517539,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Its performance depends to a high degree on the construction of the blocking matrix which produces noise reference signals for the subsequent adaptive interference canceller. Especially in reverberated environments the beamformer may suffer from signal leakage and reduced noise suppression. In this paper a new blocking matrix is proposed. It is based on a generalized eigenvalue problem whose solution provides an indirect estimation of the transfer functions from the source to the sensors. The quality of the new generalized eigenvector blocking matrix is studied in simulated rooms with different reverberation times and is compared to alternatives proposed in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517549","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517549.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"73","endPage":"76","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech enhancement with a new generalized eigenvector blocking matrix for application in a generalized sidelobe canceller","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Speech enhancement with a new generalized eigenvector blocking matrix for application in a generalized sidelobe canceller","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517549/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9972892","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4517549/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech enhancement with a new generalized eigenvector blocking matrix for application in a generalized sidelobe canceller","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035385S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4517552,"authors":[{"name":"Tomohiro Nakatani","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Nakatani","id":"37342222600"},{"name":"Takuya Yoshioka","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuya","lastName":"Yoshioka","id":"37410482600"},{"name":"Keisuke Kinoshita","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Keisuke","lastName":"Kinoshita","id":"37420926300"},{"name":"Masato Miyoshi","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Miyoshi","id":"37283404500"},{"name":"Biing-Hwang Juang","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto, Japan","School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Biing-Hwang","lastName":"Juang","id":"38109154700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4517552","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":2185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Filters","Covariance matrix","Signal processing","Convolution","Speech enhancement","Reverberation","Microphones","Costs","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","reverberation","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind speech dereverberation","multichannel linear prediction","short time Fourier transform","covariance matrix","speech enhancement","signal quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dereverberation","Likelihood maximization","Short time Fourier transform","probabilistic speech model","Inverse filtering"]}],"abstract":"It has recently been shown that the use of the time-varying nature of speech signals allows us to achieve high quality speech dereverberation based on multi-channel linear prediction (MCLP).

and inharmonic Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Polyphonic Pitch transcription","abstract":"Polyphonic pitch transcription consists of estimating the onset time, duration and pitch of each note in a music signal. This task is difficult in general, due to the wide range of possible instruments. This issue has been studied using adaptive models such as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), which describe the signal as a weighted sum of basis spectra. However basis spectra representing multiple pitches result in inaccurate transcription. To avoid this, we propose a family of constrained NMF models, where each basis spectrum is expressed as a weighted sum of narrowband spectra consisting of a few adjacent partials at harmonic or inharmonic frequencies. The model parameters are adapted via combined multiplicative and Newton updates. The proposed method is shown to outperform standard NMF on a database of piano excerpts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9972901","htmlLink":"/document/4517558/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Harmonic and inharmonic Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Polyphonic Pitch transcription","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic and inharmonic Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Polyphonic Pitch transcription","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056202S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4517568,"authors":[{"name":"Hirofumi Nakajima","affiliation":["Honda Research Institute Japan Company Limited, Wako, Saitama, Japan"],"lastName":"Hirofumi Nakajima","id":"37555790500"},{"name":"Kazuhiro Nakadai","affiliation":["Honda Research Institute Japan Company Limited, Wako, Saitama, Japan"],"lastName":"Kazuhiro Nakadai","id":"37274046900"},{"name":"Yuji Hasegawa","affiliation":["Honda Research Institute Japan Company Limited, Wako, Saitama, Japan"],"lastName":"Yuji Hasegawa","id":"37288141700"},{"name":"Hiroshi Tsujino","affiliation":["Honda Research Institute Japan Company Limited, Wako, Saitama, Japan"],"lastName":"Hiroshi Tsujino","id":"37274048200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4517568","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":247},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Blind source separation","Source separation","Microphone arrays","Robots","Acoustic noise","Working environment noise","Newton method","Speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","adaptive control","blind source separation","matrix algebra","Newton method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive step-size parameter control","real-world blind source separation","separation matrix","sound source","robot audition systems","fixed step-size parameter","adaptive step-size control","Newton method","complex gradient theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["robot audition","blind source separation","adaptive step-size","Newton\u2019s method"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a method to adaptively control a step-size parameter which is used for updating a separation matrix to extract a target sound source accurately in blind source separation (BSS). The design of the step-size parameter is essential when we apply BSS to real-world applications such as robot audition systems, because the surrounding environment dynamically changes in the real world. It is common to use a fixed step-size parameter that is obtained empirically. However, due to environmental changes and noises, the performance of BSS with the fixed step-size parameter deteriorates and the separation matrix sometimes diverges. We propose a general method that allows adaptive step-size control. The proposed method is an extension of Newton's method utilizing a complex gradient theory and is applicable to any BSS algorithm. Actually, we applied it to six types of BSS algorithms for an 8ch microphone array embedded in Honda ASIMO. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the performance of these six BSS algorithms through experiments of separation and recognition for two simultaneous speeches.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517568","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517568.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"149","endPage":"152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive step-size parameter control for real-world blind source separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517568","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive step-size parameter control for real-world blind source separation","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517568/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9972911","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4517568/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive step-size parameter control for real-world blind source separation","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048887S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4517569,"authors":[{"name":"Kleanthis N.

In order to focus on estimation performance, perfect resolution of the permutation ambiguity is assumed. Simulations under varying reverberation conditions and comparison with previous estimation methods that are widely used in BSS problems demonstrate significant performance gains.

In the proposed system, multichannel acoustic signals captured at the distant microphones are encoded to a set of location/signal pairs of virtual sound sources based on frequency-domain ICA. After estimating the locations and the signals of the virtual sources, by convolving the controlled acoustic transfer functions with each signal, the spatial sound at the selected point is constructed. In the evaluation, the sound field made by 6 sound sources is captured using 48 distant microphones and is encoded into set of virtual sound sources. Subjective evaluation shows that there is no significant difference between natural and reconstructed sound when more than 6 virtual sources are used. Therefore the effectiveness of the encoding algorithm as well as the virtual source representation is confirmed.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517576","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517576.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"181","endPage":"184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Encoding large array signals into a 3D sound field representation for selective listening point audio based on blind source separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Encoding large array signals into a 3D sound field representation for selective listening point audio based on blind source separation","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517576/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9972919","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4517576/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Encoding large array signals into a 3D sound field representation for selective listening point audio based on blind source separation","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054627S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4517587,"authors":[{"name":"David Varodayan","affiliation":["Information Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Varodayan","id":"37297703600"},{"name":"Yao-Chung Lin","affiliation":["Information Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yao-Chung Lin","id":"37578091700"},{"name":"Bernd Girod","affiliation":["Information Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Girod","id":"37283315200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4517587","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Source coding","Watermarking","Peer to peer computing","Decoding","Bit rate","Encoding","Cryptography","Digital signatures","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio coding","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed source coding","content delivery","untrusted intermediaries","malicious tampering","backward-compatible audio authentication","Slepian-Wolf encoded quantized perceptually significant audio projection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Audio authentication","distributed source coding","LDPC codes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517587","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517587","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","abstract":"Audio authentication is important in content delivery via untrusted intermediaries, for example peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing. Many differently encoded versions of the original audio might exist. Distinguishing the legitimate diversity of encodings from malicious tampering is the challenge addressed in this paper. We develop an approach based on distributed source coding for the problem of backward-compatible audio authentication. The key idea is to provide a Slepian-Wolf encoded quantized perceptually significant audio projection as authentication data.

These VSS methods are so effective, they eliminate the need for a separate double-talk detection algorithm in echo cancellation applications. The key feature of both approaches is the introduction of a new near-end signal energy estimator (NESEE) that provides accurate and computationally efficient estimates even during double-talk and echo path change events. The first VSS algorithm applies the NESEE to the recently proposed Nonparametric VSS NLMS (NPVSS-NLMS) algorithm. The resulting algorithm has excellent convergence characteristics with an intrinsic immunity to double-talk. The second approach is somewhat more ad hoc. It is composed of a combination of an efficient echo path change detector and the NESEE. This VSS method also has excellent convergence, double talk immunity, and computational efficiency. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of both proposed algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517591.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"244","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel variable step size nlms algorithms for echo cancellation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Echo cancellers","Signal processing algorithms","Variable structure systems","Change detection algorithms","Adaptive filters","Convergence","Acoustic signal detection","Detectors","Automatic control","Adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","adaptive filters","convergence","echo suppression","least mean squares methods","state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable step size","NLMS algorithms","normalized least mean square","acoustic echo cancellation","adaptive filters","double-talk detection algorithm","near-end signal energy estimator","nonparametric VSS NLMS algorithm","convergence","double talk immunity","computational efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Double-talk detection","acoustic echo canceller","echo path change detection","and AEC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Novel variable step size nlms algorithms for echo cancellation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517591/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9972934","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel variable step size nlms algorithms for echo cancellation","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045714S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4517601,"authors":[{"name":"Boaz Rafaely","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"firstName":"Boaz","lastName":"Rafaely","id":"37283159800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4517601","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":374},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517601","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphone arrays","Array signal processing","Optical reflection","Power harmonic filters","Acoustic applications","Fourier transforms","Sampling methods","Null value","Acoustic reflection","Acoustic measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","array signal processing","microphone arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spherical microphone array","directional room impulse responses","multiple-null spherical array processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microphone array","spherical harmonics","room acoustics","beamforming","null-steering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517601","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517601.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spherical microphone array with multiple nulls for analysis of directional room impulse responses","abstract":"A spherical microphone array is presented which incorporates multiple nulls in the beampattern for analysis of directional room impulse responses.

This causes problems for source localisation and tracking since reverberation generates spurious peaks in the time delay functions, and makes the subsequent location estimator hard to track the motion trajectory. Previous time delay based tracking methods, such as the extended Kalman filter and the particle filter, are sensitive to reverberation and are unable to follow sharp changes in the source positions. In this paper, the extended Kalman filter and the particle filter are combined to solve this problem. One of the advantages of this approach is that the optimal importance function can be obtained after extended Kalman filtering. Thus, the position samples are distributed in a more accurate area than using a prior importance function. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the sequential importance resampling particle filter by reducing the estimation error and following the switch of speakers quickly under a moderate reverberant environment (reverberation time T\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">60</inf>\n \u226a 0.3s).","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"293","endPage":"296","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517604.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517604","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle tracking","Kalman filters","Particle filters","Reverberation","Delay effects","Switches","Loudspeakers","Delay estimation","Motion estimation","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","reverberation","speech processing","tracking filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonconcurrent multiple speakers tracking","extended Kalman particle filter","Acoustic reverberation","multipath components","audio signal","source signal statistical properties","source localisation","source tracking","time delay functions","location estimator","motion trajectory","estimation error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["source tracking","reverberation","particle filter","extended Kalman filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nonconcurrent multiple speakers tracking based on extended Kalman particle filter","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9972947","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4517604/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517604/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonconcurrent multiple speakers tracking based on extended Kalman particle filter","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043009S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4517607,"authors":[{"name":"Ville Myllyla","affiliation":["Nokia Technology Platforms, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Ville","lastName":"Myllyla","id":"37944975000"},{"name":"Matti Hamalainen","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Hamalainen","id":"37265955900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4517607","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":371},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphone arrays","Array signal processing","Adaptive arrays","Beam steering","Echo cancellers","Teleconferencing","Loudspeakers","Niobium","Interference cancellation","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic filters","acoustic signal processing","array signal processing","echo","echo suppression","integration","microphone arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive beamforming methods","dynamically steered microphone array SYSTEMS","steered beamforming filter","acoustic echo cancellation","adaptive generalized sidelobe canceler","steering independent AEC processing methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","Beam steering","Adaptive Echo Cancellation","Adaptive Interference Cancellation","Polynomial Beamforming Filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517607","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517607","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","abstract":"This paper introduces two methods for the integration of a dynamically steered beamforming filter with acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) and adaptive generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC) based beamforming methods.

In the case of discriminating two classes of signals, EEG signals are projected onto a space where one class of signals is maximally scattered and the other is minimally scattered. This paper finds a minimal number of electrodes that can achieve the discrimination. Applying many electrodes is tedious and time-consuming. To reduce the number of electrodes, we propose inducing sparsity in the spatial filter. We reformulate the optimization problem in Common Spatial Patterns by introducing an ^i-norm regularization term. Experimental results on five subjects show that the proposed method significantly reduces the number of electrodes while generating features with good discriminatory information. The number of electrodes on average, is reduced to 11% (of the 118 electrodes) while the average drop in the classification accuracy is only 3.8%.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517635","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517635.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"417","endPage":"420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse spatial filter optimization for EEG channel reduction in brain-computer interface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sparse spatial filter optimization for EEG channel reduction in brain-computer interface","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517635/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9972978","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4517635/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse spatial filter optimization for EEG channel reduction in brain-computer interface","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095833S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4517676,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Typically, each microarray spot contains a large number of copies of a single probe designed to capture a single target, and hence collects only a single data point. This is a wasteful use of the sensing resources in comparative DNA microarray experiments, where a test sample is measured relative to a reference sample. Since only a small fraction of the total number of genes represented by the two samples is differentially expressed, a vast number of probe spots will not provide any useful information. To this end we consider an alternative design, the so-called compressed microarrays, wherein each spot is a composite of several different probes and the total number of spots is potentially much smaller than the number of targets being tested. Fewer spots directly translates to significantly lower costs due to cheaper array manufacturing, simpler image acquisition and processing, and smaller amount of genomic material needed for experiments. To recover signals from compressed microarray measurements, we leverage ideas from compressive sampling. Moreover, we propose an algorithm which has far less computational complexity than the widely-used linear-programming-based methods, and can also recover signals with less sparsity.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517676","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517676.pdf","startPage":"581","endPage":"584","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse measurements, compressed sampling, and DNA microarrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Sparse measurements, compressed sampling, and DNA microarrays","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4517676/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973019","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517676/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse measurements, compressed sampling, and DNA microarrays","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051409S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4517684,"authors":[{"name":"Rajet Krishnan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, USA"],"firstName":"Rajet","lastName":"Krishnan","id":"37393338600"},{"name":"Balasubramaniam Natarajan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas"],"firstName":"Balasubramaniam","lastName":"Natarajan","id":"37278060200"},{"name":"Steve Warren","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, USA"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Warren","id":"37313928100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4517684","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":699},"abstract":"In this work, we present novel methods for detecting the presence of motion artifact in photoplethysmographic (PPG) measurements based on higher order statistical information present in the data.

In the frequency domain, the presence of random components due to motion artifact is analyzed using a frequency domain kurtosis measure. Additionally, bispectral analysis of PPG data indicates the presence of strong quadratic phase coupling (QPC) and more specifically self coupling in the case of clean PPG data. Though quadratic phase coupling is found in data corrupted by motion artifact, the self coupling feature is absent. A Neyman-Pearson (NP) detection rule is formulated for each of the measures. Additionally, treating each of the measures as observations from independent sensors, the Varshney-Chair rule is used to fuse individual decisions to form a global system decision.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517684.pdf","startPage":"613","endPage":"616","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and detection of motion artifact in photoplethysmographic data using higher order statistics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion detection","Motion analysis","Higher order statistics","Frequency domain analysis","Motion measurement","Data analysis","Time measurement","Frequency measurement","Sensor fusion","Sensor systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical signal detection","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion artifact","photoplethysmographic data","higher order statistics","photoplethysmographic measurements","time domain","skew measure","kurtosis measure","motion corrupted data","Neyman-Pearson detection rule","Varshney-Chair rule","global system decision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Higher Order Statistics (HOS)","Quadratic Phase Coupling (QPC)","Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and detection of motion artifact in photoplethysmographic data using higher order statistics","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517684/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973027","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and detection of motion artifact in photoplethysmographic data using higher order statistics","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061159S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4517731,"authors":[{"name":"Tarik Arici","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Tarik","lastName":"Arici","id":"37277887200"},{"name":"Elif Albuz","affiliation":["Video Software Architecture Group, NVIDIA Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Elif","lastName":"Albuz","id":"37372931400"},{"name":"Yucel Altunbasak","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Yucel","lastName":"Altunbasak","id":"37280949500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4517731","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Hardware","Brightness","Computational complexity","Bayesian methods","Testing","Noise reduction","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational modeling","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonspatial prior information","block matching based motion estimation","Bayesian approach","hypothesis testing","motion vector likelihood","pixel data","posterior distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Motion estimation","block matching","prior motion information"]}],"abstract":"Due to memory bandwidth limitations and computational complexity considerations in hardware implementations, block matching combined with lscr\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n error norm and translational motion model is preferred in motion-estimation algorithms.

The basic idea of this theory is that when the signal of interest is very sparse (i.e., zero-valued at most locations) or compressible, relatively few incoherent observations are necessary to reconstruct the most significant non-zero signal components. However, applying this theory to practical imaging systems is challenging in the face of several measurement system constraints. This paper describes the design of coded aperture masks for super- resolution image reconstruction from a single, low-resolution, noisy observation image.

It is shown that the region-selective design is highly beneficial for the considered objective image quality metrics, in particular, prediction accuracy can be significantly increased.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517748","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517748.pdf","startPage":"869","endPage":"872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regional attention to structural degradations for perceptual image quality metric design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Regional attention to structural degradations for perceptual image quality metric design","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973091","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517748/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regional attention to structural degradations for perceptual image quality metric design","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038068S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4517759,"authors":[{"name":"Fabrizio Argenti","affiliation":["Dipartimento Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 di Firenze, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Argenti","id":"37266590100"},{"name":"Tiziano Bianchi","affiliation":["Dipartimento Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 di Firenze, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Tiziano","lastName":"Bianchi","id":"37269910100"},{"name":"Giovanni Martucci di Scarfizzi","affiliation":["Dipartimento Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 di Firenze, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni Martucci","lastName":"di Scarfizzi","id":"38093287500"},{"name":"Luciano Alparone","affiliation":["Dipartimento Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 di Firenze, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Alparone","id":"37272265700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4517759","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image restoration","Filter bank","Signal resolution","Signal restoration","Wavelet domain","Wavelet transforms","Mean square error methods","Matrix decomposition","Telecommunications","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","image resolution","image restoration","maximum likelihood estimation","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image restoration","multiplicative noise","nonsubsampled contourlet domain","directional representation","SAR images","wavelet transform","maximum-a-posteriori","linear minimum mean square error criterion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiplicative noise","image denoising","nonsubsampled contourlet transform","MMSE filter","MAP filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517759","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517759.pdf","startPage":"913","endPage":"916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Restoration of images corrupted by multiplicative noise in the nonsubsampled contourlet domain","abstract":"The nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) is a powerful and versatile tool that allows a multiresolution and directional representation to be achieved.

The proposed extension of causal multi-dimensional HMMs allows state transitions in arbitrary causal directions and neighbors. We subsequently generalize this framework further to non-causal models by distributing the non-causal models into multiple causal multi-dimensional HMMs. The proposed training and classification process consists of the extension of three fundamental algorithms to multi-dimensional causal systems, i.e. (1) expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm; (2) general forward-backward (GFB) algorithm; and (3) Viterbi algorithm. Simulation results performed using real-world images and videos demonstrate the superior performance, higher accuracy rate and promising applicability of the proposed DHMM framework.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed multi-dimensional hidden Markov models for image and trajectory-based video classifications","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517770","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517770.pdf","startPage":"957","endPage":"960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed multi-dimensional hidden Markov models for image and trajectory-based video classifications","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517770/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973113","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed multi-dimensional hidden Markov models for image and trajectory-based video classifications","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039612S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4517772,"authors":[{"name":"Zheshen Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Zheshen Wang","id":"37404922100"},{"name":"Baoxin Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Baoxin Li","id":"37292487900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4517772","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Psychology","Humans","Visual system","Colored noise","Coherence","Cognition","Visual perception","Computer science","Image processing","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human vision","saliency detection","spectrum residual model","visual pop-outs","coherence based propagation","image processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image Processing","Image Analysis","Object detection","Pattern Recognition"]}],"abstract":"Researches in psychology, perception and related fields show that there may be a two-stage process involved in human vision.

Video coding consumes a significant amount of this limited system memory bandwidth especially at high-definition (HD) resolution. Techniques that reduce memory bandwidth in video coding are crucial for implementing video coding at HD resolutions in portable video devices. Memory bandwidth reduction is also desirable from a power consumption point of view since memory accesses consume a significant amount of power.

Then, based on a pre-selected spatial- domain method, we formulate an optimization problem for finding an LTDS to approximate the given spatial domain method for achieving the best trade-off between the visual quality and the complexity. By selecting a spatial-domain reference method with the popular Butterworth lowpass filtering and bicubic interpolation, the proposed framework discovers LTDSs with better visual quality and lower computational complexity as saving 20%~70% execution time when compared with state-of-the-art methods in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517875","startPage":"1377","endPage":"1380","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517875.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Down-sampling in DCT domain using linear transform with double-sided multiplication for image/video transcoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Down-sampling in DCT domain using linear transform with double-sided multiplication for image/video transcoding","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517875/","accessionNumber":"9973217","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517875/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Down-sampling in DCT domain using linear transform with double-sided multiplication for image/video transcoding","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049856S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4517881,"authors":[{"name":"Ruben Bartholoma","affiliation":["Department Engineering and Information Technology, Pforzheim University, Pforzheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Ruben","lastName":"Bartholoma","id":"37424294400"},{"name":"Thomas Greiner","affiliation":["Department Engineering and Information Technology, Pforzheim University, Pforzheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Greiner","id":"37417253100"},{"name":"Frank Kesel","affiliation":["Department Engineering and Information Technology, Pforzheim University, Pforzheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Kesel","id":"37424295300"},{"name":"Wolfgang Rosenstiel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of T\u00fcbingen, Tubingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Rosenstiel","id":"37267029700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4517881","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Filter bank","Discrete cosine transforms","Design methodology","Discrete wavelet transforms","Throughput","Computer architecture","Finite impulse response filter","Channel bank filters","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","VLSI","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic synthesis","VLSI architectures","arbitrary lifting-based filter banks","discrete cosine transforms","fixed data throughput","resource consumption","system-on-chip design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design methodology","Very-large-scale integration","Lifting scheme","Wavelet transforms","Discrete cosine transforms"]}],"abstract":"Recently, the conventional lifting scheme that is widely used for the construction of wavelets and 2-channel filter banks has been extended to M-channel filter banks (M > 2). This extension brings up the beneficial properties of the lifting scheme to a broader range of applications, like discrete cosine transforms. There exist many hand-crafted lifting-based VLSI architectures, which mostly concentrate on a single and specific target application having a fixed data throughput and resource consumption. However, the reusability of such architectures is limited due to the lack of scalability and flexibility. To overcome this issue, we present a novel design methodology for automatic synthesis of VLSI architectures that are suitable for arbitrary lifting-based M-channel filter banks and transforms. The methodology offers wide-ranging design space exploration with varying resource consumption and data throughput tradeoffs, as it is desired in modern system-on-chip design.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517881","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517881.pdf","startPage":"1401","endPage":"1404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic synthesis of VLSI architectures for arbitrary lifting-based filter banks and transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517881/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic synthesis of VLSI architectures for arbitrary lifting-based filter banks and transforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973223","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517881/","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic synthesis of VLSI architectures for arbitrary lifting-based filter banks and transforms","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04643S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4517884,"authors":[{"name":"Hojin Kee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Hojin","lastName":"Kee","id":"37597126500"},{"name":"Newton Petersen","affiliation":["National Instruments Corporation, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Newton","lastName":"Petersen","id":"37271965800"},{"name":"Jacob Kornerup","affiliation":["National Instruments Corporation, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Kornerup","id":"37593858300"},{"name":"Shuvra S.

Our approach considers both cost (in terms of FPGA resource requirements), and performance (in terms of throughput), and optimizes for both of these dimensions based on user-specified requirements. Our approach involves two orthogonal techniques-FFT inner loop unrolling and outer loop unrolling - to perform design space exploration in terms of cost and performance. By appropriately combining these two forms unrolling, we can achieve cost-optimized FFT implementations in terms of FPGA slices or block RAMs in FPGA, subject to the required throughput. We compared the results of our synthesis approach with a recently-introduced commercial FPGA intellectual property (IP) core - the FFT IP module in the Xilinx LogiCore Library, which provides different FFT implementations that are optimized for a limited set of performance levels. Our results demonstrate efficiency levels that are in some cases better than these commercial IP blocks. At the same time, our approach provides the advantages of being able to optimize implementations based on arbitrary, user-specified performance levels, and of being based on general formulations of FFT loop unrolling trade-offs, which can be retargeted to different kinds of FPGA devices.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517884","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517884.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"1413","endPage":"1416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic generation of FPGA-based FFT implementations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Systematic generation of FPGA-based FFT implementations","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517884/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973226","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4517884/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic generation of FPGA-based FFT implementations","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034646S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4517885,"authors":[{"name":"Lanping Deng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA"],"firstName":"Lanping","lastName":"Deng","id":"37306005500"},{"name":"Kanwaldeep Sobti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA"],"firstName":"Kanwaldeep","lastName":"Sobti","id":"37313167100"},{"name":"Chaitali Chakrabarti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA"],"firstName":"Chaitali","lastName":"Chakrabarti","id":"37271330900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4517885","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":429},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Mathematical model","Power system modeling","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Energy consumption","Table lookup","State estimation","Logic","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curve fitting","estimation theory","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","low-power electronics","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","power estimation model","area estimation model","Xilinx Virtex-2Pro family","design space exploration","automated algorithm-architecture codesign framework","regression analysis","curve fitting","fixed point IP core","block RAM","multiplier","floating-point IP core"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["area and power models","FPGA implementation","IP core","regression analysis"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents accurate area and power estimation models for implementations using FPGAs from the Xilinx Virtex-2Pro family.

Also, the presented principles can be applied on any customizable processor architectures to accelerate QR decomposition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex-valued QR decomposition implementation for MIMO receivers","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517889","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517889.pdf","startPage":"1433","endPage":"1436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517889/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Complex-valued QR decomposition implementation for MIMO receivers","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517889/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973231","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex-valued QR decomposition implementation for MIMO receivers","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053777S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4517891,"authors":[{"name":"Massimo Rovini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Rovini","id":"37394768200"},{"name":"Fabio Principe","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Principe","id":"37546010400"},{"name":"Luca Fanucci","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Fanucci","id":"37265849900"},{"name":"Marco Luise","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Luise","id":"37271165400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4517891","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of message-passing algorithms for the acquisition of spreading codes","abstract":"A new technique to acquire pseudo-noise (PN) sequences has been recently proposed in [1] and [2].

Our aim is to provide a single chip solution for baseband processing of WiMAX PHY. The data throughput should achieve 20 Mbps both for uplink and downlink. The solution is implemented on cell broadband engine, which is a multicore processor jointly developed by IBM, SONY and Toshiba for high performance computing(HPC).

Thereafter those modulated filter banks are applied to a speech separation system which extracts a target speech signal. In our system, speech signals are first transformed into the subband domain with our filter banks, and the subband components are then processed with a beamforming algorithm. Following beamforming, post-filtering and binary masking are further performed to remove residual noises. We show that our filter banks can suppress the residual aliasing distortion more than conventional ones. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our design techniques through a set of automatic speech recognition experiments on the multi-channel speech data from the PASCAL Speech Separation Challenge. The experimental results prove that our beamforming system with the proposed filter banks achieves the best recognition performance, a 39.6 % word error rate (WER), with half the amount of computation of that of the conventional filter banks while the perfect reconstruction filter banks provided a 44.4 % WER.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517933.pdf","startPage":"1609","endPage":"1612","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filter bank design based on minimization of individual aliasing terms for minimum mutual information subband adaptive beamforming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Mutual information","Array signal processing","Prototypes","Design methodology","Signal synthesis","Speech synthesis","Speech processing","Signal processing","Automatic speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","channel bank filters","interference suppression","speech processing","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulated filter bank design","minimum mutual information subband adaptive beamforming","individual aliasing term minimization","speech separation system","target speech signal extraction","binary masking","residual noise removal","automatic speech recognition","Nyquist filters","subband domain","post-filtering","PASCAL Speech Separation Challenge","multichannel speech data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["filter bank design","subband processing","beamforming","speech recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Filter bank design based on minimization of individual aliasing terms for minimum mutual information subband adaptive beamforming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517933/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973275","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filter bank design based on minimization of individual aliasing terms for minimum mutual information subband adaptive beamforming","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054308S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4517936,"authors":[{"name":"Darren F.

Typically, vibration signals are acquired through contact with the machine and used for monitoring. In this paper, a novel implementation of the ubiquitous feature extraction approach Envelope Analysis (EA) is applied to acoustic noise signals (< 25 kHz) to predict the RUL of a rotating machine. A well known drawback of the EA approach is that the frequency band of interest must be known or pre-estimated. Therefore, this approach is compared to a Data-Driven approach to feature extraction which utilizes an Information Theoretic approach to feature selection that does not require any a-priori information regarding the frequency band of interest. It is shown that the Data- Driven approach, with an accuracy of 97.7%, significantly outperforms the EA approach, with an accuracy of 93.7%. This study also shows that the improved performance of the Data-Driven approach is due to new information being uncovered in spectral locations across the entire spectrum from 0 to 25 kHz, and not just within one frequency band typically used by the EA approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4517936/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973278","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Envelope analysis and data-driven approaches to acoustic feature extraction for predicting the remaining useful life of rotating machinery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Envelope analysis and data-driven approaches to acoustic feature extraction for predicting the remaining useful life of rotating machinery","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041033S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":4517946,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenhua Qu","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of Information Security Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhenhua","lastName":"Qu","id":"37692413000"},{"name":"Weiqi Luo","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of Information Security Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Weiqi","lastName":"Luo","id":"37399629400"},{"name":"Jiwu Huang","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of Information Security Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiwu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37281263600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4517946","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":371},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4517946","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transform coding","Image coding","Authentication","Independent component analysis","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Image segmentation","Blind source separation","Source separation","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","convolution","image classification","image coding","image segmentation","independent component analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutive mixing model","shifted double JPEG compression","passive image authentication","block segmentation","blind source separation","noise free condition","independent component analysis","ICA method","independent value map","support vector machine","SVM classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image Forgery","Shifted Double JPEG","Convolutive Mixing Model","ICA","Image Authentication"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517946","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04517946.pdf","startPage":"1661","endPage":"1664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A convolutive mixing model for shifted double JPEG compression with application to passive image authentication","abstract":"The artifacts by JPEG recompression have been demonstrated to be useful in passive image authentication. In this paper, we focus on the shifted double JPEG problem, aiming at identifying if a given JPEG image has ever been compressed twice with inconsistent block segmentation. We formulated the shifted double JPEG compression (SD-JPEG) as a noisy convolutive mixing model mostly studied in blind source separation (BSS). In noise free condition, the model can be solved by directly applying the independent component analysis (ICA) method with minor constraint to the contents of natural images. In order to achieve robust identification in noisy condition, the asymmetry of the independent value map (IVM) is exploited to obtain a normalized criteria of the independency. We generate a total of 13 features to fully represent the asymmetric characteristic of the independent value map and then feed to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Experiment results on a set of 1000 images, with various parameter settings, demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4517946/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9973288","publicationDate":"March 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4517946/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A convolutive mixing model for shifted double JPEG compression with application to passive image authentication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A convolutive mixing model for shifted double JPEG compression with application to passive image authentication","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059246S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4517946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4517966,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Khademi Kalantari","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Nima Khademi","lastName":"Kalantari","id":"37400011400"},{"name":"Seyed Mohammad Ahadi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Mohammad","lastName":"Ahadi","id":"37265110300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4517966","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vector quantization","Modulation coding","Watermarking","Decoding","Robustness","Computational complexity","Digital modulation","Humans","Auditory system","Digital audio players"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","low-pass filters","orthogonal codes","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital watermarking","concentric hyperspherical codebooks","vector quantization index modulation","orthogonal code","audio watermarking","human auditory system","MP3 compression","low-pass filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vector Quantization Index Modulation","hyperspherical codebooks","decoder optimization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a digital watermarking system based on vector quantization is presented.

A generative model based on hidden Markov model (HMM) is derived to track the nonstationarity of the source signal while the source signal itself is modeled by temporally correlated generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) model. The maximum likelihood (ML) approach is developed to estimate the parameters of the proposed model by using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and the source signals are estimated by maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach. The strength of the proposed approach lies in the tracking of the nonstationarity of the source signal by HMM and the temporal correlation by the autoregressive (AR) source model.

network for 2D object classification","abstract":"In this paper, a wavelet neural network (WNN)-based approach for invariant 2D object classification is proposed. The method employs the WNN characterizing the singularities of the object curvature representation and performing the classification at the same time and in an automatic way. The discriminative time-frequency attributes of the singularities on the object boundary are firstly captured by the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and then stored by the WNN as its initial scale-translation parameters. These parameters are trained to the optimum status during the learning stage. Thus, only a few convolutions at the optimum scale-translation grids are involved during the classification, which makes our method suitable for real-time recognition tasks. Compared with the artificial neural network (ANN)-based approach preceded by a wavelet filter bank with fixed scale-translation parameters as well as the traditional methods like Fourier descriptors and moment invariants, our scheme demonstrates the best discrimination performance under various noisy and affine conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518022/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9973364","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518022/","publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Wavelet neural network for 2D object classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet neural network for 2D object classification","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059728S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4518026,"authors":[{"name":"Frederic Thouin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Computer Engineering, McGill University, Canada"],"firstName":"Frederic","lastName":"Thouin","id":"37296925700"},{"name":"Mark Coates","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Computer Engineering, McGill University, Canada"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Coates","id":"37284672500"},{"name":"Brian Erikkson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Erikkson","id":"38096674200"},{"name":"Robert Nowak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Nowak","id":"37265271600"},{"name":"Clayton Scott","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Clayton","lastName":"Scott","id":"37276943500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518026","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Stochastic processes","Statistical learning","Machine learning","Probability","Support vector machine classification","Application software","Machine learning algorithms","Statistics","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computability","constraint handling","learning (artificial intelligence)","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning satisfiability","label constraint","response constraint","LSAT problem","support vector machine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine Learning","Satisfiability","SVM","Minimum Volume Sets","One-class Neighbor Machines"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518026","abstract":"This paper investigates a class of learning problems called learning satisfiability (LSAT) problems, where the goal is to learn a set in the input (feature) space that satisfies a number of desired output (label/response) constraints. LSAT problems naturally arise in many applications in which one is interested in the class of inputs that produce desirable outputs, rather than simply a single optimum. A distinctive aspect of LSAT problems is that the output behavior is assessed only on the solution set, whereas in most statistical learning problems output behavior is evaluated over the entire input space. We present a novel support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for solving LSAT problems and apply it to a synthetic data set to illustrate the impact of the LSAT formulation.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518026","startPage":"1981","endPage":"1984","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518026.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to satisfy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Learning to satisfy","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518026/","accessionNumber":"9973368","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518026/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to satisfy","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073884S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518028,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro A.

Temporal correlation in sequences often causes difficulty in applying feature selection tech niques. Inspired by segmental k-means segmentation (SKS) [B. Juang and L. Rabiner, 1990], we propose Segmentally Boosted HMMs (SBHMMs), where the state-optimized features are constructed in a segmental and discriminative manner. The contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a novel feature selection algorithm, where the temporal dynamics are decoupled from the static learning procedure by assuming that the sequential data are piecewise independent and identically distributed. Second, we show that the SBHMM consistently improves traditional HMM recognition in various domains. The reduction of error compared to traditional HMMs ranges from 17% to 70% in American Sign Language recognition, human gait identification, lip reading, and speech recognition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminative feature selection for hidden Markov models using Segmental Boosting","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518031","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518031.pdf","startPage":"2001","endPage":"2004","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Discriminative feature selection for hidden Markov models using Segmental Boosting","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518031/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973373","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative feature selection for hidden Markov models using Segmental Boosting","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066846S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4518043,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaomeng Shi","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaomeng Shi","id":"37401244600"},{"name":"Desmond S.

Base-calling on the major alone yields accuracy commensurate with single sequence approaches, and joint base-calling provides results for the minor which, while being of lesser quality, incurs no additional cost and can be ultimately used in the genome assembly process.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint base-calling of two DNA sequences with factor graphs","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518043","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518043.pdf","startPage":"2049","endPage":"2052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Joint base-calling of two DNA sequences with factor graphs","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518043/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973385","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint base-calling of two DNA sequences with factor graphs","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00522.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058627S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4518049,"authors":[{"name":"Lifeng Lai","affiliation":["Department of Elec.

In the scenario under consideration, the availability probability of each channel is unknown a priori to the cognitive user. Hence efficient medium access strategies must strike a balance between exploring the availability of channels and exploiting the opportunities identified thus far. Using a sequential design approach, an optimal medium access strategy is derived. To avoid the prohibitive computational complexity of this optimal strategy, a low complexity asymptotically optimal strategy is also developed. The proposed strategy does not require any prior statistical knowledge about the traffic pattern on the different channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9973391","htmlLink":"/document/4518049/","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal medium access control in cognitive radios: A sequential design approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal medium access control in cognitive radios: A sequential design approach","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00528.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053925S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518052,"authors":[{"name":"Michael R.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid-forwarding P2P VoD architecture, which integrates both the buffer-forwarding approach and storage-forwarding approach.

The jammer's interference introduces correlation across receivers and destroys the decomposable form of the maximum-likelihood decoder, thus preventing direct application of known distributed detection algorithms. This paper develops distributed detectors that circumvent this problem. Treating the jammer signal as deterministic, we develop two distributed estimation-decoding algorithms. The first algorithm relies on the generalized likelihood ratio test, whereas the second algorithm relies on semi-definite relaxation techniques and is suitable for large alphabet sizes. Both algorithms feature: (i) distributed implementation requiring only single-hop communications; (ii) no constraints on the network topology so long as it is connected; and (iii) performance close to the optimum centralized detector in the presence of severe jamming.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518095","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518095.pdf","startPage":"2257","endPage":"2260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anti-jam distributed MIMO decoding using wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518095/","displayDocTitle":"Anti-jam distributed MIMO decoding using wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973437","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518095/","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anti-jam distributed MIMO decoding using wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00574.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075831S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518108,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Yang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chun-Yang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293085800"},{"name":"P.

Unlike the traditional SIMO (single-input multiple-output) radar, which transmits scaled versions of a single waveform in the antenna elements, the MIMO radar transmits independent waveforms in each of the antenna elements. It has been shown that MIMO radar systems have many advantages such as high spatial resolution, improved parameter identifiability, and enhanced flexibility for transmit beampattern design. In the traditional SIMO radar, the range and Doppler resolutions can be characterized by the radar ambiguity function. It is a major tool for studying and analyzing radar signals. Recently, the ambiguity function has been extended to the MIMO radar case. In this paper, some mathematical properties of the MIMO radar ambiguity function are derived. These properties provide insights into the MIMO radar waveform design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Properties of the MIMO radar ambiguity function","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518108","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518108.pdf","startPage":"2309","endPage":"2312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Properties of the MIMO radar ambiguity function","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518108/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973450","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Properties of the MIMO radar ambiguity function","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00587.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041209S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4518109,"authors":[{"name":"Vito F.

This permits separation and coherent recombination of transmit beams to form virtual transmit nulls in directions that would otherwise result in multipath clutter returns in the receive mainlobe.

Optimal design of the transmit beamformer(s) from a quality of service perspective is a hard computational problem; however, convex approximation tools have been shown to yield high-quality approximate solutions. Recently, Lozano proposed a particularly simple adaptive multicast beamforming algorithm that aims to serve a certain percentage of users. In parallel, convex approximation algorithms were developed for the more general problem of joint co-channel multicast beamforming and admission control. In this paper, we focus on the important (in view of recent standardization activity) special case of a single multicast group, and put the two approaches to the test. Through simple examples, we pinpoint issues regarding convergence of Lozano's algorithm. In numerical experiments with measured channel data, we show that a convex approximation approach is preferable performance- wise. At the same time, we find merits in the simplicity of Lozano's approach, and suggest a way to improve its performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518121","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518121.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518121","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","startPage":"2361","endPage":"2364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On multicast beamforming and admission control for UMTS-LTE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"On multicast beamforming and admission control for UMTS-LTE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518121/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518121/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973463","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On multicast beamforming and admission control for UMTS-LTE","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053141S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4518122,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Roemer","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Roemer","id":"37295437800"},{"name":"Martin Haardt","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Haardt","id":"37285060400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518122","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518122","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Closed-form solution","Tensile stress","Multidimensional signal processing","Iterative methods","Least squares approximation","Data analysis","Psychometric testing","Communications technology","Signal analysis","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hermitian matrices","iterative methods","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel factor analysis","suboptimal closed-form solution","multiway signal processing","iterative method","joint matrix diagonalization problem","Hermitian symmetric model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multidimensional signal processing","Parameter estimation","Array signal processing","Direction of arrival estimation"]}],"abstract":"Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) is a branch of multi-way signal processing that has received increased attention recently. This is due to the large class of applications as well as the milestone identifiability results demonstrating the superiority to matrix (two-way) analysis approaches. A significant amount of research was dedicated to iterative methods to estimate the factors from noisy data. In many situations these require many iterations and are not guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. Therefore, suboptimal closed-form solutions were proposed as initializations. In this contribution we derive a closed-form solution to completely replace the iterative approach by transforming PARAFAC into several joint diagonalization problems. Thereby, we obtain several estimates for each of the factors and present a new \"best matching\" scheme to select the best estimate for each factor. In contrast to the techniques known from the literature, our closed-form solution can efficiently exploit symmetric as well as Hermitian symmetric models and solve the underdetermined case, if there are at least two modes that are non-degenerate and full rank. This closed-form solution achieves approximately the same performance as previously proposed iterative solutions and even outperforms them in critical scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518122","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518122.pdf","startPage":"2365","endPage":"2368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A closed-form solution for Parallel Factor (PARAFAC) Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518122/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"A closed-form solution for Parallel Factor (PARAFAC) Analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973464","htmlLink":"/document/4518122/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A closed-form solution for Parallel Factor (PARAFAC) Analysis","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048367S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4518123,"authors":[{"name":"Manav R.

Double-differential coding is a technique, which allows the receiver to decode the data without any channel or carrier offset knowledge. We propose a double-differential (DD) coding scheme which is applicable to any square orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC) using M-PSK constellation. The main advantages of the proposed DD coding scheme are: 1) The previously proposed DD codes are applicable only to the specific class of space-time block codes which follow the diagonal unitary group property, whereas our DD coding is applicable to any square OSTBC. 2) We propose a suboptimal decoder which preserves the linear decoding property of the OSTBC. We derive an upper bound of the pairwise error probability (PEP) of the proposed double-differential orthogonal space-time block codes (DDOSTBCs). The proposed DDOSTBC is able to achieve better performance than the similar rate existing DD coding scheme.

It is shown that using semi-definite relaxation (SDR), our channel estimation problem can be transferred to a convex form and then solved efficiently using modern convex optimization tools.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518126","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518126.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"2381","endPage":"2384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind channel estimation in MIMO-OFDM systems using semi-definite relaxation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind channel estimation in MIMO-OFDM systems using semi-definite relaxation","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518126/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973468","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518126/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind channel estimation in MIMO-OFDM systems using semi-definite relaxation","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05395S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518127,"authors":[{"name":"Javier M.

To obtain these codes, the proposed design adds extra-symbols to the OSTBC matrix using different reasonable strategies. Because of the internal OSTBC structure of the proposed designs, the ML decoder can be implemented in a fast way. Simulations validate an improved performance-to-complexity tradeoff of the proposed codes as compared to several other popular choices of space-time codes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Block codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Space time codes","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Code standards","Wireless communication","Receiving antennas","Probability density function","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","maximum likelihood decoding","orthogonal codes","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-rate spce-time block code","maximum-likelihood decoding","orthogonal space-time block code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Space-time coding","fast maximum-likelihood decoding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518127","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518127.pdf","startPage":"2385","endPage":"2388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-rate space-time block codes with fast maximum-likelihood decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-rate space-time block codes with fast maximum-likelihood decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518127/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518127/","accessionNumber":"9973469","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-rate space-time block codes with fast maximum-likelihood decoding","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00606.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040104S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4518128,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Song","affiliation":["Communication Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Song","id":"37400698000"},{"name":"Florian Roemer","affiliation":["Communication Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Roemer","id":"37295437800"},{"name":"Martin Haardt","affiliation":["Communication Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Haardt","id":"37285060400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518128","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Broadcasting","Transmitters","Vector quantization","Feedback","Throughput","Multiaccess communication","Transmitting antennas","Broadcast technology","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadcast channels","channel coding","diversity reception","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regularized block diagonalization precoding","linear precoding","multiantenna broadcast channel quantization","multiuser MIMO broadcast channel","limited feedback system","zero-forcing precoding","block diagonalization precoding","user channel matrix","random vector quantization","RBD precoding","perfect channel state information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MU-MIMO","Precoding","RVQ","DE-LBG"]}],"abstract":"Regularized block diagonalization (RBD) is a new linear precoding technique for the multi-antenna broadcast channel and has a significantly improved sum rate and diversity order compared to all previously proposed linear precoding techniques. We consider a limited feedback system with RBD precoding, in which each receiver has perfect channel state information (CSI) and quantizes its channel. The transmitter receives the quantized CSI with a finite number of feedback bits from each receiver. In contrast to zero-forcing (ZF) or block diagonalization (BD) precoding, where the transmitter only requires the channel direction information which refers to the knowledge of subspaces spanned by the users' channel matrices, for RBD precoding the transmitter additionally requires the channel magnitude information which defines the strength of the eigenmodes of the users' channel matrices. The key contribution of our work is that we propose a new scheme for the channel quantization to supply the transmitter with both channel direction and magnitude information. Based on this new scheme, firstly, we investigate a random vector quantization (RVQ). We derive a bound for the throughput loss due to imperfect CSI and find a way to achieve the bound by linearly increasing the number of feedback bits with the system SNR. Secondly, we modify the LBG vector quantization algorithm to obtain a dominant eigenvector based LBG (DE- LBG) vector quantization which can significantly reduce the number of feedback bits compared to RVQ. Finally, we demonstrate that the DE-LBG vector quantization can be applied to an OFDM-based multi-user MIMO system.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518128","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518128.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"2389","endPage":"2392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient channel quantization scheme for multi-user MIMO broadcast channels with RBD precoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518128","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient channel quantization scheme for multi-user MIMO broadcast channels with RBD precoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518128/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973470","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518128/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient channel quantization scheme for multi-user MIMO broadcast channels with RBD precoding","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108197S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518129,"authors":[{"name":"Chan-Byoung Chae","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group, University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Chan-Byoung","lastName":"Chae","id":"37275083600"},{"name":"Takao Inoue","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group, University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Takao","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37405926400"},{"name":"Robert W.

The algorithm is based on an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) that simultaneously adjusts the weight coefficients and inter-sensor spacings of a linear aperiodic array. A novel section-based crossover and a self-supervised mutation process are developed to improve the convergence performance. The results from simulation illustrate that with the IGA, the peak sidelobe level (PSL) of the synthesized beam pattern has been successfully lowered. In addition, the computational cost of the proposed algorithm can be as low as being about 10% of that of a recently reported genetic algorithm based synthesis method.

We also propose a framework for optimizing the 2D transform via an extension of standard dynamic programming (DP) algorithms, where a selection is made among alternative coding schemes (e.g., different number of levels in the wavelet decomposition).

The problem setup relies on maximizing the reciprocal of the MSE averaged with respect to the prescribed noise variance distribution. While the considered design metric is shown to be highly nonlinear in the local sensor transmit energy (or bit loads), we leverage several analytic approximation relations to derive a associated tractable lower bound; through maximizing this bound a closed-form solution is then obtained. Our analytical results reveal that sensors with bad link quality are shut off to conserve energy, whereas the energy allocated to those active nodes is proportional to the individual channel gain. Simulation results are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor fusion","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Energy measurement","Noise measurement","Closed-form solution","Energy efficiency","Quantization","Nonlinear distortion","Statistical distributions","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy constrained MMSE","decentralized estimation","partial sensor","noise variance knowledge","estimator fusion rule","quantized version","fusion center","channel gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decentralized estimation","Sensor networks","Energy efficiency","Quantization","Convex optimization"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518165","startPage":"2537","endPage":"2540","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518165.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-constrained MMSE decentralized estimation via partial sensor noise variance knowledge","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Energy-constrained MMSE decentralized estimation via partial sensor noise variance knowledge","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9973507","publicationDate":"March 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518165/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-constrained MMSE decentralized estimation via partial sensor noise variance knowledge","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00644.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0608S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4518172,"authors":[{"name":"Cha Zhang","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Cha Zhang","id":"37087157173"},{"name":"Dinei Florencio","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Dinei","lastName":"Florencio","id":"37284939900"},{"name":"Zhengyou Zhang","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhengyou Zhang","id":"37087070392"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518172","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":624},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic noise","Working environment noise","Reverberation","Microphone arrays","Maximum likelihood estimation","Phase noise","Noise robustness","Time difference of arrival","Delay estimation","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","architectural acoustics","maximum likelihood estimation","microphone arrays","reverberation","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise reverberative environment","time difference of arrival","TDOA","multi-microphone sound source localization","phase transform","maximum likelihood framework","room reverberation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sound source localization","phase transform","maximum likelihood","noise","reverberation"]}],"abstract":"Among many existing time difference of arrival (TDOA) based sound source localization (SSL) algorithms, the Phase Transform (PHAT) is extremely popular for its excellent performance in low noise environments, even under relatively heavy reverberation. However, PHAT was developed as a heuristic approach and its working principle has not been completely understood. In this paper, we present the relationship between PHAT and a maximum likelihood (ML) framework for multi-microphone sound source localization. We show that when the environment noise approaches zero, PHAT is indeed a special case of the ML algorithm, which explains its good performance under low noise environments. In addition, we show that as long as the noise stays low, PHAT remains optimal in ML sense even when the room reverberation is heavy, which explains its robustness over reverberation.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518172","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518172.pdf","startPage":"2565","endPage":"2568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Why does PHAT work well in lownoise, reverberative environments?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Why does PHAT work well in lownoise, reverberative environments?","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518172/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973514","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Why does PHAT work well in lownoise, reverberative environments?","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00651.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0549S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4518179,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"lastName":"Lei Wang","id":"37406752300"},{"name":"Yunlong Cai","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"lastName":"Yunlong Cai","id":"37595612300"},{"name":"Rodrigo C. de Lamare","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Rodrigo C.","lastName":"de Lamare","id":"37266614000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518179","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Convergence","Resonance light scattering","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational modeling","Interference","Adaptive arrays","Cost function","Stochastic processes","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","computational complexity","gradient methods","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind adaptive beamforming","low-complexity adaptive step size constrained constant modulus","stochastic gradient algorithm","computational complexity","nonstationary environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind adaptive beamforming techniques","constrained constant modulus (CCM)","modified adaptive step size (MASS)","time averaging adaptive step size(TAASS)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518179","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518179","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","abstract":"In this paper, two low-complexity adaptive step size algorithms are investigated for blind adaptive beamforming.

Results indicate that the proposed algorithms achieve superior performance, better convergence behavior and lower computational complexity in both stationary and non-stationary environments.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"2593","endPage":"2596","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518179.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity adaptive step size constrained constant modulus sg-based algorithms for blind adaptive beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518179/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518179/","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity adaptive step size constrained constant modulus sg-based algorithms for blind adaptive beamforming","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973521","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity adaptive step size constrained constant modulus sg-based algorithms for blind adaptive beamforming","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00658.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05924S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518180,"authors":[{"name":"Jwu-Sheng Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jwu-Sheng Hu","id":"37087167773"},{"name":"Chia-Hsing Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chia-Hsing Yang","id":"37087173065"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518180","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518180","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Adaptive arrays","Reverberation","Microphone arrays","Acoustic noise","Working environment noise","Transfer functions","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Programmable control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","adaptive filters","adaptive signal processing","array signal processing","interference suppression","matched filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal blocking","generalized sidelobe canceller","matched filter array","adaptive beamformer","blocking matrix design","signal cancellation problems","pseudo-inverse property","subarray structure","microphone pairs","sound source","acoustic environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GSC","matched filters","subarray"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive signal blocking for generalized sidelobe canceller using matched filter array","startPage":"2597","endPage":"2600","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518180.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518180","abstract":"This work proposes an adaptive beamformer based on generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) structure with novel blocking matrix design.

The focus of this work is on correlated channels with arbitrary antenna array geometry and spacings, a coherent receiver, and imperfect statistical knowledge at the transmitter. Leveraging a recently proposed channel modeling paradigm that exploits processing in the angular domain, we first elucidate the structure of the optimal schemes when 'genie-aided' perfect statistical information is available at the transmitter. In the low-S N R case, we then show that the beamforming scheme that is optimal when perfect statistical information is available does not degrade smoothly with imperfections in the statistical information. We then go on to show that there exists a certain low-complexity beamforming approach which, while being sub-optimal in the genie-aided case, is robust to statistical feedback as well as the dynamics of its evolution.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518186","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518186.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"2621","endPage":"2624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-robustness of statistics-based beamformer design in correlated MIMO channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-robustness of statistics-based beamformer design in correlated MIMO channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518186/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973528","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518186/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-robustness of statistics-based beamformer design in correlated MIMO channels","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00665.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095721S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4518189,"authors":[{"name":"N.

For that purpose, the SFSD generates a list of candidates that approximates that of the list sphere decoder (LSD) while containing information about all the possible bit values, removing the need for clipping. In addition, it overcomes the two problems of the LSD: its variable complexity and the sequential nature of its tree search.

First, we show that two of the existing 16-QAM SDR receivers, namely the polynomial-inspired SDR (PI-SDR) and bound-constrained SDR (BC-SDR) methods, are equivalent. Second, we develop a specialized interior-point algorithm for the implementation of BC-SDR.

A BER analysis for deterministic channels is first presented that identifies conditions under which SC with zero forcing detection outperforms OFDM. The analysis also motivates the use of MMSE detection in Rayleigh fading channels. An iterative receiver is then developed combining LDPC decoding, channel estimation under a numerosity constraint and CFO tracking. It is shown that MMSE turbo equalization arises naturally from the marginalization in the factor graph when the decoder extrinsic densities are approximated as Gaussian. A frequency-domain MMSE turbo equalizer is then combined with matching pursuits (MP) channel estimation. Simulation results for a realistic UAC channel are given showing consistent improvement using iterative processing.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Channel estimation","OFDM modulation","Acoustic signal detection","Matching pursuit algorithms","Underwater acoustics","Underwater communication","Bit error rate","Fading","Parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","equalisers","error statistics","iterative decoding","least mean squares methods","modulation coding","parity check codes","Rayleigh channels","turbo codes","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single carrier modulation","sparse channel estimation","underwater acoustic communication","BER analysis","bit error rate","Rayleigh fading channel","LDPC decoding","iterative joint decoding","MMSE turbo equalization","factor graph","frequency-domain MMSE turbo equalizer","minimum mean squared error","matching pursuits","deterministic channels","zero forcing detection","MMSE detection","iterative receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","iterative methods","decoding","parameter estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518203","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518203.pdf","startPage":"2689","endPage":"2692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative joint decoding and sparse channel estimation for single-carrier modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative joint decoding and sparse channel estimation for single-carrier modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518203/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518203/","accessionNumber":"9973545","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative joint decoding and sparse channel estimation for single-carrier modulation","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00682.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046309S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4518204,"authors":[{"name":"Predrag Radosavljevic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Predrag","lastName":"Radosavljevic","id":"37281719300"},{"name":"Joseph R.

If paths are enough, the performance of BFS-SIC algorithm can approach that of sphere decoding but is much more flexible due to its providing a good tradeoff between complexity and performance.

In the communications literature, these systems are referred to as optimum combining (OC) systems. We consider the practical case where the desired signal undergoes Rician fading, and is corrupted by Rayleigh-faded interfering signals and noise. We first propose new closed-form gamma approximations for the SINR distribution at the output of the OC combiner, which we show to be remarkably accurate. We then employ these approximations to derive new closed-form expressions for the ergodic capacity and simplified expressions for the high-SNR regime. These results reveal that the capacity improves monotonically with Rician K-factor.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518217","startPage":"2745","endPage":"2748","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518217.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum combining systems in the presence of Rician facing: SINR and capacity analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimum combining systems in the presence of Rician facing: SINR and capacity analysis","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518217/","accessionNumber":"9973559","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518217/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum combining systems in the presence of Rician facing: SINR and capacity analysis","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00696.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042287S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4518218,"authors":[{"name":"Amr El-Keyi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Amr","lastName":"El-Keyi","id":"38275224400"},{"name":"Benoit Champagne","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Champagne","id":"37296590000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518218","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":505},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Antenna arrays","Signal processing","Interference constraints","Optimization methods","Numerical simulation","Receiving antennas","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","MIMO communication","numerical analysis","optimisation","radio networks","telecommunication terminals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative MIMO-beamforming","multiuser relay networks","multiuser MIMO-relaying wireless systems","destination nodes","relay terminals","multiple antennas","beamforming matrices","destination node","relay beamforming problem","convex optimization problem","second-order cone program","interior point methods","numerical simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array signal processing","cooperative relaying","second-order cone programming"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we develop a beamforming algorithm for multiuser MIMO-relaying wireless systems.

The baseline is a genie-aided receiver, which has perfect CSIR knowledge without any power or rate expenditure. Alternatively, a mismatched receiver extracts CSIR by pilot symbol insertion and uses it in the perfect CSIR decision metric. Finally, an optimum receiver, avoiding direct CSIR detection, estimates the transmitted data from the whole received sample and from the knowledge of pilot symbols.

First, the optimal operating characteristics of sensing that maximizes the overall system rate for given training is investigated. It is shown that the optimal false alarm probability at the secondary sensor is monotone increasing as the activity of the primary user increases if the sensing ROC curve is concave. When the primary activity factor is unknown, the max-min criterion is applied to optimal sensing strategy and the resulting max-min optimal solution is given by an equalizer rule for any type of sensing ROC curve. The joint optimization of sensing and training has a unique solution and it can be easily found numerically using a gradient ascent algorithm. By optimal design of sensing and training in such a way, the overall system rate can be improved.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"2785","endPage":"2788","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518227.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On optimal operating characteristics of sensing and training for cognitive radios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518227/","displayDocTitle":"On optimal operating characteristics of sensing and training for cognitive radios","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973569","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On optimal operating characteristics of sensing and training for cognitive radios","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00706.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055652S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4518228,"authors":[{"name":"Nikhil Kundargi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin city, USA"],"firstName":"Nikhil","lastName":"Kundargi","id":"37391469700"},{"name":"Ahmed Tewfik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin city, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Tewfik","id":"37271583200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518228","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":338},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","digital television","fast Fourier transforms","IEEE standards","radio spectrum management","signal detection","telecommunication standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE 802.22 cognitive radio network","sequential pilot sensing","ATSC signals","advanced television systems committee","dynamic spectrum sensing","fast Fourier transforms","TV transmitter","FFT based pilot sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication standards","Radio spectrum management","Digital TV","Signal detection"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential pilot sensing of ATSC signals in IEEE 802.22 cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","endPage":"2792","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518228.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518228","startPage":"2789","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518228","abstract":"The IEEE 802.22 Standard promises to be the first practical implementation of the cognitive radio technology. It is based on dynamic spectrum sensing and opportunistic access of the bands that are not currently in use by TV transmitters. FFT based pilot sensing of the TV signal is recommended in the standard. The sensing is carried out by averaging over a fixed number of multiple dwells (6-10). We propose a sequential version of the scheme where the number of dwells required is dynamically varying according to the fidelity of the received signal. We show via simulation that the proposed sequential sensing strategy yields a throughput gain and reduces system overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9973570","htmlLink":"/document/4518228/","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Sequential pilot sensing of ATSC signals in IEEE 802.22 cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential pilot sensing of ATSC signals in IEEE 802.22 cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00707.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051137S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518229,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Quan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Quan","id":"37401122300"},{"name":"Shuguang Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Shuguang","lastName":"Cui","id":"37267838900"},{"name":"Ali H.

We assume that the cognitive radio senses the activity in each channel at the beginning of every symbol period, and that a usage cost is assigned to each channel that depends on the channel's physical-layer characteristics and the sensing outcome. We fully characterize the transmission scheme that minimizes the time-averaged cost, subject to interference constraints imposed by the primaries.

In the present contribution, adherence to hierarchies between primary and secondary users in a peer-to-peer CR network is enabled through distributed power control. Hierarchies are effected by imposing minimum and maximum bounds on a quality-of-service (QoS) metric, such as communication rate. These bounds translate to signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. Furthermore, a utility function captures each user's satisfaction with the received SINR. The novel power control strategy maximizes the total utility while respecting individual SINR constraints - a task recast as a convex optimization problem under a suitable relaxation. Sufficient conditions, realistic for practical CR networks, are provided to obtain the optimal power allocation from the solution of the relaxed problem. Finally, a low-overhead distributed algorithm for optimal power control is developed, and tested against competing alternatives via simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518232","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518232.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"2805","endPage":"2808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utility-based power control for peer-to-peer cognitive radio networks with heterogeneous QoS constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Utility-based power control for peer-to-peer cognitive radio networks with heterogeneous QoS constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518232/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973574","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518232/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility-based power control for peer-to-peer cognitive radio networks with heterogeneous QoS constraints","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00711.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06126S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518233,"authors":[{"name":"Keyvan Zarifi","affiliation":["Communication Systems Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Keyvan","lastName":"Zarifi","id":"37284691900"},{"name":"Alex B.

Simulation results show that when the optimal GCD weighting matrices are used, the estimation performance is substantially improved as compared to the conventional singular value decomposition (SVD)-based blind channel estimation techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind channel estimation in DS-CDMA systems with unknown wide-sense stationary noise using generalized correlation decomposition","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518233","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518233.pdf","startPage":"2809","endPage":"2812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Blind channel estimation in DS-CDMA systems with unknown wide-sense stationary noise using generalized correlation decomposition","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518233/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973575","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind channel estimation in DS-CDMA systems with unknown wide-sense stationary noise using generalized correlation decomposition","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00712.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.139276S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4518235,"authors":[{"name":"Weiyu Xu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, California Institute of Technology, USA"],"lastName":"Weiyu Xu","id":"37404295700"},{"name":"Mihailo Stojnic","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, California Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Mihailo","lastName":"Stojnic","id":"37395583000"},{"name":"Babak Hassibi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, California Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Babak","lastName":"Hassibi","id":"37274470800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518235","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Maximum likelihood decoding","Channel estimation","Mobile communication","Signal detection","Constellation diagram","Energy consumption","Very large scale integration","Numerical stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","maximum likelihood detection","maximum likelihood estimation","mobile radio","sequential decoding","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity blind joint maximum-likelihood detection","SIMO systems","single-input multiple-output wireless systems","high data rate reliable communications","dynamic mobile environment","channel estimation","signal detection","general modulation constellations","sequential decoder","VLSI implementation","numerical stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blind ML detection","decoding complexity","SIMO","maximum-likelihood","sphere decoder"]}],"abstract":"The demand for high data rate reliable communications poses great challenges to the next generation wireless systems in highly dynamic mobile environments.

Unlike other known methods, the new decoder can even efficiently find the joint ML solution under high spectral efficiency non-constant- modulus modulation constellations. In particular, the new algorithm does not need such preprocessing steps as Cholesky or QR decomposition in the traditional sphere decoders for joint ML channel estimation and data detection. The elimination of such preprocessing not only reduces the number of floating point computations, but also will potentially lead to smaller size and power consumption in VLSI implementations while providing better numerical stability.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518235","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518235.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"2817","endPage":"2820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity blind maximum-likelihood detection for SIMO systems with general constellations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity blind maximum-likelihood detection for SIMO systems with general constellations","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518235/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973577","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518235/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity blind maximum-likelihood detection for SIMO systems with general constellations","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00714.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063584S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4518237,"authors":[{"name":"Stefania Colonnese","affiliation":["Dip.

In this paper, we show how to perform blind maximum-likelihood data recovery in OFDM transmission from the output symbol and cyclic prefix. Our approach relies on decomposing the OFDM channel into two subchannels (cyclic and linear) that share the same input and are characterized by the same channel parameters. This fact enables us to estimate the channel parameters from one subchannel and substitute the estimate into the other, thus obtaining a nonlinear relationship involving the input and output data only. The relationship does not show any channel dependence whatsoever and can be exhaustively searched for the maximum likelihood estimate of the input. This shows that OFDM systems are completely identifiable using output data only, irrespective of the channel zeros, as long as the channel delay spread is less than the length of the cyclic prefix.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind maximum-likelihood data recovery in OFDM","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518238","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518238.pdf","startPage":"2829","endPage":"2832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Blind maximum-likelihood data recovery in OFDM","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518238/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973580","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind maximum-likelihood data recovery in OFDM","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00717.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035238S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518239,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Choqueuse","affiliation":["ENSIETA-Ecole Nationale Superieure des Ingenieurs des Etudes et Techniques d''Armement, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Choqueuse","id":"37563968900"},{"name":"Koffi Yao","affiliation":["UBO, LEST-UMR-CNRS 6165, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Koffi","lastName":"Yao","id":"37595073200"},{"name":"Ludovic Collin","affiliation":["UBO, LEST-UMR-CNRS 6165, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Ludovic","lastName":"Collin","id":"37294003000"},{"name":"Gilles Burel","affiliation":["UBO, LEST-UMR-CNRS 6165, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Burel","id":"37268166900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518239","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":249},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Block codes","Transmitters","Vectors","MIMO","Military communication","Transmitting antennas","Space technology","Military computing","Timing","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","correlation methods","linear codes","signal detection","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind recognition","linear space time block codes","military communication system","time-lag correlation","signal detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Signal Detection","MIMO Systems","Electronic Warfare","Space time coding"]}],"abstract":"The blind recognition of communication parameters is a key research issue for commercial and military communication systems.

Numerous designs have been proposed to collect the diversity from different types of channels. However, since the simulators and practical systems can only afford finite bits to represent the real/complex numbers, the definition of diversity needs to be revisited. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the effects of finite-bit representation on the statistical properties of the channel and the diversity with different transmitters/receivers. We show that finite-bit representation may cause diversity loss relative to the infinite precision representation. For different transmission systems, the diversity loss follows different patterns as the number of bits decreases. Furthermore, we find that the number of non-vanishing eigenvalues plays an important role in quantizing the diversity for infinite lattice/constellation. Numerical examples verify our theoretical findings.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Transmitters","Lattices","Fading","Equalizers","OFDM","Gaussian channels","Signal to noise ratio","Collaborative work","Government"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","fading channels","statistical analysis","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity quantification","wireless systems","finite-bit representation","diversity order","wireless transmission reliability","fading channels","statistical properties","infinite precision representation","transmission systems","eigenvalues","infinite lattice","infinite constellation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diversity","finite-bit representation","maximum likelihood equalizer","lattice reduction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518241","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518241.pdf","startPage":"2841","endPage":"2844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantifying diversity for wireless systems with finite-bit representation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quantifying diversity for wireless systems with finite-bit representation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518241/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518241/","accessionNumber":"9973583","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantifying diversity for wireless systems with finite-bit representation","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00720.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042132S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518241","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4518243,"authors":[{"name":"Ervin Sejdic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ervin","lastName":"Sejdic","id":"38187764300"},{"name":"Marco Luccini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Luccini","id":"37394049500"},{"name":"Serguei Primak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Serguei","lastName":"Primak","id":"37268311300"},{"name":"Kareem Baddour","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Kareem","lastName":"Baddour","id":"37269745400"},{"name":"Tricia Willink","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Tricia","lastName":"Willink","id":"37285074600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518243","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":268},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518243","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Bandwidth","Frequency","Matching pursuit algorithms","Upper bound","Testing","Mobile communication","Fading","Rayleigh scattering","Time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","discrete prolate spheroidal sequences","time-varying channels","mobile channel parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time-varying channels","channel estimation","discrete prolate spheroidal sequences","frames"]}],"abstract":"Accurate and sparse representation of a moderately fast fading channel using bases functions is achievable when both channel and bases bands align. If a mismatch exists, usually a larger number of bases functions is needed to achieve the same accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for channel estimation based on frames, which preserves sparsity and improves estimation accuracy. Members of the frame are formed by modulating and varying the bandwidth of discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS) in order to reflect various scattering scenarios. To achieve the sparsity of the proposed representation, a matching pursuit approach is employed. The estimation accuracy of the scheme is evaluated and compared with the accuracy of a Slepian basis expansion estimator based on DPSS for a variety of mobile channel parameters. The results clearly indicate that for the same number of atoms, a significantly higher estimation accuracy is achievable with the proposed scheme when compared to the DPSS estimator.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518243.pdf","startPage":"2849","endPage":"2852","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation using DPSS based frames","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation using DPSS based frames","htmlLink":"/document/4518243/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9973585","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation using DPSS based frames","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00722.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04693S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518244,"authors":[{"name":"Tim Whitworth","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Whitworth","id":"37313204200"},{"name":"Mounir Ghogho","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Mounir","lastName":"Ghogho","id":"37284467100"},{"name":"Desmond C.

Simulation results demonstrate a significant reduction of the number of pilots relative to least-squares channel estimation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518252.pdf","startPage":"2885","endPage":"2888","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compressed sensing technique for OFDM channel estimation in mobile environments: Exploiting channel sparsity for reducing pilots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Channel estimation","Vectors","Mobile communication","Radio frequency","Wireless sensor networks","Pulse compression methods","Delay estimation","OFDM modulation","Mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","mobile communication","OFDM modulation","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","OFDM","channel estimation","mobile environments","channel sparsity","doubly selective channels","wireless channels","pulse-shaping multicarrier systems","delay-Doppler sparsity","spectral efficiency","least-squares estimation","sparse signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","multicarrier modulation","channel estimation","compressed sensing","sparse reconstruction","basis pursuit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"A compressed sensing technique for OFDM channel estimation in mobile environments: Exploiting channel sparsity for reducing pilots","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518252/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973594","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compressed sensing technique for OFDM channel estimation in mobile environments: Exploiting channel sparsity for reducing pilots","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06513S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4518254,"authors":[{"name":"Amine Mezghani","affiliation":["Institute for Circuit Theory and Signal Processing, Munich University of Technology, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Amine","lastName":"Mezghani","id":"37294420600"},{"name":"Mohamed-Seifeddine Khoufi","affiliation":["Institute for Circuit Theory and Signal Processing, Munich University of Technology, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Seifeddine","lastName":"Khoufi","id":"38096609000"},{"name":"Josef A.

First, the minimum mean square error (MMSE) optimal vector precoding (VP) is presented for different receiver structures, viz., weighted identity matrix, diagonal matrix, weighted unitary matrix, and matrix without particular structure. Whereas the former two structures can also be applied to the vector broadcast channel, the latter two are only realizable for cooperative receivers. Second, VP is derived that minimizes the MSE but is restricted to maximize the mutual information of the MIMO channel. Third, the corresponding Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) is found by applying the nearest-plane approximation to the computation of the perturbation signal. The resulting maximum mutual information THP clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art P2P-MIMO THP based on the generalized triangular decomposition (GTD) with respect to MSE and BER.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518262","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518262.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"2925","endPage":"2928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Point-to-point MIMO MMSE vector precoding and thp achieving capacity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Point-to-point MIMO MMSE vector precoding and thp achieving capacity","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518262/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973604","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518262/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Point-to-point MIMO MMSE vector precoding and thp achieving capacity","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00741.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048418S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518264,"authors":[{"name":"Eunmo Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"],"lastName":"Eunmo Kang","id":"37827772000"},{"name":"Akbar M.

In this paper we propose a method for designing a precoder codebook for LD codes in spatially and temporally correlated channels. Our codebook consists of two parts: a unitary codebook and a diagonal codebook. We propose a systematic algorithm for a unitary code- book design because unitary codebooks are hard to generate using numerical optimization methods. For each column (starting with the first column), we generate a set of vectors in the null space of previous columns. These vectors are generated by skewing i.i.d. unit vector codebooks by means of channel statistics-dependent transformations. A diagonal codebook is generated using a vector quantization technique. We use mutual information as a design criterion throughout this paper. Numerical results illustrate the benefits of matching a codebook to channel statistics and employing adaptive power shaping.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518264","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518264.pdf","startPage":"2933","endPage":"2936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoder codebook design for linear dispersion codes in spatially and temporally correlated MIMO channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518264/","displayDocTitle":"Precoder codebook design for linear dispersion codes in spatially and temporally correlated MIMO channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973606","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518264/","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoder codebook design for linear dispersion codes in spatially and temporally correlated MIMO channels","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075463S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518265,"authors":[{"name":"Irfan Ghauri","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies France, GAIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Irfan","lastName":"Ghauri","id":"37369750500"},{"name":"Shakti P.

In a linear time-invariant channel, this bias is constant at chip-equalizer output, but evolves over time at code correlator output impacting Signal-to-Interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and thus achievable rates in such receivers. In principle, this bias must be taken into account in further RX/decoding stages even if its impact is small. It is shown that a new class of maximum-likelihood (ML) RX leading to potential performance gains is obtained when properly accounting for symbol-level bias across a set of user codes.

Two practical schemes for the GE correlation model are also presented, with performance about 1.5 dB away from the lower bound.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518266","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518266.pdf","startPage":"2941","endPage":"2944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Source coding with intermittent and degraded side information at the decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Source coding with intermittent and degraded side information at the decoder","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518266/","publicationDate":"March 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9973608","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518266/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source coding with intermittent and degraded side information at the decoder","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060756S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4518271,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"lastName":"Jie Huang","id":"37407359000"},{"name":"Shengli Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"lastName":"Shengli Zhou","id":"37276854700"},{"name":"Peter Willett","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Willett","id":"37268359200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518271","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Parallel processing","Graph theory","Throughput","Galois fields","Belief propagation","Encoding","Error correction codes","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonbinary regular LDPC cycle codes","parity check matrix","row-permuted block-diagonal matrices","spanning subgraph","parallel processing","linear-time encoding","sequential belief-propagation decoding","decoding complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonbinary","LDPC","cycle code","Galois field","graph theory"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study non-binary regular LDPC cycle codes whose parity check matrix has fixed column weight 2 and fixed row weight d.

Utilizing this structure enables parallel processing in linear-time encoding, and parallel processing in sequential belief-propagation decoding, which increases the throughput without compromising performance or complexity.

The proposed protocol is shown to outperform all the existing algorithms based on either NDMA or MPR. Additionally, the protocol formulation provides an important generalization of the model used for the analysis of solutions in these three fields. Unlike conventional NDMA protocols, in which all the colliding users are requested to immediately retransmit in the next time-slot, our proposed algorithm calculates the optimum set of users allowed to retransmit at each one of the following time-slots. The optimization is based on the previous collected transmissions and on the MPR and source separation (SS) probabilities, thus maximizing throughput and minimizing access-delay. Two possible suboptimal algorithms with simplified feedback assumption and hence suitable for distributed resolution are further derived from the original algorithm: an enhanced version of NDMA assisted by MPR and a fair splitting tree algorithm assisted by MPR and SS. The capacity/stability region of the protocol for several system configurations with two active users is employed to assess the benefits of the proposed algorithms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518282","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518282.pdf","startPage":"3005","endPage":"3008","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiaccess protocol assisted by retransmission diversity and multipacket reception","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"A multiaccess protocol assisted by retransmission diversity and multipacket reception","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518282/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973624","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518282/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiaccess protocol assisted by retransmission diversity and multipacket reception","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00761.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043874S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518284,"authors":[{"name":"Akbar Sayeed","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Akbar","lastName":"Sayeed","id":"37273438400"},{"name":"Adrian Perrig","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Perrig","id":"37271812800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518284","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":118,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1526},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518284","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Communication system security","Quantization","Cryptographic protocols","Cryptography","Probability","Energy consumption","Context","Wireless application protocol","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cryptographic protocols","multipath channels","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure wireless communication","cryptographic techniques","security protocol","multipath wireless channel","channel estimation","channel quantization","optimum quantization strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["key pre-distribution","channel estimation","quantization","wideband transceivers","energy minimization"]}],"abstract":"Secure wireless communications is a challenging problem due to the shared nature of the wireless medium. Most existing security protocols apply cryptographic techniques for bit scrambling at the application layer by exploiting a shared secret key between pairs of communicating nodes. However, more recent research argues that multipath propagation - a salient feature of wireless channels - provides a physical resource for secure communications. In this context, we propose a protocol that exploits the inherent randomness in multipath wireless channels for generating secret keys through channel estimation and quantization. Our approach is particularly attractive in wideband channels which exhibit a large number of statistically independent degrees of freedom (DoF), thereby enabling the generation of large, more-secure, keys. We show that the resulting keys are distinct for distinct pairwise links with a probability that increases exponentially with the key-size/channel DoF. We also characterize the probability that the two users sharing a common link generate the same key. This characterization is used to analyze the energy consumption in successful acquisition of a secret key by the two users. For a given key size, our results show that there is an optimum transmit power, and an optimum quantization strategy, that minimizes the energy consumption. The proposed approach to secret key generation through channel quantization also obviates the problem of key pre-distribution inherent to many existing cryptographic approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518284","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518284.pdf","startPage":"3013","endPage":"3016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure wireless communications: Secret keys through multipath","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Secure wireless communications: Secret keys through multipath","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518284/","accessionNumber":"9973626","publicationDate":"March 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure wireless communications: Secret keys through multipath","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00763.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036301S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4518287,"authors":[{"name":"Vasanthan Raghavan","affiliation":["Urbana-Champaign, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Vasanthan","lastName":"Raghavan","id":"37285687800"},{"name":"Akbar M.

If the true statistics of the channel coefficients are non-separable, the separability assumption leads to a flattening and spreading of the degrees of freedom (DoF) in the channel, and hence results in misleading estimates of capacity - an observation consistent with many measurement campaigns. Towards understanding this observation, we first elucidate the importance of channel power normalization, an often-ignored notion, in the capacity analysis of correlated channels. Using tools from random matrix theory, we characterize the mismatch in estimating capacity with the separable model, and thus provide a theoretical underpinning behind many measurement-based observations.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518287","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518287.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"3025","endPage":"3028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of mismatched statistics on correlated MIMO capacity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of mismatched statistics on correlated MIMO capacity","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518287/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973629","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518287/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of mismatched statistics on correlated MIMO capacity","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00766.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078499S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518288,"authors":[{"name":"W.-J.

One objective in the design of the JSPS for MISO transmissions is to eliminate the requirement for the different preamble fields used for coarse and fine synchronization and channel training. In this work, independent JSPSs are designed for each transmitter in a multiple antenna system, but are transmitted simultaneously from each antenna. Consequently, JSPSs can potentially reduce the overhead of multiple antenna preamble transmissions (improving bandwidth efficiency). The objective of this paper is to determine the performance advantages of joint carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel estimation using only the pilot portion of the JSPS. By jointly optimizing the position and power of each pilot across the transmitter antennas in Rayleigh fading channels with CFO, we show > 15 dB SNR improvement in the performance of the channel estimator.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518289.pdf","startPage":"3033","endPage":"3036","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MISO joint synchronization-pilot design for OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency synchronization","Channel estimation","Transmitting antennas","Transmitters","Frequency estimation","OFDM modulation","Bit error rate","Degradation","Timing","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MISO joint synchronization-pilot design","OFDM systems","multiple transmitter OFDM systems","multiple antenna system","channel estimation","Rayleigh fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","pilot symbol assisted modulation (PSAM)","pilot design","MISO systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"MISO joint synchronization-pilot design for OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518289/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973631","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MISO joint synchronization-pilot design for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00768.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055698S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518290,"authors":[{"name":"Semih Serbetli","affiliation":["Philips Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Semih","lastName":"Serbetli","id":"37269534700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518290","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"abstract":"In OFDM systems, Doppler spreading due to the mobility of the receiver distorts the orthogonality among the subcarriers, and results in intercarrier interference that degrades the performance.

Standard OFDM systems use guard interval (QI) in form of cyclic prefix (CP) and nulltones (NT) redundancy. In this paper, we are interested in exploiting simultaneously the CP and the NT to achieve blindly the channel shortening. We start by proving that the restoration of NT property leads to the desired channel shortening. However, the performance of the shortening based only on the NT is relatively poor. We propose to improve it by using the NT in conjunction with the CP redundancy. Hence, the Gl-based shortening criterion is combined with the NT-based criterion via a scalar weighting coefficient. The latter is optimized to improve symbol error rate (SER) performance of the receiver. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance of the combined criterion as compared to the GI-Based (MERRY algorithm) or NT-based criteria.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518291.pdf","startPage":"3041","endPage":"3044","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Channel Shortening in OFDM System using Nulltones and Cyclic Prefix","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Redundancy","Digital video broadcasting","Intersymbol interference","Error analysis","Communication standards","Digital audio broadcasting","DSL","Adaptive equalizers","Blind equalizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind channel shortening","OFDM system","cyclic prefix","guard interval","nulltones redundancy","symbol error rate","SER","scalar weighting coefficient"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Blind channel shortening","Differential encoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Blind Channel Shortening in OFDM System using Nulltones and Cyclic Prefix","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518291/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973633","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Channel Shortening in OFDM System using Nulltones and Cyclic Prefix","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00770.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062894S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4518293,"authors":[{"name":"Shuichi Ohno","affiliation":["Department of ACSE, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan"],"lastName":"Shuichi Ohno","id":"37267254300"},{"name":"Kok Ann Donny Teo","affiliation":["ACL, Defence Science Organisation, Singapore"],"lastName":"Kok Ann Donny Teo","id":"37291346700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518293","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"abstract":"Maximum Likelihood (ML) equalization for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) over time- and frequency- selective channels is analyzed in this paper.

Due to the channel effect, one needs to further identify the channel impulse response (CIR) so as to obtain a better ST estimation. Overall, the required computational complexity is high because it involves correlation operation, as well as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT (IFFT) operations. In this work, without the FFT/IFFT operations and the knowledge of CIR, a low-complexity time-domain ST estimation is proposed. We first characterize the frequency-domain interference effect as a function of the ST by deriving some analytical equations considering the channel effect. Based on the derivation, the new method locates the symbol boundary at the sampling point with the minimum interference in the frequency-domain. Moreover, for reducing the computational complexity, the proposed frequency-domain minimum-interference metric is converted into a low- complexity time-domain metric by utilizing the Parseval's theorem and the sampling theory. Simulation results exhibit high performances for the proposed algorithm in the multipath fading channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518294.pdf","startPage":"3053","endPage":"3056","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity symbol time estimation for OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency domain analysis","Computational complexity","Time domain analysis","Interference","Sampling methods","Frequency synchronization","Frequency division multiplexing","Fast Fourier transforms","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","estimation theory","fading channels","fast Fourier transforms","frequency-domain analysis","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","sampling methods","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM system","low-complexity symbol time estimation","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","channel impulse response","computational complexity","correlation operation","inverse fast Fourier transform","frequency-domain minimum-interference metric","Parseval theorem","sampling theory","multipath fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Symbol Time Estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity symbol time estimation for OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518294/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973636","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity symbol time estimation for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00773.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063391S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4518296,"authors":[{"name":"Renato L.

The capacity of PAR reduction can be increased by improving the PAR statistics at the cost of complexity of the OFDM transmitter. However, it is difficult to clarify the performance degradation in the presence of nonlinearities, such as a power amplifier (PA), with the PAR metric because the statistical distribution of PAR focuses only on the highest peak, even though PAR reduction can help to reduce the required PA backoff. The nonlinear distortion is related to the amount of signal greater than the saturated threshold value; therefore, it is desirable to know the envelope power distribution.

The Kalman filter, with known channel statistics, is utilized for evaluating the performance bounds.

RF impairments such as in-phase quadrature-phase (IQ) imbalance and carrier frequency offset (CFO) are unavoidable in low-cost analog front-end systems, but can result in a severe performance degradation. In this paper, a digital compensation scheme is developed for joint transmitter and receiver IQ imbalance along with front-end filter mismatch, CFO and frequency selective channel distortions in OFDM based MIMO systems. This scheme can also be extended for the multi-user scenario where each user signal suffers from a different frequency offset along with IQ imbalance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518305.pdf","startPage":"3097","endPage":"3100","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation of RF impairments in MIMO OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","MIMO","OFDM","Frequency domain analysis","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Low pass filters","Degradation","Radio transmitters","Digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","equalisers","frequency-domain analysis","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF impairment compensation","MIMO OFDM system","frequency domain equalization","multiinput multioutput system","frequency selective channel distortion","multiuser scenario","front-end filter mismatching","carrier frequency offset","joint transmitter-receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","multi-user systems","in-phase quadrature-phase (IQ) imbalance","carrier frequency offset (CFO)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Compensation of RF impairments in MIMO OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518305/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973647","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation of RF impairments in MIMO OFDM systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00784.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053923S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4518306,"authors":[{"name":"Ramy H.

Therefore, the proposed scheme can be regarded as a natural but nontrivial limited feedback version of UCD-VBLAST Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518308.pdf","startPage":"3109","endPage":"3112","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518308","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518308","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518308","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Transmitters","Array signal processing","Matrix decomposition","Information rates","Error analysis","MIMO","User centered design","Laboratories","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["limited feedback design","V-BLAST","quantized precoding scheme","precoding matrix","beamforming matrix","power allocation matrix","optimization problem","codebook"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["V-BLAST","MMSE-SIC","beamforming","power allocation","limited feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518308/","displayDocTitle":"Limited feedback design for V-BLAST","accessionNumber":"9973650","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518308/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited feedback design for V-BLAST","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00787.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05124S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":4518310,"authors":[{"name":"Emil Bjornson","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH Signal Processing Laboratory, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Bjornson","id":"37322949300"},{"name":"Bjorn Ottersten","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH Signal Processing Laboratory, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bjorn","lastName":"Ottersten","id":"37266309700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518310","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"abstract":"In wireless multiple antenna and multi-user systems, the spatial dimensions may be exploited to increase the performance by means of antenna gain, spatial diversity, and multi-user diversity.

Herein, the properties of spatially correlated channels with long-term statistical information at the transmitter and fixed-rate feedback of the quantized Euclidean channel norm are analyzed using a spectral subspace decomposition framework. A spatial division multiple access scheme is proposed with interference suppression at the receiver and joint scheduling and zero-forcing beamforming at the transmitter.

constraints can be reformulated as a conic quadratic optimization problem and efficiently solved, if the transmitter is provided with the perfect information about the channel. In this work, we study the robust counterpart of the latter, convex problem. By robustness it is meant that the base station knows only uncertainty regions where the exact channels lie, and that it is supposed to satisfy the conic quadratic constraints for all channels that belong to these regions. We provide a direct optimal solution for this problem, based on the ellipsoid method from convex optimization theory. By exploiting the structure of the problem, we define also a virtual robust mean square error optimization problem, that can be solved by semidefinite programming methods in a much more efficient manner, and which presents (at least) a tight conservative approximation of the main problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518311","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518311.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"3121","endPage":"3124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink precoding for multiuser MISO systems with imperfect channel knowledge","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Downlink precoding for multiuser MISO systems with imperfect channel knowledge","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518311/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973653","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518311/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink precoding for multiuser MISO systems with imperfect channel knowledge","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00790.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052966S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518313,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Joham","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Joham","id":"37285062400"},{"name":"Paula M.

Since the transmitter has no access to this information in many cases, the CSI must be fed back from the receivers to the transmitter. Before the feedback, the receivers estimate the CSI and apply a rank reduction possible due to the channel correlations. We propose a joint optimization of the estimation, the rank reduction, and the codebook used for the feedback. Interestingly, the estimator and the rank reduction resulting from this monolithic formulation are independent of the used codebook which can be computed with the generalized Lloyd algorithm. Applying the proposed feedback design to a system with multi-user precoding based on CSI feedback shows the clear superiority of the optimized codebook compared to previous designs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Transmitters","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Noise robustness","Broadcasting","Channel state information","Design optimization","Transceivers","Time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel coding","feedback","mean square error methods","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE optimal feedback","multi-user precoding","channel state information","broadcast channel","mean square methods","multi-user channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feedback systems","mean square methods","transceivers","multi-user channel"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518313","startPage":"3129","endPage":"3132","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518313.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE optimal feedback of correlated CSI for multi-user precoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"MMSE optimal feedback of correlated CSI for multi-user precoding","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9973655","publicationDate":"March 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518313/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE optimal feedback of correlated CSI for multi-user precoding","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00792.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077389S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4518314,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The various transmit antennas send independent streams and the spreading codes are scrambled Walsh-Hadamard sequences, the various transmit antennas being allocated different scrambling codes. The behaviour of the SINR provided by the receiver is first studied when the spreading factor and the number of users per antenna converge to +infin at the same rate. It is shown that the SINR converges towards a simple expression depending on the particular realization of the frequency selective channel between the base station and the mobile of interest. In order to get more insights on the long term performance, the ergodic sum-capacity delivered by the system is evaluated in the large number of antennas regime in the case the impulse response taps of the channel are Gaussian random matrices. A simple expression is obtained. It appears to be quite reliable for a realistic number of antennas, and is discussed in order to get some insights on the overall performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518314.pdf","startPage":"3133","endPage":"3136","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of spatial-multiplexing MIMO-CDMA downlink receivers based on chip rate equalization and despreading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Multiaccess communication","Signal to noise ratio","Antennas and propagation","3G mobile communication","Mobile antennas","Equalizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","equalisers","Gaussian processes","Hadamard codes","MIMO communication","radio receivers","random processes","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial-multiplexing MIMO-CDMA downlink receiver","chip rate equalization","despreading","transmit antenna","Walsh-Hadamard sequences","scrambling code","frequency selective channel","impulse response","Gaussian random matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","MIMO","large system performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of spatial-multiplexing MIMO-CDMA downlink receivers based on chip rate equalization and despreading","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518314/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973656","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of spatial-multiplexing MIMO-CDMA downlink receivers based on chip rate equalization and despreading","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00793.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04622S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4518315,"authors":[{"name":"Olof Sjobergh","affiliation":["KTH Signal Processing Laboratory, ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Sweden"],"firstName":"Olof","lastName":"Sjobergh","id":"37936931500"},{"name":"Eduard A.

This paper proposes a practical uplink MIMO scheme for time division duplex (TDD) systems to co-exist with BD, so that the CSI of the BD channels is used also in the uplink transmission. It is shown that the precoded pilot symbols are sufficient in both uplink and downlink to satisfy the needs of both transmission and reception. The capacity of the system is analyzed in conjunction with linear receivers in a time-varying fading channel. According to the results the proposed uplink strategy provides capacity gain over non-precoded transmission, without being sensitive to Doppler.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518316.pdf","startPage":"3141","endPage":"3144","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser MIMO transceiver strategy for TDD Uplink and downlink in time-varying channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transceivers","Downlink","Time-varying channels","Multiaccess communication","Radio transmitters","Channel state information","Fading","Matrix decomposition","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel capacity","channel coding","fading channels","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding","radio links","time-varying channels","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO transceiver strategy","TDD uplink","TDD downlink","block diagonalization","multiple-input multiple-output strategy","transmitter channel state information","time division duplex system","time-varying fading channel","channel capacity","linear receiver","precoded pilot symbols","cellular radio systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiuser MIMO","time division duplex (TDD)","space division multiaccess (SDMA)","block diagonalization (BD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser MIMO transceiver strategy for TDD Uplink and downlink in time-varying channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518316/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973658","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser MIMO transceiver strategy for TDD Uplink and downlink in time-varying channel","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00795.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067359S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4518317,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Curtis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Luke","lastName":"Curtis","id":"38098070300"},{"name":"Jamal Tuqan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jamal","lastName":"Tuqan","id":"37295155800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518317","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Resource management","Downlink","Partitioning algorithms","Channel state information","Transmitters","WiMAX","Communication standards","OFDM modulation","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","optimisation","resource allocation","telecommunication links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","dynamic resource allocation","OFDMA downlink networks","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","non convex optimization problem","mean squared error","user utility function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","Multi-user OFDM","PSAM","Channel Estimation","Resource Allocation","downlink channel","WiMAX"]}],"abstract":"The dynamic allocation of resources in OFDMA networks has recently been an active area of research. Most of the given solutions in the literature assume however that perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter side. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that jointly estimates the channel and allocates resources in OFDMA networks. Unlike the previous OFDMA channel estimation algorithms, we consider here the downlink case. The proposed approach transforms the original non-convex optimization problem into a set of consecutive smaller sub-problems that can be efficiently solved in an independent manner. The algorithm minimizes the mean squared error of the estimate of the channel while maximizing the average user utility function of the OFDMA system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient algorithm for channel estimation and resource allocation in OFDMA downlink networks","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518317","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518317.pdf","startPage":"3145","endPage":"3148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"An efficient algorithm for channel estimation and resource allocation in OFDMA downlink networks","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518317/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973659","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient algorithm for channel estimation and resource allocation in OFDMA downlink networks","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00796.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045779S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518318,"authors":[{"name":"Minhua Ding","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Queen''s University Belfast, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Minhua Ding","id":"37399155200"},{"name":"Steven D.

This feature is a key element that enables it to operate at a significantly lower complexity than currently reported schemes. The main innovation is a simple means of expanding/visiting the intermediate nodes of the search tree on-demand, rather than exhaustively or approximately, and also directly within the complex-domain framework. In addition, a new distributed sorting scheme is developed to keep track of the best candidates at each search phase; the combined expansion and sorting cores are able to find the K best candidates in just K clock cycles. Its support of unbounded infinite lattice decoding distinguishes our work from previous K-best strategies and also allows its complexity to scale sub-linearly with modulation order. Since the expansion and sorting cores cooperate on a data-driven basis, the architecture is well-suited for a pipelined parallel VLSI implementation of the proposed K-best lattice decoder. Comparative results demonstrating the promising performance, complexity and latency profiles of our proposal are provided in the context of the 4x4 MIMO detection problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518324","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518324.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518324","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","startPage":"3173","endPage":"3176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pipelined scalable high-throughput implementation of a near-ML K-best complex lattice decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"A pipelined scalable high-throughput implementation of a near-ML K-best complex lattice decoder","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518324/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518324/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973666","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pipelined scalable high-throughput implementation of a near-ML K-best complex lattice decoder","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00803.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042671S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4518325,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Zhou Zhan","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Zhou Zhan","id":"37574114000"},{"name":"Xin-Yu Shih","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Xin-Yu Shih","id":"37571437200"},{"name":"An-Yeu Wu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"An-Yeu Wu","id":"37271932500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518325","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new scheduling algorithm for the overlapped message passing decoding, which can be applied to general low-density parity check (LDPC) codes.

Based on the properties of the parity check matrix of LDPC codes, the updating calculation of the CNU and BNU can be overlapped to reduce the decoding latency by enhancing the HUE with the matrix scheduling algorithm.

In our scheme we use locally optimal (LO) detection rule in conjunction with maximum entropy method (MEM) for probability density function (PDF) estimation of the observation noise. We utilize MEM based on moment generating function (MGF) constraints instead of moments, as a new criterion. The estimated PDF based on MEM-MGF is quite close to the true PDF and yields better uniform approximation, especially in the tail of PDF. The results indicate that the new nonlinear detector outperforms conventional matched filter, and approaches the optimal receiver when desired signal is weak. For the new detector, there is no need for any signal level estimation, which is a computational burden when these parameters are time varying.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518329.pdf","startPage":"3193","endPage":"3196","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weak BPSK signal detection in the presence of cochannel interference with time varying characteristics using maximum entropy principle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Binary phase shift keying","Signal detection","Interchannel interference","Entropy","Detectors","Additive white noise","AWGN","Time varying systems","Probability density function","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","cochannel interference","entropy","phase shift keying","probability","signal detection","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","maximum entropy method","additive white Gaussian noise","nonlinear signal detector","binary phase shift keying","observation noise","probability density function","time varying parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum entropy method","Cochannel interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Weak BPSK signal detection in the presence of cochannel interference with time varying characteristics using maximum entropy principle","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518329/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973671","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weak BPSK signal detection in the presence of cochannel interference with time varying characteristics using maximum entropy principle","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00808.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038769S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4518330,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo Merched","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Merched","id":"37284777500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518330","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518330","abstract":"High Doppler effects resulting from fast time varying dispersive channels represent the most critical impairment to channel equalization techniques in block transmissions. In multicarrier systems, it gives rise to the so-called intercarrier interference (ICI), whose modeling for correct data recovery is paramount. Considering a practical scenario where the designer has no control on the transmitter side, we present a novel turbo equalization scheme based on recent frameworks for the time varying channel parametrization via its derivatives. This includes a fast method for estimating the channel derivatives running on a decision-directed turbo equalization scheme that can be implemented at either symbol or bit level. Unlike recent approaches, the derivatives estimation is adaptive, in the sense that at each turbo estimation it incorporates information on previously estimated parameters.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"3197","endPage":"3200","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518330.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo equalization in high doppler mobile environments: Channel estimation, fast algorithms and adaptive solutions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive equalizers","Channel estimation","OFDM","Parameter estimation","Interference","Decision feedback equalizers","Digital video broadcasting","Mobile computing","Doppler effect","Dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","dispersive channels","Doppler effect","equalisers","intercarrier interference","mobile radio","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo equalization","Doppler mobile environment","channel estimation","fast time varying dispersive channel","multicarrier system","intercarrier interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","fast channel estimation","equalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Turbo equalization in high doppler mobile environments: Channel estimation, fast algorithms and adaptive solutions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518330/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518330/","accessionNumber":"9973672","publicationDate":"March 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo equalization in high doppler mobile environments: Channel estimation, fast algorithms and adaptive solutions","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00809.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064578S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4518332,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

We consider spline approximation of the channel gain time variations and compare the detection performance of mismatched detectors using maximum likelihood channel estimates with the optimal one.

It will be shown that the ML detector performs pseudo correlation (F.D. Neeser et al.,1993) as well as conventional correlation of the observation to the signals-of-interest. As an alternative solution, we will propose a filter for converting improper signals to proper ones, called circularization filter, and will utilize it together with a conventional matched-filter (MF) to construct an ML detector.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518333.pdf","startPage":"3209","endPage":"3212","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum likelihood binary detection in improper complex gaussian noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood detection","Gaussian noise","Additive noise","Signal detection","Random variables","Detectors","Matched filters","Interference","Multiaccess communication","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","Gaussian noise","interference (signal)","matched filters","maximum likelihood detection","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood detection","improper complex Gaussian noise","communication systems","DS-CDMA systems","OFDM systems","circularly symmetric interfering signal","binary signals","additive Gaussian noise","complex random variables","decision rule","pseudocorrelation","circularization filter","matched-filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circularization","Gaussian noise","improper complex","matched filters","maximum likelihood detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood binary detection in improper complex gaussian noise","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518333/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973675","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood binary detection in improper complex gaussian noise","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00812.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057015S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4518335,"authors":[{"name":"Wessam Mesbah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Wessam","lastName":"Mesbah","id":"37392290200"},{"name":"Timothy N.

The proposed algorithm, aiming to maximize the signal to multiuser interference plus noise ratio (SINR), is referred to as SINR-Max cooperative beamforming. In this paper, we extend the application of SINR-Max cooperative beamforming to frequency selective block invariant channels by combining orthogonal frequency division multiplexing technique into MIMO systems (MIMO- OFDM). We designed two alternative transmitter structures with pre-IDFT beamforming in the frequency domain and post-IDFT beamforming in the time domain respectively, and the receiver structure common to both types of transmitters. For post-IDFT transmitter, we investigated different implementation options. Performance of the designed systems with different schemes is evaluated and compared through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518340","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518340.pdf","startPage":"3237","endPage":"3240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SINR-Max cooperative beamforming for multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518340/","displayDocTitle":"SINR-Max cooperative beamforming for multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973682","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518340/","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SINR-Max cooperative beamforming for multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00819.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054664S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4518343,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed F.

To alleviate these compromises, a new approach has recently been proposed, in which two filters with complementary capabilities adaptively mix their outputs to get an overall filter of improved performance. Following this approach, we propose a new normalized rule for adapting the mixing parameter that controls the combination. The new update rule preserves the good features of the existing scheme and is more robust to changes in the filtering scenario, for instance when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is time varying. The benefits of the normalized scheme are illustrated analytically and with a number of experiments in both stationary and tracking situations.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518356","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518356.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518356","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","startPage":"3301","endPage":"3304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A normalized adaptation scheme for the convex combination of two adaptive filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"A normalized adaptation scheme for the convex combination of two adaptive filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518356/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518356/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973698","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A normalized adaptation scheme for the convex combination of two adaptive filters","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00835.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086656S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4518357,"authors":[{"name":"Habib Senol","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kadir Has University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Habib","lastName":"Senol","id":"38246448800"},{"name":"Cihan Tepedelenlioglu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Cihan","lastName":"Tepedelenlioglu","id":"38228968600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518357","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518357","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Channel estimation","Sensor fusion","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Additive noise","Gaussian noise","Performance loss","Degradation","Statistics","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel estimation","Rayleigh channels","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed channel estimation error","parallel orthogonal flat Rayleigh fading channels","additive Gaussian noise channel","sensor fusion","source estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensor Networks","Distributed Estimation","Fading Channels","Channel Estimation"]}],"abstract":"We consider distributed estimation of a source observed by sensors in additive Gaussian noise, where the sensors are connected to a fusion center with unknown orthogonal (parallel) flat Rayleigh fading channels.

We prove that allocating half the total power into training is optimal, and show that compared to the perfect channel case, a performance loss of at least 6 dB is incurred. In addition, we show that unlike the perfect channel case, increasing the number of sensors will lead to an eventual degradation in performance.

The results in the literature have focused on the asymptotics of how many samples are required and the probability of making an error for & fixed batch of samples. We investigate an alternative scenario where observations are available in sequence and can be stopped as soon as there is reasonable certainty of correct reconstruction. This approach does not require knowing how sparse is the signal, and allows reconstruction using the smallest number of samples. Central to our sequential approach is the stopping rule. For the random Gaussian ensemble we show that a simple stopping rule gives the absolute minimum number of observations required for exact recovery, with probability one. However, for other ensembles like Bernoulli or Fourier, this is no longer true, and the rule is modified to trade off delay in stopping and probability of error. We also consider near-sparse signals and describe how to estimate the reconstruction error from the sequence of solutions. This enables stopping once the error falls below a desired tolerance. Our sequential approach to compressed sensing involves a sequence of linear programs, and we outline how such a sequence can be solved efficiently.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518370.pdf","startPage":"3357","endPage":"3360","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing with sequential observations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Decoding","Delay","Pursuit algorithms","Costs","Signal analysis","Guidelines","Military computing","Gaussian noise","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","Gaussian processes","random processes","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","sparse signals recovery","error probability","sequential approach","random Gaussian ensemble","near-sparse signals","reconstruction error","linear programs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sequential compressed sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing with sequential observations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518370/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973712","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing with sequential observations","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097991S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4518371,"authors":[{"name":"Petros T.

An alternative implicit sampling model is to record the timing of pre-determined level crossings. Thus the signal dictates the sampling times but not the sampling levels. Logan's theorem provides sufficient conditions for a signal to be recoverable, within a scaling factor, from only the timing of its zero crossings. Unfortunately, recovery from noisy observations of the timings is not robust and usually fails to reproduce the original signal. To make the reconstruction robust this paper introduces the additional assumption that the signal is sparse in some basis. We reformulate the reconstruction problem as a minimization of a sparsity inducing cost function on the unit sphere and provide an algorithm to compute the solution. While the problem is not convex, simulation studies indicate that the algorithm converges in typical cases and produces the correct solution with very high probability.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Sampling methods","Signal sampling","Signal processing","Hardware","Sufficient conditions","Noise robustness","Signal representations","Signal design","Multidimensional systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse signal reconstruction","classical sampling records","alternative implicit sampling model","predetermined level crossings","scaling factor","cost function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Level-crossing problems","implicit sampling","sparse reconstruction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518371","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518371.pdf","startPage":"3361","endPage":"3364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstructing sparse signals from their zero crossings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reconstructing sparse signals from their zero crossings","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518371/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518371/","accessionNumber":"9973713","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstructing sparse signals from their zero crossings","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00850.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044528S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4518372,"authors":[{"name":"Moshe Mishali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"lastName":"Moshe Mishali","id":"37393330300"},{"name":"Yonina C.

Our scheme guarantees exact recovery for a wide class of multi-band signals without the use of heuristics or discretization methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518372","startPage":"3365","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518372.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518372","endPage":"3368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum-blind reconstruction of multi-band signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum-blind reconstruction of multi-band signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518372/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9973714","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum-blind reconstruction of multi-band signals","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00851.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046842S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4518373,"authors":[{"name":"Thong T.

All currently existing methods only have at most three out of these four highly desired features.

To assure that the problem is well defined, i.e., that the solution is unique the vector of unknowns is of course assumed to be sparse. Nonetheless, even when the solution is unique, finding it in general may be computationally difficult. However, starting with the seminal work of Candes and Tao [2005], it has been shown that linear programming techniques, obtained from an l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-norm relaxation of the original non-convex problem, can provably find the unknown vector in certain instances. In particular, using a certain restricted isometry property, Candes and Tao [2005] shows that for measurement matrices chosen from a random Gaussian ensemble, l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n optimization can find the correct solution with overwhelming probability even when the number of non-zero entries of the unknown vector is proportional to the number of measurements (and the total number of unknowns). The subsequent paper [Donoho and Tanner, 2005] uses results on neighborly polytopes from [Vershik and Sporyshev, 1992] to give a \"sharp\" bound on what this proportionality should be in the Gaussian case. In the current paper, we observe that what matters is not so much the distribution from which the entries of the measurement matrix A are drawn, but rather the statistics of the null-space of A. Using this observation, we provide an alternative proof of the main result of Candes and Tao [2005] by analyzing matrices whose null-space is isotropic (of which i.i.d. Gaussian ensembles are a special case).","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518375","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518375.pdf","startPage":"3377","endPage":"3380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing - probabilistic analysis of a null-space characterization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518375/","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing - probabilistic analysis of a null-space characterization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973717","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518375/","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing - probabilistic analysis of a null-space characterization","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00854.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082589S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4518378,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael E.

In the past work the number of BEM coefficients used to model the doubly-selective channels for channel estimation has been based on an upperbound on the channel Doppler spread. Higher the Doppler spread, more the number of BEM coefficients leading to higher channel estimation variance. In this paper we propose to use a multiple model framework where several candidate Doppler spread values are used to cover the range from zero to an upperbound, leading to multiple CE-BEM channel models, each corresponding to an assumed value of the Doppler spread. Subsequently the well- known interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm is used for symbol detection based on multiple state-space models corresponding to the multiple estimated channels. A simulation example is presented to illustrate the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","startPage":"3473","endPage":"3476","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518399.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiple model approach to doubly-selective channel estimation using exponential basis models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","State estimation","Frequency","Bit error rate","Polynomials","Vectors","Finite impulse response filter","Time-varying channels","Time factors","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","Doppler broadening","fading channels","probability","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple model approach","doubly-selective channel estimation","exponential basis models","adaptive channel estimation","over-sampled complex exponential basis expansion model","BEM coefficients","channel Doppler spread","CE-BEM channel models","interacting multiple model","symbol detection","multiple state-space models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doubly-selective channels","adaptive channel estimation","basis expansion models","IMM algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"A multiple model approach to doubly-selective channel estimation using exponential basis models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518399/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518399/","accessionNumber":"9973741","publicationDate":"March 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiple model approach to doubly-selective channel estimation using exponential basis models","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00878.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051849S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":4518403,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Numerical simulations are conducted to compare the performance of the ML estimator against those of the conventional estimator of moments. Finally, a multiresolution multivariate gamma based modeling of Internet traffic illustrates the potential interest of the proposed distributions for the detection of anomalies. Aggregated times series of IP packet counts are split into adjacent non overlapping time blocks. The distribution of the resulting time series are modeled by the proposed multivariate gamma based distributions, over a collection of different aggregation levels. The anomaly detection strategy is based on tracking changes along time of the corresponding multiresolution parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518403.pdf","startPage":"3489","endPage":"3492","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter estimation for sums of correlated gamma random variables.

Under some assumptions that are considered realistic for sparse or high-contrast signals, the criterion is that the true source signals can be perfectly recovered by finding the extreme points of some observation-constructed convex set. In our last work we also developed methods for fulfilling the CAMNS criterion, but only for two to three sources. In this paper we propose a systematic linear programming (LP) based method that is applicable to any number of sources. The proposed method has two advantages. First, its dependence on LP means that the method does not suffer from local minima. Second, the maturity of LP solvers enables efficient implementation of the proposed method in practice. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518404","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518404.pdf","startPage":"3493","endPage":"3496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind separation of non-negative sources by convex analysis: Effective method using linear programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518404","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518404/","displayDocTitle":"Blind separation of non-negative sources by convex analysis: Effective method using linear programming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973746","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518404/","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind separation of non-negative sources by convex analysis: Effective method using linear programming","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00883.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061978S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4518412,"authors":[{"name":"Li Chai","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Contro, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Li Chai","id":"37858758300"},{"name":"Jingxin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"],"lastName":"Jingxin Zhang","id":"37087271875"},{"name":"Cishen Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Cishen Zhang","id":"37087269251"},{"name":"Edoardo Mosca","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Sistemi e Informatica, University\u00e3 di Firenze, Italy"],"lastName":"Edoardo Mosca","id":"37087745280"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518412","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518412","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Signal processing algorithms","Finite impulse response filter","Algorithm design and analysis","Approximation algorithms","IIR filters","Automatic generation control","Systems engineering and theory","Frequency","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","optimisation","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frame-bound-ratio","oversampled filter banks","perfect reconstruction","subband filter","finite convex optimization algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Oversampled filter banks","frame bounds","convex optimization","linear matrix inequality"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a simple method to improve the frame-bounds-ratio of perfect reconstruction (PR) oversampled filter banks (FBs) by adjusting the gain of each subband filter.

Interestingly, if the rank of the form is not a function of the problem size, then it can be maximized in polynomial time. An algorithm for the efficient computation of the binary vector that maximizes a rank-deficient quadratic form is developed based on an analytic procedure. Auxiliary spherical coordinates are introduced and the multi-dimensional space is partitioned into a polynomial-size set of regions; each region corresponds to a distinct binary vector. The binary vector that maximizes the rank-deficient quadratic form is shown to belong to the polynomial-size set of candidate vectors. Thus, the size of the feasible set is efficiently reduced from exponential to polynomial.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient computation of the binary vector that maximizes a rank-deficient quadratic form","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518425","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518425.pdf","startPage":"3577","endPage":"3580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient computation of the binary vector that maximizes a rank-deficient quadratic form","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518425/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973767","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient computation of the binary vector that maximizes a rank-deficient quadratic form","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00904.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083015S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4518427,"authors":[{"name":"Marwan A.

We focus on offset quadrature phase shift keying (OQPSK) waveform band-limited by a square root raised cosine (SRRC) filter. This is one of the waveforms used in wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA) wireless standard. We show that the PA output PSD obtained by our analytical analysis matches well the simulated PSD. Furthermore, we compare the PA output PSD of QPSK and OQPSK waveforms as a function of the SRRC filter roll-off. We conclude that for small roll-off, both QPSK and OQPSK experience almost the same level of spectral re-growth. As the roll-off increases, OQPSK becomes less sensitive to PA nonlinearity relative to QPSK.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518429","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518429.pdf","startPage":"3593","endPage":"3596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral regrowth analysis of band-limited offset-QPSK","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518429/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral regrowth analysis of band-limited offset-QPSK","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973771","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518429/","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral regrowth analysis of band-limited offset-QPSK","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00908.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066634S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518430,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Chao Wang","id":"38259169500"},{"name":"Shu Hung Leung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Shu Hung Leung","id":"37265751900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518430","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM modulation","Constraint optimization","Transmitters","Iterative algorithms","Computational complexity","Frequency domain analysis","Chaos","Power engineering and energy","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","convex programming","error statistics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAR reduction","OFDM","convex programming","high peak-to-average power ratio","power efficient transmitter","active constellation extension","bit-error-rate","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Newton method","optimization methods","iterative methods","power control"]}],"abstract":"The high peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) encountered in OFDM system has been a major obstacle in the implementation of power efficient transmitter.

The structure is based on compressed sensing (CS) that exploits the sparsity of frequency utilization. Specifically, the received analog signal is segmented or time-windowed and CS is applied to each segment independently using an analog implementation of the inner product, then all the samples are processed together to reconstruct the signal. Applying the CS framework to the analog signal directly relaxes the requirements in wideband RF receiver front-ends. Moreover, the parallel structure provides a design flexibility and scalability on the sensing rate and system complexity. This paper also provides a joint reconstruction algorithm that optimally detects the information symbols from the sub-Nyquist analog projection coefficients.

A small number of random projection measurements from the received analog signal would suffice to provide salient information for signal detection. However, the compressive measure ments are not efficient at gathering signal energy. In this paper, a set of detectors called subspace compressive detectors are proposed where a more efficient detection scheme can be constructed by exploiting the sparsity model of the underlying signal. Furthermore, we show that the signal sparsity model can be approximately estimated using reconstruction algorithms with very limited random measurements on the training signals. Based on the estimated signal sparsity model, an effective subspace random measurement matrix can be designed for unknown signal detection, which significantly reduces the necessary number of measurements. The performance of the subspace compressive detectors is analyzed. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed subspace compressive detectors.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Detectors","Compressed sensing","Sampling methods","Energy measurement","Collaborative work","Government","Matching pursuit algorithms","Pursuit algorithms","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","estimation theory","matrix algebra","signal detection","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subspace compressive detection","sparse signals","compressed sensing","universal signal detection","random projection measurements","signal sparsity model","reconstruction algorithms","subspace random measurement matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Subspace","compressed sensing","detection"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518499","startPage":"3873","endPage":"3876","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518499.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace compressive detection for sparse signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Subspace compressive detection for sparse signals","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9973841","publicationDate":"March 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518499/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace compressive detection for sparse signals","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-00978.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078503S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4518501,"authors":[{"name":"G.

We establish an important connection between the inverse problem that arises in overcomplete representations and wireless communication models in network information theory. We show that the stable recovery of a sparse solution with a single measurement vector (SMV) can be viewed as decoding competing users simultaneously transmitting messages through a multiple access channel (MAC) at the same rate. With multiple measurement vectors (MMV), we relate the inverse problem to the wireless communication scenario with a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. In each case, based on the connection established between the two domains, we leverage channel capacity results with outage analysis to shed light on the fundamental limits of any algorithm to stably recover sparse solutions in the presence of noise.

A proof-of-concept system for synthesising DCT parameters is evaluated, showing that the benefits do not come at the expense of speech synthesis applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518524.pdf","startPage":"3973","endPage":"3976","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling and synthesising F0 contours with the discrete cosine transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Speech synthesis","Statistical analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Computer science","Training data","Natural languages","Event detection","Time measurement","Extraterrestrial measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","speech synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transform","speech fundamental frequency contours","deterministic algorithms","proof-of-concept system","speech synthesis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Cosine Transform","speech processing","speech synthesis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Modelling and synthesising F0 contours with the discrete cosine transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518524/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973866","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling and synthesising F0 contours with the discrete cosine transform","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-01003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070056S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518528,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Qiao","affiliation":["Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Yu Qiao","id":"37087184664"},{"name":"Naoya Shimomura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Naoya Shimomura","id":"37087743102"},{"name":"Nobuaki Minematsu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Nobuaki Minematsu","id":"37087177977"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518528","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":524},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518528","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rate-distortion","Clustering algorithms","Speech recognition","Speech synthesis","Statistical analysis","Error analysis","Information theory","Information analysis","Information rates","Acoustic distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability","speech processing","speech recognition","speech synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised optimal phoneme segmentation","speech recognition","speech synthesis","probabilistic framework","summation of square error","log determinant","rate distortion","information rate distortion theory","human signal perception mechanism","time-constrained agglomerative clustering algorithm","integration functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unsupervised phoneme segmentation","Rate Distortion theory","Agglomerative clustering"]}],"abstract":"Phoneme segmentation is a fundamental problem in many speech recognition and synthesis studies. Unsupervised phoneme segmentation assumes no knowledge on linguistic contents and acoustic models, and thus poses a challenging problem. The essential question here is what is the optimal segmentation. This paper formulates the optimal segmentation problem into a probabilistic framework. Using statistics and information theory analysis, we develop three different objective functions, namely, summation of square error (SSE), log determinant (LD) and rate distortion (RD). Specially, RD function is derived from information rate distortion theory and can be related to human signal perception mechanism. We introduce a time-constrained agglomerative clustering algorithm to find the optimal segmentations. We also propose an efficient method to implement the algorithm by using integration functions. We carry out experiments on TIMIT database to compare the above three objective functions. The results show that rate distortion achieves the best performance and indicate that our method outperforms the recently published unsupervised segmentation methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518528","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518528.pdf","startPage":"3989","endPage":"3992","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised optimal phoneme segmentation: Objectives, algorithm and comparisons","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised optimal phoneme segmentation: Objectives, algorithm and comparisons","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518528/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973870","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518528/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised optimal phoneme segmentation: Objectives, algorithm and comparisons","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-01007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046852S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4518538,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin W.

The noise variance in the new algorithm contains a significant term resulting from instantaneous phase asynchrony between clean speech and mixing noise, missing in the E&M algorithm. Speech recognition experiments on the standard Aurora-3 task demonstrate a reduction of word error rate by 48% against the ICSLP02 baseline, by 26% against the cepstral mean normalization baseline, and by 13% against the conventional E&M log-MMSE noise suppressor. The new algorithm is also much more efficient than E&M noise suppressor since the number of the channels in the Mel-frequency filter bank is much smaller (23 in our case) than the number of bins in the FFT domain (256).

The hallmark of our new approach is the use of a nonlinear, phase-sensitive model of acoustic distortion that captures phase asynchrony between clean speech and the mixing noise. In the first step of the developed algorithm, both the static and dynamic portions of the noise and channel parameters are estimated in the cepstral domain, using the speech recognizer's \"feedback\" information and the vector-Taylor-series linearization technique on the nonlinear phase-sensitive model. In the second step, the estimated noise and channel parameters are used to effectively adapt the static and dynamic portions of the HMM means and variances also using the linearized phase-sensitive acoustic distortion model. In the experimental evaluation using the standard Aurora 2 task, the proposed new algorithm achieves 93.3% accuracy using the clean-trained complex HMM backend as the baseline system for unsupervised HMM adaptation. This reaches the highest performance number in the literature on this task with clean-trained HMM model. The experimental results show that the phase term, which was missing in all previous HMM-adaptation work, contributes significantly to the achieved high recognition accuracy.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518548.pdf","startPage":"4069","endPage":"4072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HMM adaptation using a phase-sensitive acoustic distortion model for environment-robust speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518548","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"HMM adaptation using a phase-sensitive acoustic distortion model for environment-robust speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9973890","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4518548/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HMM adaptation using a phase-sensitive acoustic distortion model for environment-robust speech recognition","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-01027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051064S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4518550,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Cui","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

We investigate various features, with a focus on high-precision performance for use in the detector, and examine performance results on a subset of the AMI Meeting Corpus. For the high-quality signal case of a single mixed-headset channel signal, we demonstrate a relative improvement of about 7.4% DER over the baseline diarization system, while for the more challenging case of the single far-field channel signal relative improvement is 3.6%. We also outline steps towards improvement and moving beyond this initial phase.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal

hierarchical functionals for paralinguistics: A waste of feature space?","abstract":"While the \" 'quasi-state-of-the-art'\" towards acoustic emotion recognition relies on multivariate time-series analysis of e.g. pitch, energy, or MFCC by statistical functionals as moments or extrema, only few respect statistical noise by outliers due to too long segments as turns. Such noise can be overcome by hierarchical functionals as means of extrema over smaller units as words or chunks. Segmentation of such units however usually relies on transcription. We therefore discuss hierarchical functionals based on automatic segmentation and their systematic generation as opposed to common expert-driven selection. To cope with rapidly growing feature spaces iquest5k, we discuss data-driven two-stage compression based on SVM- SFFS. Extensive test-runs are carried out on two known emotion and behavior corpora, and show superiority of the suggested approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518656/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9973998","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518656/","publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Brute-forcing hierarchical functionals for paralinguistics: A waste of feature space?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brute-forcing hierarchical functionals for paralinguistics: A waste of feature space?","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-01135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054227S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4518670,"authors":[{"name":"John R.

Several of these, such as the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the Bhattacharyya divergence, are tractable for simple distributions such as Gaussians, but are intractable for more complex distributions such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) used in speech recognizers. For tasks related to classification error, the Bhattacharyya divergence is of special importance, due to its relationship with the Bayes error. Here we derive novel variational approximations to the Bhattacharyya divergence for HMMs. Remarkably the variational Bhattacharyya divergence can be computed in a simple closed-form expression for a given sequence length. One of the approximations can even be integrated over all possible sequence lengths in a closed-form expression. We apply the variational Bhattacharyya divergence for HMMs to word confusability, the problem of estimating the probability of mistaking one spoken word for another.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518670.pdf","startPage":"4557","endPage":"4560","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variational Bhattacharyya divergence for hidden Markov models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Gaussian distribution","Closed-form solution","Gaussian processes","Probability distribution","Speech recognition","Probability density function","Statistical distributions","Density measurement","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","hidden Markov models","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variational Bhattacharyya divergence","probability distributions","Kullback-Leibler divergence","hidden Markov models","speech recognizers","Bayes error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bhattacharyya Error","Bhattacharyya divergence","variational methods","Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)","hidden Markov models (HMMs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518670/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Variational Bhattacharyya divergence for hidden Markov models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518670/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9974012","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variational Bhattacharyya divergence for hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-01149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051041S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518676,"authors":[{"name":"Randy Gomez","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Randy","lastName":"Gomez","id":"37979526500"},{"name":"Jani Even","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Jani","lastName":"Even","id":"37294742400"},{"name":"Hiroshi Saruwatari","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan"],"lastName":"Hiroshi Saruwatari","id":"37284587900"},{"name":"Kiyohiro Shikano","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan"],"lastName":"Kiyohiro Shikano","id":"37284589100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518676","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":232},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Speech recognition","Reflection","Reverberation","Linear predictive coding","Information science","Estimation error","Microphones","Degradation","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic wave reflection","reverberation","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distant-talking robust speech recognition","room impulse response","dereverberation technique","spectral subtraction","reverberant signal","multiband coefficients","microphone locations","late reflection components"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Robustness","Speech Recognition","Dereverberation","Spectral Subtraction"]}],"abstract":"We propose a robust and fast dereverberation technique for real-time speech recognition application. First, we effectively identify the late reflection components of the room impulse response. We use this information together with the concept of spectral subtraction (SS) to remove the late reflection components of the reverberant signal. In the absence of the clean speech in actual scenario, approximation is carried out in estimating the late reflection where the estimation error is corrected through multi-band SS. The multi-band coefficients are optimized during offline training and used in the actual online dereverberation. The proposed method performs better and faster than the relevant approach using multi-LPC and reverberant matched model.

Recent statistical approaches, such as conditional random fields, rely on well chosen feature functions to ensure that important characteristics of the empirical training distribution are reflected in the trained model. In practice, however, it is not always clear how to best select these feature functions in order to obtain a suitably robust model. This paper proposes an alternative strategy based on the principle of latent analogy. For each sentence under consideration, we construct a neighborhood of globally relevant training sentences through an appropriate data-driven mapping of the input surface form. Tagging then proceeds via locally optimal sequence alignment and maximum likelihood position scoring. Empirical evidence shows that this solution is competitive with state-of-the-art Markovian techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518702","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518702.pdf","startPage":"4685","endPage":"4688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach to part-of-speech tagging based on latent analogy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518702/","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach to part-of-speech tagging based on latent analogy","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9974044","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518702/","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach to part-of-speech tagging based on latent analogy","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-01181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054243S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4518710,"authors":[{"name":"Donglai Zhu","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"lastName":"Donglai Zhu","id":"37399202900"},{"name":"Qiang Huo","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Qiang Huo","id":"37067063200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518710","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Robustness","Speech recognition","Automatic speech recognition","Training data","Support vector machines","Gaussian distribution","Asia","Electronic mail","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","maximum likelihood estimation","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["irrelevant variability normalization","HMM training","hidden Markov model","MAP estimation","feature transforms","robust speech recognition","phonetic classification","maximum likelihood training","frame-dependent linear transformation","maximum a posteriori","Finnish Aurora3 database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["robust speech recognition","feature transformation","MAP estimate","hidden Markov model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518710.pdf","startPage":"4717","endPage":"4720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Irrelevant variability normalization based HMM training using map estimation of feature transforms for robust speech recognition","abstract":"In the past several years, we've been studying feature transformation (FT) approaches to robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) which can compensate for possible \"distortions\" caused by factors irrelevant to phonetic classification in both training and recognition stages.

A five-layers MLP used in bottleneck feature extraction allows to obtain arbitrary feature size without dimensionality reduction by transforms, independently on the MLP training targets. The MLP topology - number and sizes of layers, suitable training targets, the impact of output feature transforms, the need of delta features, and the dimensionality of the final feature vector are studied with respect to the best ASR result. Optimized features are employed in three LVCSR tasks: Arabic broadcast news, English conversational telephone speech and English meetings. Improvements over standard cepstral features and probabilistic MLP features are shown for different tasks and different neural net input representations. A significant improvement is observed when phoneme MLP training targets are replaced by phoneme states and when delta features are added.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518713.pdf","startPage":"4729","endPage":"4732","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing bottle-neck features for lvcsr","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cepstral analysis","Automatic speech recognition","Principal component analysis","Feature extraction","Neural networks","Spectrogram","Topology","Decorrelation","Discrete cosine transforms","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cepstral analysis","feature extraction","multilayer perceptrons","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization","bottle-neck feature extraction","LVCSR","automatic speech recognition","ASR","MLP","multilayer perceptron","feature vector","Arabic broadcast news","English conversational telephone speech","English meetings","cepstral features","neural net","phoneme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bottle-neck","MLP structure","features","LVCSR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing bottle-neck features for lvcsr","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518713/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9974055","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing bottle-neck features for lvcsr","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-01192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045806S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518749,"authors":[{"name":"Jan S.

As in the cepstral domain coefficients that represent speech can be robustly determined, we can apply little smoothing to speech coefficients and strong smoothing to noise coefficients.

However, noise is almost always present in applications, and compressed sensing suffers from it. The signal to noise ratio per dimension using random projections is very poor, since sensing energy is equally distributed over all dimensions. Consequently, the ability of compressed sensing to locate sparse components degrades significantly as noise increases. It is possible, in principle, to improve performance by \"shaping\" the projections to focus sensing energy in proper dimensions. The main question addressed here is, can projections be adaptively shaped to achieve this focusing effect? The answer is yes, and we demonstrate a simple, computationally efficient procedure that does so.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518814.pdf","startPage":"5133","endPage":"5136","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finding needles in noisy haystacks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Needles","Compressed sensing","Signal to noise ratio","Degradation","Signal sampling","Noise level","Sampling methods","Extraterrestrial measurements","Noise measurement","Noise shaping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal denoising","signal detection","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noisy haystacks","compressed sensing","random projections","sparse signals","high-dimensional spaces","signal to noise ratio","focusing effect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sparse approximation","compressed sensing","reconstruction","adaptive sampling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Finding needles in noisy haystacks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518814/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9974155","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finding needles in noisy haystacks","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-01293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048909S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4518815,"authors":[{"name":"Marco F.

Thus, we have a set of sparse signals with both some common parts, and some variations. The question is how to acquire such signals and how to reconstruct them perfectly (noiseless case) or approximately (noisy case). We propose an extension of the annihilating filter method [3] to this distributed scenario. We model the inter-relation between the sparse signals by introducing three joint sparse models. For each model, we propose sensing and reconstruction algorithms that reduce the number of measurements below the limit for the single sensor scenario and results in power and bandwidth reduction in the system. In the noiseless scenario, we are close to the minimum number of measurements possible for the perfect reconstruction while by taking more measurements, we introduce redundancy in the system to effectively mitigate the noise. Simulation results justify the applicability of the approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed compressed sensing: Sparsity models and reconstruction algorithms using annihilating filter","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518816","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518816.pdf","startPage":"5141","endPage":"5144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed compressed sensing: Sparsity models and reconstruction algorithms using annihilating filter","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518816/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9974157","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed compressed sensing: Sparsity models and reconstruction algorithms using annihilating filter","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-01295.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092153S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4518823,"authors":[{"name":"Mathias Ortner","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Mathias","lastName":"Ortner","id":"37547094600"},{"name":"Arye Nehorai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Arye","lastName":"Nehorai","id":"37265777100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518823","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pollution measurement","Sensor arrays","Dispersion","Numerical simulation","Monitoring","Decontamination","Clouds","Biosensors","Predictive models","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biosensors","chemical sensors","decontamination","diffusion","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemical transport","realistic environments","environmental monitoring","decontamination","biochemical sensors","statistical analysis","chemical diffusion","Feynmann-Kac formula","multiple dispersive sources"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array signal processing","biochemical diffusion","Feynmann-Kac formula","Bayesian estimation","Sequential detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518823","abstract":"Simulation, detection and estimation of the spread of a biochemical substance are key elements in environmental monitoring.

Broadly categorized based on their level of invasiveness, BMIs relying on implantable microelectrode arrays (MEAs) have received the most attention.

Many STD systems use the output of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system which has a limited and fixed vocabulary, and are not capable of detecting rare words of high information content, such as named entities. Since such words are often of great interest for a retrieval task it is important to index spoken archives in a way that allows a user to search an OOV query/term.1 In this work, we employ hybrid recognition systems which contain both words and subword units (graphones) to generate hybrid lattice indexes. We use a word-based STD system as our baseline, and present improvements by employing our proposed hybrid STD system that uses words plus graphones on the English broadcast news genre of the 2006 NIST STD task.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518841","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518841.pdf","startPage":"5240","endPage":"5243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open-vocabulary spoken term detection using graphone-based hybrid recognition systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518841","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518841/","displayDocTitle":"Open-vocabulary spoken term detection using graphone-based hybrid recognition systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9974182","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518841/","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open-vocabulary spoken term detection using graphone-based hybrid recognition systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-01320.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044521S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4518845,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For room audio conferencing, a circular array using modal beamforming is potentially attractive since it allows a single or multiple beams to be steered to any angle in the plane of the array while maintaining a desired beampattern. One potential problem with circular arrays is that they do not allow the designer to have control of the spatial response of the array in directions that are normal to the array. In this paper we propose an augmented circular microphone array that allows one to have some control of the vertical spatial response of the array. A second-order system was built and measured.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518851","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518851.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518851","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","startPage":"5280","endPage":"5283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spherical harmonic modal beamforming for an augmented circular microphone array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Spherical harmonic modal beamforming for an augmented circular microphone array","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518851/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518851/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9974192","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spherical harmonic modal beamforming for an augmented circular microphone array","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-01330.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040226S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4518852,"authors":[{"name":"Adam O'Donovan","affiliation":["Perceptual Interfaces & Reality Lab., Univ. of Maryland, College Park"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"O'Donovan","id":"37945032900"},{"name":"Ramani Duraiswami","affiliation":["Perceptual Interfaces & Reality Lab., Univ. of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Ramani","lastName":"Duraiswami","id":"37274487700"},{"name":"Dmitry Zotkin","affiliation":["Perceptual Interfaces & Reality Lab., Univ. of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Dmitry","lastName":"Zotkin","id":"37274513200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518852","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":376},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518852","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic imaging","Cameras","Microphone arrays","Acoustic scattering","Raman scattering","Acoustic measurements","Humans","Educational institutions","Layout","Reverberation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic measurement","acoustic signal processing","audio signal processing","computer vision","image registration","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imaging concert hall acoustics","visual cameras","audio cameras","spherical microphone array beamformer","acoustic intensity images","acoustic measurement","panoramic mosaiced visual image","central projection","acquired audio registration","video image registration","computer vision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spherical microphone arrays","room acoustics","acoustical camera","acoustical scene analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518852","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518852.pdf","startPage":"5284","endPage":"5287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Imaging concert hall acoustics using visual and audio cameras","abstract":"Using a developed real time audio camera, that uses the output of a spherical microphone array beamformer steered in all directions to create central projection to create acoustic intensity images, we present a technique to measure the acoustics of rooms and halls.

Much of the receiver/protocol design for cooperative communications requires channel state information at the receiver. The proposed multichannel estimation algorithm exploits relationships between the multipath channels of cooperating transmitting nodes to a destination node. A simplified channel model is proposed from a geometry-based ray-tracing model. From an approximation of the channels between the relays and the destination, an iterative scheme is derived. The proposed method exploits the sparse nature of underwater acoustic channels and in so doing improves performance over unstructured methods. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated via simulations, i.e. comparing the mean-square error of the estimated channel with its Cramer-Rao bound.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE

for underwater acoustic communication recently. In this paper, we present a desirable property of OFDM that one signal design can be easily scaled to fit into different transmission bandwidths with negligible changes on the receiver. We have tested the proposed design with data collected from experiments at AUV Fest, Panama City, FL, June 2007, and at the Buzzards Bay, MA, Aug. 2007. With QPSK modulation, we have used different bandwidths from 3 kHz to 50 kHz, leading to data rates from 1.5 kbps to 25 kbps after rate 1/2 coding. With 16-QAM modulation, we have used different bandwidths from 12 kHz to 50 kHz, leading to data rates from 12 kbps to 50 kbps. Excellent BER performance has been achieved, which confirms the flexibility of OFDM under different system setups.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable OFDM design for underwater acoustic communications","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518857","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518857.pdf","startPage":"5304","endPage":"5307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Scalable OFDM design for underwater acoustic communications","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518857/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9974198","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable OFDM design for underwater acoustic communications","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-01336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124446S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4518860,"authors":[{"name":"Sasha Draganov","affiliation":["Argon ST"],"firstName":"Sasha","lastName":"Draganov","id":"38072887100"},{"name":"John Weinfield","affiliation":["Argon ST"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Weinfield","id":"38094097400"},{"name":"Lin Haas","affiliation":["Argon ST"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Haas","id":"37544865200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518860","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Global Positioning System","Radio navigation","Correlators","Antenna arrays","Radio frequency","Antenna measurements","Delay","Jamming","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","indoor radio","multipath channels","radionavigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse beamforming","multipath channel","indoor radionavigation","urban environment","signal strength","multipath mitigation method","pseudorange measurement","array signal processing","antenna arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Navigation","Array signal processing","Multipath channels","Land mobile radio propagation factors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518860","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518860","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","abstract":"Radionavigation in indoor and urban environments suffers from the effects of severe multipath and low signal strength.

This technique complements other multipath mitigation methods which receivers use to make pseudorange measurements. Inverse beamforming is based on array signal processing by the user; however, a user needs only a single antenna, and the array itself is housed by the beacon (hence the name). Thus, a mobile user is not required to carry a cumbersome antenna array while taking full advantage of array signal processing gains.

The applications have evolved from speaker-dependent name dialing, which require user enrollment of frequently dialed names, to speaker-independent capabilities including continuous digit dialing, command and control of phone functions, and name dialing directly from the phone's contacts directory. Recently available advances include capabilities like voice-enabled SMS, e-mail, and even mobile search with voice. This evolution has been enabled by advances in speech recognition robustness, network capabilities, and increased computational power in small devices. Systems may now be used in hands-busy/eyes-busy conditions including speakerphone and bluetooth scenarios. In this paper, we will provide an overview of embedded speech recognition centric applications in mobile phones, specifically focusing on current status, industry trends, and challenges in customer acceptance. Although voice interfaces are natural and attractive in theory, a majority of users do not use the voice-enabled features available in their mobile phones. We will discuss some of the reasons for this user behavior and recommend actions to be taken.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518869","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518869.pdf","startPage":"5352","endPage":"5355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518869","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded speech recognition applications in mobile phones: Status, trends, and challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Embedded speech recognition applications in mobile phones: Status, trends, and challenges","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518869/","publicationDate":"March 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9974209","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518869/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded speech recognition applications in mobile phones: Status, trends, and challenges","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-01348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049083S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4518871,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrie C.

Recently, it was shown that the rates at the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy are poor especially in the medium and high SNR regimes. A reasonable outcome of the cooperative approach, close to the Pareto boundary of the achievable rate region, was shown to be the zero-forcing (ZF) strategy. In this work, we prove that any point on the Pareto boundary can be achieved by a certain linear combination of the NE and ZF strategies. A scalar weight per user chooses between \"selfish\" (NE) and altruistic (ZF) behavior. Thereby, the difficult beamforming optimization is reduced to a simple weight optimization. Different optimal operating points, e.g. maximum weighted sum-rate, the Nash-bargaining solution, or the Egalitarian solution, can be obtained by a computationally efficient iterative algorithm. The results are characterized by instantaneous achievable rate regions and the corresponding operating points.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and

paper discusses the issue of dynamic resource allocation (DRA) in the context of cognitive radio (CR) networks. We present a general framework adopting generalized transmitter and receiver signal- expansion functions, which allow us to join DRA with waveform adaptation, two procedures that are currently carried out separately. Moreover, the proposed DRA can handle many types of expansion functions or even combinations of different types of functions. An iterative game approach is adopted to perform multi-player DRA, and the best-response strategies of players are derived and characterized using convex optimization. To reduce the implementation costs of having too many active expansion functions after optimization, we also propose to combine DRA with sparsity constraints for dynamic function selection. Generally, it incurs little rate-performance loss since the effective resources required by a CR are in fact sparse.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9974213","htmlLink":"/document/4518873/","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Joint dynamic resource allocation and waveform adaptation in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint dynamic resource allocation and waveform adaptation in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-01352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049379S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518875,"authors":[{"name":"Gesualdo Scutari","affiliation":["Department INFOCOM, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Gesualdo","lastName":"Scutari","id":"37269398400"},{"name":"Daniel P.

To derive decentralized solutions that do not require any cooperation among the systems, the optimization problem is formulated as a static noncooperative game. The analysis of the game for arbitrary MIMO interference channels is quite involved, since it requires the study of a set of nonlinear nondifferentiable matrix-valued equations, based on the MIMO waterfilling solution. To overcome this difficulty, we provide a new interpretation of the waterfilling operator, for the general MIMO multiuser case, as a matrix projection. This key result allows us to simplify the study of the game and to obtain sufficient conditions for both uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) and convergence of the proposed totally asynchronous distributed algorithms. The proposed approach provides a general framework that encompasses all previous works, mostly concerned with the particular case of SISO Gaussian frequency-selective interference channel.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518875","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518875.pdf","startPage":"5376","endPage":"5379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Competitive Design of Multiuser MIMO Interference Systems based on Game Theory: A Unified Framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518875/","displayDocTitle":"Competitive Design of Multiuser MIMO Interference Systems based on Game Theory: A Unified Framework","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9974215","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518875/","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Competitive Design of Multiuser MIMO Interference Systems based on Game Theory: A Unified Framework","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-05062008-01354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051212S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505270","isNumber":"4517521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505270","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4517521","articleId":"4518875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4518879,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-han Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, USA"],"lastName":"Chia-han Lee","id":"37423045400"},{"name":"Wayne Wolf","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Wayne","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37284351200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1483-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1484-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4518879","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518879","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Computer architecture","Physical layer","Blind source separation","Software radio","Interference","Multiuser detection","Frequency","Computational complexity","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","cognitive radio","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["functional architectures","cognitive radio systems","physical layer architecture","architectural design","complexity analysis","physical layer functions","physical layer systems","blind signal separation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","blind signal separation","multiuser detection","software radio","computational theory"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518879","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505270/4517521/04518879.pdf","startPage":"5392","endPage":"5395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4517521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of functional architectures for cognitive radio systems","abstract":"This paper proposes and compares two new physical layer architectures for cognitive radio.

Then, analytical comparisons of 2S-DIRK with the trapezoidal, backward Euler, and Gear-Shichman methods are carried out, and numerical examples which verify the analytical comparisons are shown.

The negative value of the ratio between the derivative of error and error is the input and the slope constant of the sliding surface of the nonchattering sliding-mode controller is the output of the fuzzy logic controller. Afterwards, a four-degree-of-freedom nonlinear half-car model, which allows wheel hops and includes a suspension system with nonlinear spring and piecewise linear damper with dry friction, is presented. The designed controllers are applied to this model in order to evaluate their performances. It has been shown that the designed controller does not cause any problem in suspension working limits. The robustness of the proposed controller is also investigated for different vehicle parameters.

Therefore, most approaches work only under restricted conditions such as fixed illumination, limited vehicle speed, designated routes, and stationary backgrounds. Numerous techniques have been developed for LPR in still images or video sequences, and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and assess them. Issues such as processing time, computational power, and recognition rate are also addressed, when available.

Since tolerable delay does not allow propagating global information back and forth throughout the multihop network to a centralized decision maker, the source nodes and relays need to adapt their actions (transmission frequency channel and route selections) in a distributed manner, based on local network information. We propose a distributed resource-management algorithm that allows network nodes to exchange information and that explicitly considers the delays and cost of exchanging the network information over multihop cognitive radio networks. In this paper, the term ldquocognitiverdquo refers to both the capability of the network nodes to achieve large spectral efficiencies by dynamically exploiting available frequency channels and their ability to learn the ldquoenvironmentrdquo (the actions of interfering nodes) based on the designed information exchange. Note that the node competition is due to the mutual interference of neighboring nodes using the same frequency channel. Based on this, we adopt a multiagent-learning approach, i.e., adaptive fictitious play, which uses the available interference information. We also discuss the tradeoff between the cost of the required information exchange and the learning efficiency. The results show that our distributed resource-management approach improves the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of multiple video streams by more than 3 dB, as opposed to the state-of-the-art dynamic frequency channel/route selection approaches without learning capability, when the network resources are limited.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518957/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 May 2008","volume":"58","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"10475160","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518957/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Resource Management in Multihop Cognitive Radio Networks for Delay-Sensitive Transmission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Resource Management in Multihop Cognitive Radio Networks for Delay-Sensitive Transmission","sourcePdf":"58tvt02-shiang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102934S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4783256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4783256","articleId":"4518957","onlineDate":"14 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4518958,"authors":[{"name":"Myeongcheol Shin","affiliation":["Telecommunication Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4783256/4518958/4518958-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Myeongcheol Shin received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2001, 2003, and 2008, respectively.","He is currently a Senior Engineer with the Telecommunication Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., Suwon, Korea.

Conventional multimode QP (MM-QP), however, does not consider the adaptive rate allocation among substreams; thus, it cannot have the additional gain by adaptive modulation. Furthermore, it is computationally complex since exhaustive matrix inversions are required to determine the optimal mode. In this paper, we propose an efficient MM-QP system that improves the performance of a conventional system in terms of error rate and has a lower computational complexity than the conventional system. First, we define the rate-partitioning vector as the mode and control the rate among substreams and the number of substreams according to the channel instantaneous condition. Second, to reduce the computational complexity for the receiver to determine the optimal mode, the simplified mode-selection technique using estimates of the modal metric is proposed. In the proposed mode-selection technique, the optimal mode can be obtained by several multiplication and division operations. Finally, the mode-reduction technique eliminating the less-frequently used modes is proposed, which leads to a significant reduction of the feedback information with negligible performance loss. In numerical experiments, it was verified that the proposed MM-QP system gives a better error-rate performance than the conventional system, with much less computational complexity for the same amount of feedback information.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.925303","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4783256/04518958.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.925303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783256","startPage":"733","endPage":"743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Multimode Quantized Precoding Technique for MIMO Wireless Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518958","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Multimode Quantized Precoding Technique for MIMO Wireless Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518958/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475157","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4518958/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Multimode Quantized Precoding Technique for MIMO Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"58tvt02-shin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071635S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4783256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4783256","articleId":"4518958","onlineDate":"14 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4518959,"authors":[{"name":"SuKyoung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4783256/4518959/4518959-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["SuKyoung Lee (M'04) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1992, 1995, and 2000, respectively.","From 2000 to 2003, she was with the Advanced Networking Technologies Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD.

A large variety of applications utilizing these networks will demand features such as real-time, high-availability, and even instantaneous high-bandwidth in some cases. Therefore, it is imperative for network service providers to make the best possible use of the combined resources of available heterogeneous networks (wireless area networks (WLANs), Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems, VANETs, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), etc.) for connection support. When connections need to migrate between heterogeneous networks for performance and high-availability reasons, seamless vertical handoff (VHO) is a necessary first step. In the near future, vehicular and other mobile applications will be expected to have seamless VHO between heterogeneous access networks. With regard to VHO performance, there is a critical need to develop algorithms for connection management and optimal resource allocation for seamless mobility. In this paper, we develop a VHO decision algorithm that enables a wireless access network to not only balance the overall load among all attachment points (e.g., base stations and access points) but also maximize the collective battery lifetime of mobile nodes (MNs). In addition, when ad hoc mode is applied to 3/4G wireless data networks, VANETs, and IEEE 802.11 WLANs for a more seamless integration of heterogeneous wireless networks, we devise a route-selection algorithm for forwarding data packets to the most appropriate attachment point to maximize collective battery lifetime and maintain load balancing. Results based on a detailed performance evaluation study are also presented here to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vertical Handoff Decision Algorithms for Providing Optimized Performance in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.925301","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4783256/04518959.pdf","startPage":"865","endPage":"881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.925301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783256","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518959/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Vertical Handoff Decision Algorithms for Providing Optimized Performance in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4518959/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475161","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vertical Handoff Decision Algorithms for Providing Optimized Performance in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"58tvt02-slee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120989S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4783256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"4783256","articleId":"4518959","onlineDate":"14 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4518960,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald Y.

Most of the existing FDE algorithms are limited to slow time-varying fading channels due to the lack of an accurate channel estimator. In this paper, we employ an interpolation method to propose new algorithms for frequency-domain channel estimation for both slow and fast time-varying fading. We show that least squares (LS)-based channel estimation and minimum mean square (MMSE)-based channel estimation with interpolations are equivalent under certain conditions. Noise variance estimation and channel equalization in the frequency domain are also discussed with fine-tuned formulas. Numerical examples indicate that the new algorithms perform very well for severe fading channels with long delay spread and high Doppler spread. It is also shown that our new algorithms outperform the recently developed frequency-domain least mean squares (LMS) and recursive LS (RLS) algorithms which are capable of dealing with moderate fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.925298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4783256/04518962.pdf","startPage":"815","endPage":"823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.925298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation for Frequency-Domain Equalization of Single-Carrier Broadband Wireless Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4518962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518962/","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation for Frequency-Domain Equalization of Single-Carrier Broadband Wireless Communications","volume":"58","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475159","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4518962/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation for Frequency-Domain Equalization of Single-Carrier Broadband Wireless Communications","sourcePdf":"58tvt02-zheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06753S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4783256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4783256","articleId":"4518962","onlineDate":"14 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4518968,"authors":[{"name":"Gye-Tae Gil","affiliation":["Future Technology Laboratory, Korea Telecom, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4783256/4518968/4518968-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gye-Tae Gil (M'04) was born in Daejeon, Korea, on July 24, 1966.

The use of two-degrees-of-freedom control architecture known as the model regulator is investigated here as a robust steering controller for such yaw stabilization tasks in a driver-assist system. The yaw stability-enhancing steering controller is designed in the parameter space to satisfy a frequency-domain mixed sensitivity constraint. To evaluate the resulting controller design, a real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulator is developed. Steering tests with and without the controller in this hardware-in-the-loop setup allow the driver to see the effect of the proposed controller to improve vehicle-handling quality. The hardware-in-the-loop simulation setup can also be used for real-time driver-in-the-loop simulation of other vehicle control systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.925312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4783256/04518969.pdf","startPage":"555","endPage":"571","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.925312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Yaw Stability Controller Design and Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing for a Road Vehicle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust Yaw Stability Controller Design and Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing for a Road Vehicle","volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4518969/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10479001","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4518969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Yaw Stability Controller Design and Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing for a Road Vehicle","sourcePdf":"58tvt02-guvenc.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130861S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4783256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4783256","articleId":"4518969","onlineDate":"14 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":4519081,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Due to the incurred losses from intersymbol interference (ISI) and intercarrier interference (ICI) introduced by synchronization errors, the SINR of the received data drastically drops. By taking advantage of this characteristic, both the symbol time and carrier frequency offsets are intuitively estimated by maximizing the SINR metric. For the SINR metric, two blind SINR estimations are investigated. The estimations do not need prior knowledge of the channel profiles and transmitted data. As such, the proposed maximum SINR (MSINR) synchronization algorithm is nondata aided so that the transmission efficiency can be improved. Moreover, to reduce the computational complexity, the early-late gate technique is proposed for the implementation of the synchronizer. Simulation results exhibit better performance for the MSINR algorithm than conventional techniques in multipath fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.925320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4783256/04519208.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.925320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783256","startPage":"625","endPage":"635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Blind Synchronizer for OFDM Systems Based on SINR Maximization in Multipath Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Blind Synchronizer for OFDM Systems Based on SINR Maximization in Multipath Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519208/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475163","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4519208/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Blind Synchronizer for OFDM Systems Based on SINR Maximization in Multipath Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"58tvt02-chin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064853S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4783256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4783256","articleId":"4519208","onlineDate":"14 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4519231,"authors":[{"name":"Peter M.

However, it has been shown that it is inevitable to use public-key cryptographic algorithms to satisfy these requirements [1]. Moreover, general public-key cryptography based authentication protocols are vulnerable in terms of anonymity, which is shown in this paper. Accordingly, we design a new authentication protocol named EC-RAC using EC (Elliptic Curve) cryptography. EC-RAC can be proved for its security in the generic group model and is carefully designed to minimize its computational workload. Moreover, we present the implementation results of EC-RAC to show its feasibility for RFID systems.","doi":"10.1109/RFID.2008.4519370","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on RFID","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on RFID","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509977/4519333/04519370.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFID.2008.4519370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4519333","startPage":"97","endPage":"104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EC-RAC (ECDLP Based Randomized Access Control): Provably Secure RFID authentication protocol","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519370","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"EC-RAC (ECDLP Based Randomized Access Control): Provably Secure RFID authentication protocol","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519370/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-17 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10039579","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4519370/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EC-RAC (ECDLP Based Randomized Access Control): Provably Secure RFID authentication protocol","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"RFID08-00-37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082487S","chronDate":"16-17 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509977","isNumber":"4519333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509977","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4519333","articleId":"4519370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4519373,"authors":[{"name":"Carlo Mutti","affiliation":["ASSA ABLOY ITG, Granges, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Carlo","lastName":"Mutti","id":"37947179300"},{"name":"Christian Floerkemeier","affiliation":["Auto-ID Laboratories, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Floerkemeier","id":"37300185100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1711-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1712-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0221"}],"articleNumber":"4519373","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":13,"totalDownloads":471},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","Multiaccess communication","Media Access Protocol","Decoding","Spread spectrum communication","Time division multiple access","Access protocols","Frequency division multiaccess","USA Councils","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","code division multiplexing","decoding","radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","tag populations","code division multiplexing","tag replies decoding","spread spectrum radiofrequency identification system"]}],"abstract":"Radiofrequency identification (RFID) applications with large tag populations often require the fast identification of the tags present. Conventional RFID systems using framed ALOHA based medium access control algorithms waste bandwidth during the singulation process when tag replies collide on the shared wireless channel. In this paper, we investigate how code division multiplexing techniques can be used to decode tag replies in such collisions. Our analysis focusses on the choice of code set and detector for use in a spread spectrum RFID system. The paper also presents a method to estimate the number of tags in the range of such a spread spectrum RFID system.","doi":"10.1109/RFID.2008.4519373","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on RFID","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on RFID","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509977/4519333/04519373.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFID.2008.4519373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4519333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CDMA-based RFID Systems in Dense Scenarios: Concepts and Challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519373/","displayDocTitle":"CDMA-based RFID Systems in Dense Scenarios: Concepts and Challenges","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10039582","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4519373/","conferenceDate":"16-17 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CDMA-based RFID Systems in Dense Scenarios: Concepts and Challenges","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"RFID08-00-40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078324S","chronDate":"16-17 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509977","isNumber":"4519333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509977","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4519333","articleId":"4519373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4519377,"authors":[{"name":"Srinivas Devadas","affiliation":["MIT, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Srinivas","lastName":"Devadas","id":"37283553100"},{"name":"Edward Suh","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Suh","id":"38548277200"},{"name":"Sid Paral","affiliation":["PUFCO, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sid","lastName":"Paral","id":"38095119000"},{"name":"Richard Sowell","affiliation":["PUFCO, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Sowell","id":"38086681600"},{"name":"Tom Ziola","affiliation":["PUFCO, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Ziola","id":"38095124200"},{"name":"Vivek Khandelwal","affiliation":["PUFCO, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vivek","lastName":"Khandelwal","id":"38078823100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1711-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1712-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0221"}],"articleNumber":"4519377","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":172,"citationCountPatent":22,"totalDownloads":2374},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519377","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","Security","RFID tags","Authentication","Silicon","Manufacturing processes","Costs","Cloning","Public key cryptography","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit manufacture","radiofrequency identification","security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RFID","physical unclonable functions","IC manufacturing","security","anticounterfeiting"]}],"abstract":"Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) exploit the physical characteristics of the silicon and the IC manufacturing process variations to uniquely characterize each and every silicon chip. Since it is practically impossible to model, copy, or control the IC manufacturing process variations, PUFs not only make these chips unique, but also effectively unclonable. Exploiting the inherent variations in the IC manufacturing process, PUFs provide a secure, robust, low cost mechanism to authenticate silicon chips. This makes PUFs attractive for RFID ICs where cost and security are the key requirements. In this paper we present the design and implementation of PUF enabled \"unclonable\" RFIDs. The PUF-enabled RFID has been fabricated in 0.18 \u03bc technology, and extensive testing results demonstrate that PUFs can securely authenticate an RFID with minimal overheads. We also highlight the advantages of PUF based RFIDs in anti-counterfeiting and security applications.","doi":"10.1109/RFID.2008.4519377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFID.2008.4519377","startPage":"58","endPage":"64","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on RFID","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on RFID","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509977/4519333/04519377.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4519333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of PUF-Based \"Unclonable\" RFID ICs for Anti-Counterfeiting and Security Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519377/","conferenceDate":"16-17 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of PUF-Based \"Unclonable\" RFID ICs for Anti-Counterfeiting and Security Applications","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10039586","publicationDate":"April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4519377/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of PUF-Based \"Unclonable\" RFID ICs for Anti-Counterfeiting and Security Applications","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"RFID08-00-44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073944S","chronDate":"16-17 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509977","isNumber":"4519333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509977","citationCount":"172","xplore-issue":"4519333","articleId":"4519377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4519381,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel J.

A PDL senses and logs data using energy stored in a capacitor; the capacitor can be wirelessly recharged (unlike active tags), and data can be uploaded whenever the PDL is near a reader. Standard EPC generation 2 readers are used for WISP-PDL charging, ID-reading, and sensor data transfer. This allows WISP-PDLs to operate using commercial RFID readers as the only support infrastructure (for both data and power), and allows WISP-PDLs to co-exist with standard RFID tags. We describe the design and implementation of a prototype WISP-PDL, and report results from a short demonstration study that shows it can monitor the temperature and fullness of a milk carton as it is used over the course of a day.","doi":"10.1109/RFID.2008.4519381","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on RFID","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on RFID","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509977/4519333/04519381.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFID.2008.4519381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4519333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wirelessly-Charged UHF Tags for Sensor Data Collection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wirelessly-Charged UHF Tags for Sensor Data Collection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10039590","publicationDate":"April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4519381/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519381/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 April 2008","conferenceDate":"16-17 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wirelessly-Charged UHF Tags for Sensor Data Collection","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"RFID08-00-48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064879S","chronDate":"16-17 April 2008","isNumber":"4519333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509977","citationCount":"77","articleId":"4519381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4519383,"authors":[{"name":"Stevan Preradovic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Stevan","lastName":"Preradovic","id":"37298748900"},{"name":"Isaac Balbin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Isaac","lastName":"Balbin","id":"37640298400"},{"name":"Nemai C.

The chosen system includes one large reciprocating engine and an absorption chiller providing an estimated 11% cost savings and 8% carbon emission reductions under idealized circumstances.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.922654","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4578730/04519391.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2008.922654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578730","startPage":"975","endPage":"982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Technology Selection and Operation of Commercial-Building Microgrids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Technology Selection and Operation of Commercial-Building Microgrids","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519391/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10117949","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4519391/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Technology Selection and Operation of Commercial-Building Microgrids","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs03-marnay.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049679S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4578730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"255","xplore-issue":"4578730","articleId":"4519391","onlineDate":"14 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4519394,"authors":[{"name":"Sai-Weng Sin","affiliation":["Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI Laboratory, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Sai-Weng","lastName":"Sin","id":"37269869400"},{"name":"U.-Fat Chio","affiliation":["Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI Laboratory, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"firstName":"U.-Fat","lastName":"Chio","id":"37270866900"},{"name":"U.

The novelty in both viewpoints is that we allow an arbitrary correlation structure for the Gaussian observation noise. First, we look at the capacity of the spatially correlated Rayleigh fading channel. We investigate the impact of channel and noise correlation on the mutual information for the on-off and Gaussian signaling schemes. Our findings establish that, in the low SNR regime, mutual information is maximized when the transmit antennas are fully correlated (the same holds for the receive array). Then, the deterministic channel setup is considered and a pairwise error probability (PEP) analysis for the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) receiver is performed. This leads to a codebook design criterion on which we base the construction of new space-time constellations. Their performance is assessed by computer simulations and, as a byproduct, we show that our codebooks are also of interest for Bayesian receivers, which decode constellations with nonuniform priors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Further Results on the Capacity and Error Probability Analysis of Noncoherent MIMO Systems in the Low SNR Regime","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.917363","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4545245/04519395.pdf","startPage":"2915","endPage":"2930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.917363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4545245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","displayDocTitle":"Further Results on the Capacity and Error Probability Analysis of Noncoherent MIMO Systems in the Low SNR Regime","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4519395/","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10058974","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Further Results on the Capacity and Error Probability Analysis of Noncoherent MIMO Systems in the Low SNR Regime","sourcePdf":"56tsp07-beko-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111471S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4545245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4545245","articleId":"4519395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4519396,"authors":[{"name":"Lun Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4545245/4519396/4519396-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lun Dong (S'06) was born in Baotou, China.

However, the process of making available the same message to all collaborating nodes introduces delays. In this paper, a medium access control-physical (MAC-PHY) cross-layer scheme is proposed that enables collaborative beamforming at significantly reduced collaboration overhead. It consists of two phases. In the first phase, nodes transmit locally in a random access time-slotted fashion. Simultaneous transmissions from multiple source nodes are viewed as linear mixtures of all transmitted packets. In the second phase, a set of collaborating nodes, acting as a distributed antenna system, beamform the received analog waveform to one or more faraway destinations. This step requires multiplication of the received analog waveform by a complex weight, which is independently computed by each collaborating node, and which allows packets bound to the same destination to add coherently at the destination node. Assuming that each node has access to location information, the proposed scheme can achieve high throughput, which in certain cases exceeds one. Analyses of the average beampattern, networking performance, and symbol error probability corresponding to the proposed scheme are provided.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cross-Layer Approach to Collaborative Beamforming for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.917352","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4545245/04519396.pdf","startPage":"2981","endPage":"2993","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.917352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4545245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519396/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Cross-Layer Approach to Collaborative Beamforming for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4519396/","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10064532","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cross-Layer Approach to Collaborative Beamforming for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"56tsp07-dong-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096033S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4545245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4545245","articleId":"4519396","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4519397,"authors":[{"name":"Marvi Teixeira","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science, University of Puerto Rico, Hato Rey, Puerto Rico","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science, Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico, Hato Rey, PR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4545245/4519397/4519397-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marvi Teixeira (S'86\u2013M'90) received the B.S.E.E. degree from Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico, Hato Rey, in 1989, and the M.S.E.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez, in 1994 and 1999, respectively.","Currently, he is a Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science and a Graduate Program Coordinator at Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico.

In addition to the architectural advantages, the proposed formulations offer a comparable number of parallel subsections, and a reduction in the number of pre/postprocessing vector operations, for the same range of decimation rates proposed by the most efficient alternative algorithm. The proposed algorithms do not impose any of the traditional constraints, such as the demand that the convolution length be factorable into mutually prime factors. The use of recursion results in the definition of two new mathematical constructs, which are intrinsic to these novel architectures, the higher order block pseudocirculant or superblock pseudocirculant matrix and the block pseudocyclic shift operator that leads to unfolded data-flow graphs of cyclic shifts.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.917375","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"2755","endPage":"2770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.917375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4545245","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4545245/04519397.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Very large scale integration","Clustering algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Circuits","Computer architecture","Computer science","Discrete Fourier transforms","Discrete cosine transforms","Concurrent computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","data flow graphs","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block pseudocirculant matrix","recursive formulation","parallel cyclic convolution algorithm","very large scale integration circuit","multi field programmable gate array system","multiprocessor architecture","unfolded data-flow graph"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block pseudocirculants","cyclic shift","fast convolution","higher order block pseudocirculants","parallel cyclic convolution","superblock pseudocirculant matrices","unfolded cyclic shift operators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Cyclic Convolution Based on Recursive Formulations of Block Pseudocirculant Matrices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519397/","volume":"56","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4519397/","accessionNumber":"10064542","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Cyclic Convolution Based on Recursive Formulations of Block Pseudocirculant Matrices","sourcePdf":"56tsp07-teixeira-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0843S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4545245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4545245","articleId":"4519397","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":4519398,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Wan","affiliation":["Center for Signal Processing and Communications, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4545245/4519398/4519398-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feng Wan received the B.E. degree from Wuhan University, China, in 2000 and the M.E. degree from Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, in 2003, both in electrical engineering.

The blind constraint is derived from the linear prediction of the received MIMO-OFDM signal and is used in conjunction with a weighting factor in the semiblind cost function. An appealing scheme for the determination of the weighting factor is presented as a part of the proposed approach. A perturbation analysis of the proposed method is conducted to justify the superiority of the semiblind solution and to obtain a closed-form expression for the mean square error (MSE) of the blind constraint, further facilitating the calculation of the weighting factor. The proposed method is validated through computer simulation-based experimentations, showing a very high estimation accuracy of the semiblind solution in terms of the MSE of the channel estimate.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4545245/04519398.pdf","startPage":"2821","endPage":"2834","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.917354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.917354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4545245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Semiblind Channel Estimation Approach for MIMO\u2013OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Receiving antennas","OFDM","Signal processing algorithms","Statistics","Mean square error methods","Frequency estimation","Vectors","Least squares approximation","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiblind channel estimation approach","training-based least square criterion","multiple-input-multiple-output-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","perturbation analysis","mean square error","computer simulation-based experimentations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) linear prediction","MIMO\u2013orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO\u2013OFDM)","perturbation analysis","semiblind"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Semiblind Channel Estimation Approach for MIMO\u2013OFDM Systems","volume":"56","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4519398/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10058992","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Semiblind Channel Estimation Approach for MIMO\u2013OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"56tsp07-wan-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080353S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4545245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4545245","articleId":"4519398","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4519501,"authors":[{"name":"Nuno B.

In the field of wireless telecommunications, multisines are often used to provide realistic test signals that have statistics similar to various types of digitally modulated signals. It is concluded that the multisine approach is well suited for evaluating a nonlinear system excited by real communication signals. Multisine signals enable to gather important information about the in-band distortion and to excite long-term memory effects by generating baseband components. They are periodic and straightforward to characterize, making them ideal for identifying both magnitude and phase distortion during test and verification. Using multisines to simulate standard wireless system excitations and figures of merit allows for very good laboratory nonlinear distortion measurement setups.","doi":"10.1109/MMM.2008.919938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/6668/4519456/04519501.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2008.919938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4519456","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multisine signals for wireless system test and design [Application Notes]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multisine signals for wireless system test and design [Application Notes]","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519501/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4519501/","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10002916","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multisine signals for wireless system test and design [Application Notes]","sourcePdf":"09mmm03-appnotes.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086426S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"4519456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4519456","articleId":"4519501","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4519508,"authors":[{"name":"Kumar Narendra","affiliation":["Research and Development Department, Motorola Technology, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Kumar","lastName":"Narendra","id":"37544845500"},{"name":"Lokesh Anand","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, University of Science Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Lokesh","lastName":"Anand","id":"37545686600"},{"name":"Pragash Sangaran","affiliation":["Research and Development Department, Motorola Technology, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Pragash","lastName":"Sangaran","id":"38093604200"},{"name":"M.F.

Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology. There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively different from those in general- purpose computing. Moreover, physical components are qualitatively different from object-oriented software components. Standard abstractions based on method calls and threads do not work. This paper examines the challenges in designing such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today's computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are built on today's abstractions. To realize the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace physical dynamics and computation in a unified way.","doi":"10.1109/ISORC.2008.25","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE International Symposium on Object and Component-Oriented Real-Time Distributed Computing (ISORC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE International Symposium on Object and Component-Oriented Real-Time Distributed Computing (ISORC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4519543/4519544/04519604.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4519544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISORC.2008.25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyber Physical Systems: Design Challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519604","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cyber Physical Systems: Design Challenges","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519604/","publicationDate":"May 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9977702","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4519604/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyber Physical Systems: Design Challenges","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3132a363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05576S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4519543","isNumber":"4519544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4519543","citationCount":"1686","xplore-issue":"4519544","articleId":"4519604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4519607,"authors":[{"name":"Mehmet H.

However, mathematical system modeling necessary for feedback control is challenging. To reduce the difficulty of system modeling, we apply fuzzy control for direct nonlinear mappings between the utilization error (= target utilization - current utilization) and the workload adjustment required to achieve the target utilization via IF-THEN rules. Moreover, via online adaptation, our fuzzy controller can amplify or dampen its own fuzzy control signal, if necessary, to expedite the convergence to the desired utilization. In our simulation study, our approach quickly converges to the target utilization when the workload significantly changes. In contrast, the tested baselines oscillate between overload and underutilization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4519607/","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9977705","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Fuzzy Control for Utilization Management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Fuzzy Control for Utilization Management","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3132a383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075708S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4519543","isNumber":"4519544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4519543","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4519544","articleId":"4519607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4519689,"authors":[{"name":"Pouya Aflaki","affiliation":["IRadio Laboratory, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Pouya","lastName":"Aflaki","id":"38525013200"},{"name":"Renato Negra","affiliation":["IRadio Laboratory, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Negra","id":"37275858200"},{"name":"Fadhel M.

The most common procedure used until now is based on observations and on the intuition of the programmer for choosing the number of iterations for which the algorithm runs. This can cause a deficit either in the precision of the solution or in the runtime of the algorithm if the choice is not proper. We propose an alternative method that estimates after what number of generations there appear no more significant differences in the variance of the algorithm's results. This method is tested on optimization problems of various types: continuous/discontinuous, convex/non-convex, deterministic/stochastic. ANOVA (analysis of variance) method is used to compare the means of two or more independent random variables with normal distributions. The GA is run several times, for various numbers of generations. By gradually applying the statistical test of the ANOVA method, it is determined the moment from which no significant differences appear in the results. This method provides an optimum balance between the precision of the solution and the run time of the algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 15 2007-Sept. 17 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519769/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9982591","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4519769/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2008","conferenceDate":"15 Oct.-17 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Procedure based on the ANOVA Method for Estimating the Maximum Number of Generations for Optimization Genetic Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Procedure based on the ANOVA Method for Estimating the Maximum Number of Generations for Optimization Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Sinaia, Romania","sourcePdf":"SMICND-2-61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038831S","chronDate":"Oct. 15 2007-Sept. 17 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4498400","isNumber":"4519708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4498400","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4519708","articleId":"4519769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4519809,"authors":[{"name":"Siu-Wai Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Siu-Wai","lastName":"Wu","id":"37351454300"},{"name":"Allen Gersho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Allen","lastName":"Gersho","id":"37281163500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"4519809","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":135},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital recording","HDTV","Image coding","Partitioning algorithms","Video compression","Bit rate","Video recording","Lagrangian functions","Discrete cosine transforms","Vector quantization"]}],"abstract":"An image coding algorithm for digital video tape recorders (DVTR) must satisfy several requirements which do not arise in other applications of video compression. A key constraint on the data format is satisfied if every frame (or field) of video is partitioned into a small number of subimages, each independently coded with a fixed number of bits. This requirement excludes the use of interframe coding and most variable-rate image coding algorithms. We propose to use a new algorithm that codes a subimage efficiently under this data format constraint and allows virtually lossless reproduction at reasonable low bit rates. Each subimage is partitioned into non-overlapping blocks and each block is coded by one of a finite set of predesigned block quantizers covering a range of bit rates. For the ith block in the subimage, a rate function R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n(L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n) and a distortion function D\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n(L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n) is tabulated for each block quantizer L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n. A near-optimal quantizer allocation algorithm based on the Lagrange Multiplier method is used to select a particular quantizer for each block. The objective is to minimize the distortion of the entire subimage under the constraint on the total number of bits for the subimage. A system for the compression of HDTV for DVTR's based on this rate-constrained optimal block-adaptive technique is designed using the DCT and vector quantization with a multistage structure. Simulation results demonstrate that this algorithm has the potential of achieving virtually lossless compression for digital tape recording of HDTV.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-constrained optimal block-adaptive coding for digital tape recording of HDTV","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.1991.4519809","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/3317/04519809.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.1991.4519809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519809/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1991","displayDocTitle":"Rate-constrained optimal block-adaptive coding for digital tape recording of HDTV","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-constrained optimal block-adaptive coding for digital tape recording of HDTV","sourcePdf":"x0344228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043042S","chronDate":"March  1991","isNumber":"3317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"50","articleId":"4519809","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4519811,"authors":[{"name":"Laeticia Petit","affiliation":["School of Material Science and Engineering, Center for Optical Materials Science and Engineering Technologies (COMSET), Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/4636769/4519811/4519811-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Laeticia Petit received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in physical chemistry from the University of Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France, in 1996 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in materials science from the University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France, in 2002.","She is currently a Research Assistant Professor in the School of Materials Science and Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC.

These findings, reported by groups at the University of Central Florida, Clemson University, and throughout other research programs within the United States and abroad, have examined the relationship between the network modification and other photoresponse of IR glasses upon exposure to near-infrared (NIR) femtosecond laser exposure. Contained is a review on the principles of femtosecond laser writing in glass, the photoinduced phenomena, and a summary of the main models predicting photoinduced material response. We compare the photoresponse of As- and Ge-based films, taken as example, following NIR femtosecond laser irradiation that results in near-surface photoexpansion and an increase or decrease of the refractive index, respectively. This difference in photoresponse has been related to the \"layered\" network of the As-based glass that leads to the breaking and formation of bonds during laser exposure as compared to the 3-D network of Ge-based glass that leads only to a modification of the bond arrangements. Last, an explanation of the need to control the photoresponse of ChGs by aging, changing the glass thermal history, adding modifiers, or replacing the anions forming the network is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2008.922898","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/4636769/04519811.pdf","startPage":"1323","endPage":"1334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2008.922898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4636769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progress on the Photoresponse of Chalcogenide Glasses and Films to Near-Infrared Femtosecond Laser Irradiation: A Review","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519811/","displayDocTitle":"Progress on the Photoresponse of Chalcogenide Glasses and Films to Near-Infrared Femtosecond Laser Irradiation: A Review","volume":"14","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222619","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4519811/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progress on the Photoresponse of Chalcogenide Glasses and Films to Near-Infrared Femtosecond Laser Irradiation: A Review","sourcePdf":"14jstqe05-petit.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.204203S","chronDate":"Sept.-oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"4636769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4636769","articleId":"4519811","onlineDate":"14 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4519837,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, PTS has a relatively high computational complexity due to the computation of multiple inverse fast Fourier transforms (IFFTs). To reduce this complexity, fractional subblocking was introduced where a subset of inputs to identical inverse discrete Fourier transforms (IDFTs) (within an N-point IFFT) were used for subblocking. Unfortunately, the PAPR performance is degraded as the number of identical DFTs is increased. In this paper, we exploit the periodic autocorrelation function (ACF) of the PTS sequences to improve the PAPR performance with fractional subblocks. We show that a PAPR reduction is achieved which is better than with pseudo-random subblocking.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Autocorrelation Fractional PTS Subblocking for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)","doi":"10.1109/CNSR.2008.24","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4519815/4519816/04519837.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2008.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4519816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Low Autocorrelation Fractional PTS Subblocking for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4519837/","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9977415","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Autocorrelation Fractional PTS Subblocking for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Halifax, NS, Canada","sourcePdf":"3135a041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073403S","chronDate":"5-8 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4519815","isNumber":"4519816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4519815","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4519816","articleId":"4519837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4519839,"authors":[{"name":"Mikael Gidlund","affiliation":["Nera Networks, Norway"],"firstName":"Mikael","lastName":"Gidlund","id":"37298285200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3135-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4519839","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitters","Array signal processing","Diversity reception","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","OFDM modulation","Feedback","Narrowband","Matrix decomposition","Singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","broadband networks","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sub-optimal eigenvalue-based adaptive modulation","broadband MIMO-OFDM systems","multiple input multiple output systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","3GPP LTE","long term evolution","preceding matrix","singular value decomposition","low complexity ratio-based algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM","Adaptive Modulation","SNR"]}],"abstract":"The ability to provide high data rate is a key measure in 3GPP long term evolution (LTE).

A wireless local area network (WLAN) system was simulated for frequency selective fading channel model with and without Inter symbol interference (ISI) encounter. Moreover CP and ZP variants of both OFDM and SC-DFE are simulated to compare the coding gains. More coding gain is comparatively achieved by the SC-DFE when ISI is encountered and by the OFDM when ISI is not encountered.","doi":"10.1109/CNSR.2008.40","publicationTitle":"6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4519815/4519816/04519840.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2008.40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4519816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of Coding on OFDM and Single Carrier Transmission with Decision Feedback Equalizer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519840/","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Coding on OFDM and Single Carrier Transmission with Decision Feedback Equalizer","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9977418","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4519840/","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Coding on OFDM and Single Carrier Transmission with Decision Feedback Equalizer","confLoc":"Halifax, NS, Canada","sourcePdf":"3135a059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083781S","chronDate":"5-8 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4519815","isNumber":"4519816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4519815","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4519816","articleId":"4519840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4519842,"authors":[{"name":"Mahbod Tavallaee","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of New Brunswick, Canada"],"firstName":"Mahbod","lastName":"Tavallaee","id":"37393414600"},{"name":"Wei Lu","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of New Brunswick, Canada"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Lu","id":"37404585200"},{"name":"Shah Arif Iqbal","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of New Brunswick, Canada"],"firstName":"Shah Arif","lastName":"Iqbal","id":"38092912800"},{"name":"Ali A.

In this paper, we present a novel network anomaly detection approach based on wavelet analysis, approximate autoregressive and outlier detection techniques. In order to characterize network traffic behaviors, we proposed fifteen features and applied them as the input signals in our wavelet-based approach. We then evaluate our approach with the 1999 DARPA intrusion detection dataset and conduct a comprehensive comparison for four different typical wavelet basis functions on detecting network intrusions. Our work aims to unveil a question when applying wavelet techniques for detecting network attacks, that is \"do wavelet basis functions have an important impact on the intrusion detection performance?\". Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the work is the first to analyze the 1999 DARPA's network traffic using flow data instead of its original raw packet data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Network Anomalies Using Different Wavelet Basis Functions","publicationTitle":"6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)","doi":"10.1109/CNSR.2008.75","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4519815/4519816/04519851.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2008.75","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4519816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Network Anomalies Using Different Wavelet Basis Functions","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4519851/","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9977429","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Network Anomalies Using Different Wavelet Basis Functions","confLoc":"Halifax, NS, Canada","sourcePdf":"3135a149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072286S","chronDate":"5-8 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4519815","isNumber":"4519816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4519815","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4519816","articleId":"4519851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4519856,"authors":[{"name":"Brian William Walker","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Brian William","lastName":"Walker","id":"38257524600"},{"name":"Jacek Ilow","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Jacek","lastName":"Ilow","id":"37280038500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3135-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4519856","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":142},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519856","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital audio broadcasting","Bandwidth","Amplitude modulation","Radio broadcasting","Phase modulation","Signal processing","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Frequency division multiplexing","OFDM modulation","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","amplitude modulation","digital audio broadcasting","OFDM modulation","phase modulation","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral regrowth reduction","digital audio broadcasting","EER amplifiers","amplitude modulation radio broadcast band","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","OFDM modulation","low bandwidth amplitude modulated signal","phase modulation","AM transmitters","envelope elimination and restoration amplifier","time-domain pre-processing","computational complexity","error vector magnitude","spectral regrowth reductions","frequency 10 kHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital Audio Broadcasting","OFDM","EER Amplifiers","Spectral Regrowth Reduction"]}],"abstract":"For the amplitude modulation (AM) radio broadcast band, there are several standards being considered for digital audio broadcast (DAB), all using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). One of the main challenges to implementing digital audio broadcasting is that existing broadcast equipment was not designed for it. Unlike analog AM, which is a low bandwidth amplitude modulated signal, OFDM is a noise-like signal with significant amplitude and phase modulation. Most AM transmitters use an envelope elimination and restoration (EER) amplifier architecture, where the amplitude and phase components of the signal are amplified separately then recombined at the high power stage. The magnitude and phase component bandwidths are several times that of the input signal, and any filtering in the amplifier will result in spectral regrowth due to poor cancellation of this high frequency content. This paper develops the concept of using time-domain preprocessing on the signal to reduce the bandwidth expansion in EER amplifiers. The processing exploits the localization of the bandwidth expansion and its correlation with spectral regrowth at the output. The proposed algorithm identifies distortion- causing signal sections and replaces each one with an alternative signal trajectory. Using the processing, out of band emissions are reduced at the expense of increased computational complexity and error vector magnitude. Promising results are shown for the DRM 10 kHz digital signal, with reductions in spectral regrowth of up to 10 dB.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4519816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2008.90","publicationTitle":"6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4519815/4519816/04519856.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"190","doi":"10.1109/CNSR.2008.90","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral Regrowth Reduction for Digital Audio Broadcasting Using EER Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Spectral Regrowth Reduction for Digital Audio Broadcasting Using EER Amplifiers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4519856/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9977434","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519856/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Regrowth Reduction for Digital Audio Broadcasting Using EER Amplifiers","confLoc":"Halifax, NS, Canada","sourcePdf":"3135a185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036338S","chronDate":"5-8 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4519815","isNumber":"4519816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4519815","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4519816","articleId":"4519856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4519859,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Telecommunications, Swansea University, UK"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Wu","id":"38090979600"},{"name":"Xinheng Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Telecommunications, Swansea University, UK"],"firstName":"Xinheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37540102100"},{"name":"Rui Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Telecommunications, Swansea University, UK"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37289648800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3135-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4519859","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Ad hoc networks","Genetic algorithms","Polynomials","Heuristic algorithms","Transmitters","Communication networks","Constraint optimization","Tree graphs","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","computational complexity","genetic algorithms","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum power broadcast problem","wireless ad-hoc network","permutation encoded genetic algorithm","nondeterministic polynomial complete","diverse heuristic algorithm","constrained optimisation problem","graph representation","deterministic greedy algorithm","MPB tree","greedy-based broadcast incremental power"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithm","Broadcast","Ad Hoc"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519859","abstract":"A novel permutation encoded genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed for solving the minimum power broadcast (MPB) problem in wireless ad-hoc networks.

The powerful search capability of GA is a key factor in improving the system performance in terms of the total consumption power.

In these so called multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication systems, the performance of symbol detection methods is tightly related to the channel knowledge at the receiver side. Practically, the channel information at the receiver is subjected to error because of the outdated data, quantization error, and imperfect channel estimation/measurement. It is known that in the case of imperfect channel knowledge, performance of symbol detection in MIMO communication systems may severely degrades. In this paper, we briefly address the effect of channel estimation error on the performance of sphere detector in MIMO communication systems. We analytically propose and study two detection methods to improve the performance of sphere detector when the channel matrix is imperfectly known at receiver. In our proposed robust method, the sphere detection algorithm is modified while a small computational complexity is added to the detector.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sphere Detection in MIMO Communication Systems with Imperfect Channel State Information","publicationTitle":"6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)","doi":"10.1109/CNSR.2008.50","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4519815/4519816/04519863.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2008.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4519816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Sphere Detection in MIMO Communication Systems with Imperfect Channel State Information","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4519863/","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9977441","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sphere Detection in MIMO Communication Systems with Imperfect Channel State Information","confLoc":"Halifax, NS, Canada","sourcePdf":"3135a228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069845S","chronDate":"5-8 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4519815","isNumber":"4519816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4519815","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4519816","articleId":"4519863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4519866,"authors":[{"name":"Junfeng Hu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Network, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Junfeng","lastName":"Hu","id":"37878313300"},{"name":"Hailin Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Network, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hailin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293132300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3135-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4519866","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space time codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Data communication","MIMO","Block codes","Decision feedback equalizers","Communication networks","Laboratories","Intserv networks","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","broadband networks","data communication","equalisers","feedback","maximum likelihood decoding","mean square error methods","modulation","space-time codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoder","space-time block code","vertical Bell Laboratories layered space-time decoding model","minimum mean-square error decision feedback equalizer","Fano-search","STC decoding","maximum- likelihood decoding","signal-to-noise ratio","arbitrary modulation constellations","broadband data transmission","wireless channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum likelihood (ML) decoding","multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system","perfect space-time codes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519866","doi":"10.1109/CNSR.2008.13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2008.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4519816","publicationTitle":"6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4519815/4519816/04519866.pdf","startPage":"249","endPage":"254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Decoder for Perfect Space-Time Codes","abstract":"Perfect space-time block code (STBC) is one of the most excellent space-time codes (STC).

The latter factor is important as under total transmit energy constraint there is a trade-off between boosting power of the pilot symbols to gain more accurate channel estimates and maintaining higher signal-to-noise ratio at the data subcarriers to minimise probability of detection error in the assumption of sufficiently reliable channel state information.","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4519815/4519816/04519896.pdf","startPage":"470","endPage":"477","publicationTitle":"6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)","doi":"10.1109/CNSR.2008.57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2008.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4519816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4519896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Training for the SM-MIMO-OFDM Systems with MMSE Channel Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","State estimation","Channel state information","MIMO","OFDM","Broadband communication","Wireless communication","Communication standards","Closed-form solution","Boosting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel estimation","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","probability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal training","SM-MIMO-OFDM systems","spatially multiplexed multiple input multiple output","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","transmission capacity","MMSE channel estimation","broadband wireless communication standards","channel state information estimation","data detection","optimal power allocation","data symbols","data subcarriers","probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spatial multiplexing","multipath channels","minimum mean squared error","pilot-to-data power ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Training for the SM-MIMO-OFDM Systems with MMSE Channel Estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4519896/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9977474","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2008","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Training for the SM-MIMO-OFDM Systems with MMSE Channel Estimation","confLoc":"Halifax, NS, Canada","sourcePdf":"3135a470.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078356S","chronDate":"5-8 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4519815","isNumber":"4519816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4519815","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4519816","articleId":"4519896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4519898,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The basis of this technique is that the location of an object is estimated using an estimation algorithm and the radio frequency (RF) fingerprint database as a reference. The main target of this paper is to find an optimum strategy for the construction of the RF map and a decent estimation algorithm. By obtaining statistical data from several signal strength measurements, we investigate and identify three influential factors on the RSSI behavior. With this knowledge, we propose improvement to the existing deterministic algorithm. An algorithm for detection of and dealing with the aliasing problem is also suggested. Test results show that our proposed combinational deterministic method and the anti aliasing technique improves the system performance by up to 33% compared to other deterministic method using single scalar values.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Frequency estimation","Employment","Indoor environments","Fingerprint recognition","Databases","Signal processing","Radiofrequency identification","System testing","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antialiasing","deterministic algorithms","mobile communication","radio tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiofrequency RSSI","deterministic algorithm","IEEE 802.11 radio signals","object location estimation","radio frequency fingerprint database","signal strength measurements","mobile communication","antialiasing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deterministic algorithms","Estimation","Antialiasing","Wireless LAN","Mobile communication"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4519816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2008.32","startPage":"488","endPage":"495","publicationTitle":"6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4519815/4519816/04519898.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CNSR.2008.32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location Determination Using Radio Frequency RSSI and Deterministic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Location Determination Using Radio Frequency RSSI and Deterministic Algorithm","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9977476","publicationDate":"May 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4519898/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location Determination Using Radio Frequency RSSI and Deterministic Algorithm","confLoc":"Halifax, NS, Canada","sourcePdf":"3135a488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.144958S","chronDate":"5-8 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4519815","isNumber":"4519816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4519815","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4519816","articleId":"4519898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4519899,"authors":[{"name":"Jianshu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianshu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37635067200"},{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406476300"},{"name":"Pengyu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Pengyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37629992900"},{"name":"Jian Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37311486300"},{"name":"Xiuming Shan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiuming","lastName":"Shan","id":"37274690100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3135-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4519899","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Multiaccess communication","Timing","Covariance matrix","System performance","Performance analysis","Analytical models","Bit error rate","Interference suppression","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","code division multiple access","covariance matrices","error statistics","multipath channels","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal projection approach","blind beamforming technique","multipath CDMA channels","spatial covariance matrix estimation","interference matrix","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a blind beamforming technique for multipath CDMA channels, which requires prior knowledge of only the spreading code and the timing of the desired user.

The method, called decision boundary gap estimation (DBGE), monitors the output of the ADC to estimate the size of code gaps that result at the decision boundaries of each stage. Code gaps result from such effects as capacitor mismatch, finite opamp gain, finite current source output impedance, comparator offset, and charge injection. DBGE does not require special calibration signals or additional analog hardware and can even reduce the performance requirements of the analog circuitry. The calibration is performed using the input signal and thus requires that the input signal exercise the codes in the vicinity of the decision boundaries of each stage.

The performance of the SMC approach is shown for low- and high-order constellation schemes for different values of the input backoff (IBO). The results show that, in low-IBO regimes, the SMC method provides a significant improvement compared to conventional methods, such as the predistorter, especially for high-order constellations while the use of the predistorter is preferred in only a very limited number of cases. Moreover, the SMC framework is shown to have more robust behavior to the constellation scaling. The application of the SMC framework to multicarrier systems is also addressed and the behavior of the system in terms of the out-of-band emissions as a function of the output backoff (OBO) is investigated. Finally, an adaptive sequential Monte Carlo receiver is proposed that adapts itself efficiently to the variations in the amplifier parameters. This adaptive scheme does not require a training sequence and does not suffer from convergence problems.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.925376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.925376","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4684845/04519967.pdf","startPage":"3270","endPage":"3283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519967/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Compensation of the Nonlinearity of Solid-State Power Amplifiers Using Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo Methods","volume":"55","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10346658","htmlLink":"/document/4519967/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Compensation of the Nonlinearity of Solid-State Power Amplifiers Using Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo Methods","sourcePdf":"55tcsi10-shabany.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102475S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4684845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4684845","articleId":"4519967","onlineDate":"14 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4519969,"authors":[{"name":"Viktor V.

The determination of harmonic currents injected into a power network by a nonlinear load is complicated when the supply voltage waveform to the load is distorted by other loads and not a pure sinusoid. This paper proposes a neural network solution to this problem. A recurrent neural network trained with the backpropagation through time training algorithm is used to find a way of distinguishing between the so-called load harmonics and supply harmonics, without disconnecting the load from the network. The advantage of this method is that only waveforms of voltages and currents have to be measured. This method is applicable for both single and three phase loads and could be fabricated into a commercial instrument that could be installed in substations of large customer loads, or used as a hand-held clip on instrument. This paper is particularly useful in determining whether the utility or the customer side has a higher contribution to harmonic pollution in a network. Hence, this method would be helpful in settling utility-customer disputes over who is responsible for harmonic pollution.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.925315","startPage":"3484","endPage":"3491","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.925315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4609005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4609005/04519974.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent Neural Networks Trained With Backpropagation Through Time Algorithm to Estimate Nonlinear Load Harmonic Currents","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519974/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Recurrent Neural Networks Trained With Backpropagation Through Time Algorithm to Estimate Nonlinear Load Harmonic Currents","volume":"55","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4519974/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10180498","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 May 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent Neural Networks Trained With Backpropagation Through Time Algorithm to Estimate Nonlinear Load Harmonic Currents","sourcePdf":"55tie09-mazumdar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064044S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4609005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"4609005","articleId":"4519974","onlineDate":"14 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":4519976,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Kunusch","affiliation":["Universidad Nacional de La Plata, La Plata, Argentina"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Kunusch","id":"37540703900"},{"name":"Paul F.

The estimated void fractions of the conductors are 31% and 33%. Here we report the details of the TF conductor development and the performance test result of them carried out in SULTAN. Regarding the conductor development, the internal-Sn-processed strand characteristics, strand cabling, twist pitch and characteristics of the conduits for the conductors are presented. For an extended understanding of the conductor design and performance, the SULTAN test results are presented and the effect of the void fraction variations is discussed based on the results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4538104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2008.921256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/4538104/04519991.pdf","startPage":"1084","endPage":"1087","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2008.921256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development and Sultan Test Result of ITER Conductor Samples of Korea","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","displayDocTitle":"Development and Sultan Test Result of ITER Conductor Samples of Korea","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4519991/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10075221","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4519991/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development and Sultan Test Result of ITER Conductor Samples of Korea","sourcePdf":"18tasc02-kim2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162307S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"4538104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4538104","articleId":"4519991","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"}]
