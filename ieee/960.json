To achieve both performance and power efficiency, a stream processing architecture specialized for CNN hardware module is adopted to implement many low-power arithmetic units. In addition, 6 MB of local memories are implemented to reduce data transfers between dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and the CNN hardware, thereby improving the execution efficiency of the arithmetic units and saving power consumption caused by the data transfer. In order to support high safety integrity level with power efficiency, we provide safety mechanisms with high failure detection rates only for the hardware used in applications that require ASIL D support. The configuration of two CNN modules can switch between lockstep and single operation depending on the use case, thus achieving a tradeoff between performance and ASIL while maintaining power efficiency. In addition, the freedom from interference (FFI) concept defined in ISO 26262 is achieved by providing mechanisms to prevent low safety level tasks from interfering with high safety level tasks running concurrently inside the processor.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9664397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2021.3120191","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/9664397/09600004.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"126","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2021.3120191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 12-nm Autonomous Driving Processor With 60.4 TOPS, 13.8 TOPS/W CNN Executed by Task-Separated ASIL D Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"A 12-nm Autonomous Driving Processor With 60.4 TOPS, 13.8 TOPS/W CNN Executed by Task-Separated ASIL D Control","volume":"57","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9600004/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9600004/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 12-nm Autonomous Driving Processor With 60.4 TOPS, 13.8 TOPS/W CNN Executed by Task-Separated ASIL D Control","sourcePdf":"jssc-matsubara-3120191-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054328S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"9664397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","xplore-issue":"9664397","articleId":"9600004","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-28"},{"_id":9600273,"authors":[{"name":"Lavinia Ferariu","affiliation":["Technical University of Ia\u0219i, Ia\u0219i, Romania"],"firstName":"Lavinia","lastName":"Ferariu","id":"37541752300"},{"name":"Camelia Petrescu","affiliation":["Technical University of Ia\u0219i, Ia\u0219i, Romania"],"firstName":"Camelia","lastName":"Petrescu","id":"38185078800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0078-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0079-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9600273","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9600273","abstract":"In multimodal optimization, it is important to obtain all the optima in a single run, for an insightful description of the potential design configurations. Genetic algorithms, as population-based approaches, are very suitable for this purpose. In this paper, the genetic algorithm is designed to work on subpopulations, which use special mechanisms for the insertion of offspring and immigrants. Mainly, the subpopulations are designed to allow speciation, each species being potentially formed around a global optimum. To this end, the insertion mechanism uses a combination of fitness-based and similarity-based insertion techniques, which can help both for preserving the exploration in diverse areas and for improving the accuracy of the solutions. A highly nonlinear problem is considered as a case study \u2013 that of finding the propagation constants of a planar dielectric microwave guide. The experimental investigations carried out for different waveguide setups show that using migration with similitude-based insertion of migrants helps achieve accurate locations of all optima, with reasonable computational costs.","doi":"10.1109/SIELMEN53755.2021.9600273","startPage":"274","endPage":"279","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Electromechanical and Energy Systems (SIELMEN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9600059/9600262/09600273.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Electromechanical and Energy Systems (SIELMEN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIELMEN53755.2021.9600273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9600262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving Multimodal Problems Using Genetic Algorithms \u2013 A Case Study in Electromagnetics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sociology","Electromagnetic waveguides","Microwave theory and techniques","Linear programming","Dielectrics","Propagation constant","Statistics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dielectric waveguides","genetic algorithms","multimodal optimization","migration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9600273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Solving Multimodal Problems Using Genetic Algorithms \u2013 A Case Study in Electromagnetics","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9600273/","publicationDate":"6 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2021","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving Multimodal Problems Using Genetic Algorithms \u2013 A Case Study in Electromagnetics","confLoc":"Iasi, Romania","sourcePdf":"69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061754S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9600059","isNumber":"9600262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9600059","xplore-issue":"9600262","articleId":"9600273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9600458,"authors":[{"name":"Sina Sayyah Ensan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Sina","lastName":"Sayyah Ensan","orcid":"0000-0003-3877-8603"},{"name":"Karthikeyan Nagarajan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Karthikeyan","lastName":"Nagarajan","orcid":"0000-0002-0518-4940"},{"name":"Mohammad Nasim Imtiaz Khan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad Nasim Imtiaz","lastName":"Khan","orcid":"0000-0002-4531-5191"},{"name":"Swaroop Ghosh","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Swaroop","lastName":"Ghosh","orcid":"0000-0001-8753-490X"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"9600458","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"abstract":"In-memory computing (IMC) architectures provide a much needed solution to energy-efficiency barriers posed by Von-Neumann computing. The functions implemented in such in-memory architectures are often proprietary and constitute confidential intellectual property (IP). Our studies indicate that IMC architectures implemented using resistive RAM (RRAM) are susceptible to side channel attack (SCA). Unlike the conventional SCAs that are aimed to leak private keys from cryptographic implementations, SCA on IMC for reverse engineering (SCARE) can reveal the sensitive IP implemented within the memory through power/timing side channels. Therefore, the adversary does not need to perform invasive reverse engineering (RE) to unlock the functionality. We demonstrate SCARE by taking recent IMC architectures, such as dynamic computing in memory (DCIM) and memristor-aided logic (MAGIC) as test cases. Simulation results indicate that AND, OR, and NOR gates (which are the building blocks of complex functions) yield distinct power and timing signatures based on the number of inputs, making them vulnerable to SCA. We show that adversary can use templates (using foundry-calibrated simulations or fabricating known functions in test chips) and analysis to identify the structure of the implemented function by testing a limited number of patterns. We also propose countermeasures, such as redundant inputs and expansion of literals. Redundant inputs can mask the IP with 25% area and 20% power overhead. However, functions can be found at higher RE effort. Expansion of literals incurs 36% power overhead. However, it imposes a brute force search increasing the adversarial RE effort by \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$3.04\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SCARE: Side Channel Attack on In-Memory Computing for Reverse Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3110744","endPage":"2051","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9627316/09600458.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","startPage":"2040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3110744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9627316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9600458","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Random access memory","Computer architecture","Timing","Voltage","Side-channel attacks","IP networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["In-memory computing (IMC)","side channel attack (SCA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SCARE: Side Channel Attack on In-Memory Computing for Reverse Engineering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9600458/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"29","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9600458/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC)","grantNumber":"2847.001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-1722557, CCF-1718474, CNS-1814710, DGE-1723687 and DGE-1821766"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SCARE: Side Channel Attack on In-Memory Computing for Reverse Engineering","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-sayyahensan-3110744-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100973S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9627316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9627316","articleId":"9600458","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":9600459,"authors":[{"name":"Jaehun Lee","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea","System LSI Business, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/9670864/9600459/lee-3122533-small.gif","p":["Jaehun Lee (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea, in 2011 and 2013, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","Since 2013, he has been with Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea, where he is currently a Staff Engineer and involved in cellular RF integrated circuit development.

The PAs cover multiple 5G communication bands, n257 (26.5\u201329.5 GHz) and n260 (37\u201340 GHz), which use reconfigurable transmission line transformers (TLTs) for output, input, and interstage matching networks. These matching networks allow the operating frequency bands to be changed, thereby achieving optimum performance.

Second, choosing the convenient detection model system which matches the desired requirements from having high accuracy with satisfying frames per second (FPS). To overcome the first challenge, a new dataset was created by extracting 1800 frames from videos and manually annotating them to overcome the different background issues and the complex movements and orientations of the fish. Regarding the second challenge and after comparing between different object detection systems, YOLOv3 was chosen as it proved to achieve high accuracy among other systems. The proposed approach scored 76.81% using (mean average precision) mAP as an accuracy metric and 89.17% using F-score, which is considered one of the most accurate outcomes among the literature.

One of these tasks is classifying interference problems affecting Uplink (UL) channel into different types. The interference classification problem can be formulated as an image classification task by converting the signal's power spectral density to an image. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) proved to have great success in image classification tasks. In this paper, different CNN architectures such as (VGG, MobileNet, RESNET) are used and assessed to classify the type of interference affecting the uplink channel in LTE. CNNs are characterized by their ability to detect and describe the abnormal behavior of UL channel which provided significant improvement over traditional rule-based systems.

The use of robots to perform assorted tasks is evident in difficult, uncompromising, and hazardous spaces and sectors such as manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, landmines, mining, patrolling, disaster relief etc. For a robot to carry out its assigned task, it normally has to navigate safely without collisions to different locations, which also means understanding its working environment, collectively known as the robot navigation problem. This paper considers finding a solution using neural networks to the robot navigation problem, particularly the path planning problem that includes fixed obstacles. The objective of the path planning problem is to find a route to the final destination that is optimal and also collision-free. Different training algorithms and network structures are used to construct models that can predict a turning angle for the point-mass robot which will be used to avoid obstacles in the robot's path to the destination. This paper will present a comparative analysis of the performance of different feedforward neural network models. The results suggest that the feedforward neural network model with 10 neurons and Bayesian regularization performed the best. The model has been used to avoid obstacles in two different environments. The trajectories show that the robot has safely avoided obstacles in its path and reached the destination.","doi":"10.1109/NILES53778.2021.9600550","startPage":"210","endPage":"215","publicationTitle":"2021 3rd Novel Intelligent and Leading Emerging Sciences Conference (NILES)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NILES53778.2021.9600550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9600086","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 3rd Novel Intelligent and Leading Emerging Sciences Conference (NILES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9600478/9600086/09600550.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Obstacle Avoidance of a Point-Mass Robot using Feedforward Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9600550/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Obstacle Avoidance of a Point-Mass Robot using Feedforward Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9600550/","publicationDate":"23 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2021","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Obstacle Avoidance of a Point-Mass Robot using Feedforward Neural Network","confLoc":"Giza, Egypt","sourcePdf":"NILES2021_73.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072043S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9600478","isNumber":"9600086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9600478","xplore-issue":"9600086","articleId":"9600550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9600613,"authors":[{"name":"Onursal \u00c7etin","affiliation":["Band\u00fdrma Onyedi Eyl\u00fcl University, Band\u00fdrma, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/9653691/9600613/cetin-3123064-small.gif","p":["Onursal \u00c7etin was born in Kayseri, Turkey, in 1982.

The energy applied to the launcher is converted into magnetic energy in the coil and then into motion energy. The object to be launched follows the magnetic field created in one or more fixed coils. The coil can be fed by direct current (dc) or alternative current (ac) source. In dc systems, the capacitor charging time delays the serial launch. In ac systems, the absence of capacitors enables serial launching. In this study, the application of an ac electromagnetic launch system, which provides a serial launch, is proposed. The maximum force acting on the projectile can be achieved by timely cutting off the energy applied to the coil. Therefore, in electromagnetic launchers, it is critical to know the position of the projectile in the coil. In launcher systems fed with alternating current, the projectile position can be predicted from current changes without the need for an additional setup. In the study, TMS320F28335 digital signal processor (DSP) microprocessor with high processing capacity was used to detect the trigger moment from coil current. Time-delayed artificial neural network was used to estimate the position of the projectile within the coil by using the obtained current differences. The normalized values of the current differences were applied to the time-delayed multilayer neural network (MLNN) algorithm and the projectile position was estimated with 94.67% accuracy. The proposed system increases efficiency compared to systems using conventional sensors, as it prevents or reduces the retraction force.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9600613/","volume":"49","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9600613/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"An Experimental Study on Sensorless Determination of the Projectile Position by Artificial Neural Network in Magnetic Launcher Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Band\u00fdrma Onyedi Eyl\u00fcl University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit","grantNumber":"BAP-18-MF-1003-003 and BAP-19-1003-004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Experimental Study on Sensorless Determination of the Projectile Position by Artificial Neural Network in Magnetic Launcher Systems","sourcePdf":"tps-dalcali-3123064-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070452S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"9653691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","xplore-issue":"9653691","articleId":"9600613","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9600618,"authors":[{"name":"Hyungmin Cho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9603995/9600618/cho-3124125-small.gif","p":["Hyungmin Cho received the BS degree in computer science engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2005, and the MS and PhD degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, California, in 2010 and 2015, respectively.

However, a large batch size may not be ideal for some situations, such as aiming at low latency, training on edge/mobile devices, partial retraining for personalization, and having irregular input sequence lengths. GPU performance suffers from low utilization especially for small-batch recurrent neural network (RNN) applications where sequential computations are required. In this article, we propose a hybrid architecture, called FARNN, which combines a GPU and an FPGA to accelerate RNN computation for small batch sizes. After separating RNN computations into GPU-efficient and GPU-inefficient tasks, we design special FPGA computation units that accelerate the GPU-inefficient RNN tasks. FARNN off-loads the GPU-inefficient tasks to the FPGA. We evaluate FARNN with synthetic RNN layers of various configurations on the Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGA and the NVIDIA P100 GPU in addition to evaluating it with real RNN applications.

Using a large amount of real-world historical data containing 6423 consecutive EAF heats collected from a melt shop this work not only creates machine learning models for both EAF and ladle furnaces but also simultaneously minimises the total scrap cost and EAF energy consumption per ton of scrap.

photonic-assisted crosstalk cancellation approach for twin-single sideband (twin-SSB) radio over fiber (RoF) transmission is proposed by utilizing a dual polarization-dual derive Mach Zehnder modulator. By properly adjusting polarization controller in the transmitter, the crosstalk between the right side band signal and left side band signal of twin-SSB signal can be cancelled, which indicates the background noise of twin-SSB signal can be much more mitigated. A theoretical analysis is presented and validated by a simulation. The results show that crosstalk suppression ratios of about 42 dB for single frequency signal and about 30 dB for broadband signal are achieved in our proposed twin-SSB RoF system. Compared with the conventional twin-SSB RoF system, the crosstalk suppression ratio of proposed system is increased by about 22 dB for single frequency signal or 10 dB for broadband signal and the proposed system can reduce the error vector magnitude by about 10% and 11% in back-to-back case and 30 km single mode fiber transmission.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3125340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09600843.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"108","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3125340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Photonic-Assisted Crosstalk Cancellation for Twin-SSB Radio Over Fiber Transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"A Photonic-Assisted Crosstalk Cancellation for Twin-SSB Radio Over Fiber Transmission","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9600843/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9600843/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U2006217 and 61775015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2021JBZ103"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Photonic-Assisted Crosstalk Cancellation for Twin-SSB Radio Over Fiber Transmission","sourcePdf":"lcomm-wang-3125340-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042457S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9674048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9674048","articleId":"9600843","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9600844,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Guo","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Transportation Data Analysis and Mining, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Guo","orcid":"0000-0002-9330-4470"},{"name":"Gongpu Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Transportation Data Analysis and Mining, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gongpu","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-5346-3162"},{"name":"Rongtao Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rongtao","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Ruisi He","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruisi","lastName":"He","orcid":"0000-0003-4135-3227"},{"name":"Xusheng Wei","affiliation":["VIVO Mobile Company, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xusheng","lastName":"Wei"},{"name":"Chintha Tellambura","affiliation":["University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Chintha","lastName":"Tellambura","orcid":"0000-0002-9419-7195"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9600844","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9600844","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Symbiosis","Sensitivity","Backscatter","Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Channel capacity","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ambient backscatter","channel capacity","energy harvesting","sensitivity","symbiotic communication"]}],"abstract":"Wireless symbiotic communication is an emerging green technology for Internet of Things (IoT), where batteryless devices harvest energy from ambient radio frequency (RF) signals and use backscatter technology for communications.

Specifically, we first build up the mathematical model for the wireless symbiotic communication system, then derive its channel capacity considering the sensitivity constraint, and compare the capacity performance with the existing symbiotic communication systems without sensitivity constraint and also the traditional point-to-point systems. Simulations are then provided to corroborate our proposed studies.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3125342","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09600844.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"48","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3125342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Analysis for Wireless Symbiotic Communication Systems With BPSK Tags Under Sensitivity Constraint","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Analysis for Wireless Symbiotic Communication Systems With BPSK Tags Under Sensitivity Constraint","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9600844/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9600844/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2018B010124001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"NSFC: U1834210, 61871026 and 61725101"},{"fundingName":"ZTE Corporation, and State Key Laboratory of Mobile Network and Mobile Multimedia Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Analysis for Wireless Symbiotic Communication Systems With BPSK Tags Under Sensitivity Constraint","sourcePdf":"lcomm-guo-3125342-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063116S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9674048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9674048","articleId":"9600844","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9600846,"authors":[{"name":"Aparna Behara","affiliation":["IIT Madras, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Aparna","lastName":"Behara","orcid":"0000-0002-5302-8141"},{"name":"T.

Specifically, underwater and underground media are known to absorb electromagnetic radiation, which heavily affects the overall path loss. Industrial and disaster environments can be viewed as rich scattering environments with corresponding substantial multipath propagation leading to intersymbol interference and deterioration of signal quality. Although the challenges for the design of communication networks, and specifically the Internet of Things (IoT), in such environments are known, there is no common enabler or solution for all these applications. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been introduced to improve the signal propagation characteristics by focusing the signal power in the preferred direction, thus making the communication environment \u2019smart\u2019. While the usual application of RIS is related to blockage avoidance, the very same technique can be used to reduce the effect of multipath and even partially compensate the signal absorption via passive beamforming. Due to the beneficial properties of RIS, its use in challenging environments can become the aforementioned enabler and a game changing technology. However, various aspects of RIS deployment and system design need to be addressed in order to fully benefit from this technology. In this paper, we discuss potential use cases, deployment strategies and design aspects for RIS devices in underwater IoT, underground IoT as well as Industry 4.0 and emergency networks. Furthermore, we provide a potential hardware architecture and derive the expected signal quality improvements with increasing number of RIS elements. The numerical results reveal substantial performance gains of up to 20 dB per decade. In addition, novel research challenges to be addressed in this context are described.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3125461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","startPage":"150214","endPage":"150233","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09600850.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Challenging Environments: Underwater, Underground, Industrial and Disaster","topic":"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Communications for 6G and Beyond","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9600850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9600850/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Challenging Environments: Underwater, Underground, Industrial and Disaster","publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001866","fundingName":"Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) through the CORE Project","grantNumber":"RISOTTI C20/IS/14773976"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Challenging Environments: Underwater, Underground, Industrial and Disaster","sourcePdf":"access-kisseleff-3125461-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.191336S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","topics":["Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Communications for 6G and Beyond"],"articleId":"9600850","onlineDate":"08 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":9600852,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunjin Ahn","affiliation":["Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9600852/ahn-3125349-small.gif","p":["Hyunjin Ahn (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the combined M.S./Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","He was an Intern with Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, where he was involved in the development of power amplifier (PA) and passive circuits for 5G applications.

The proposed linear PA employs a compact symmetrical 4-way parallel\u2013parallel power combiner with a third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) cancellation method to achieve high linear output power with a high power-added efficiency (PAE). An on-chip 4-way parallel\u2013parallel power combiner, which combines the output power from 8-unit PAs, is designed with a compact footprint (\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$241\\,\\,\\mu \\text{m}\\,\\,\\times 241\\,\\,\\mu \\text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n). Conventional series power-combining transformer based power combiners have poor symmetrical performance for the amplitude and phase of the input impedance among unit PAs owing to the parasitic effects of the power combiners. However, the proposed parallel\u2013parallel power combiner, which is based on parallel power-combining transformer structures, shows good symmetrical performances among unit PAs. Moreover, an IMD3 cancellation method using a parallel\u2013parallel power combiner is proposed in this work. The proposed IMD3 cancellation method can support high-order modulation signals without increasing the complexity and reduce the dependence for digital predistortion (DPD). Consequently, the proposed linearization method obtains a high linear P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">OUT</sub>\n and PAE without DPD.

A standing challenge for the applicability of on- device intelligence is the excessively high computation cost of training highly accurate Deep Learning (DL) models. These models require a large number of training iterations to reach a high convergence accuracy, hindering their applicability to resource-constrained embedded devices. This paper proposes a novel transformation which changes the topology of the DL architecture to reach an optimal cross-layer connectivity. This, in turn, significantly reduces the number of training iterations required for reaching a target accuracy. Our transformation leverages the important observation that for a set level of accuracy, convergence is fastest when network topology reaches the boundary of a Small-World Network. Small-world graphs are known to possess a specific connectivity structure that enables enhanced signal propagation among nodes. Our small-world models, called SWANNs, provide several intriguing benefits: they facilitate data (gradient) flow within the network, enable feature-map reuse by adding long-range connections and accommodate various network architectures/datasets. Compared to densely connected networks (e.g., DenseNets), SWANNs require a substantially fewer number of training parameters while maintaining a similar level of classification accuracy. We evaluate our networks on various DL model architectures and image classification datasets, namely, MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet.

However, DNN hardware implementation is challenging due to the high computational complexity and diverse dataflow in different DNN models. To mitigate this design challenge, a large body of research has focused on accelerating specific DNN models or layers and proposed dedicated designs. However, dedicated designs for specific DNN models or layers limit the design flexibility. In this work, we take advantage of the similarity among different DNN models and propose a novel Lego-based Deep Neural Network on a Chip (\n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DNNoC</i>\n) design methodology.

The proposed design methodology allows leveraging different DNN model implementations, helping to reduce implementation cost and time-to-market.

The load data for this research work is taken by each of 30 minutes in a day for each four weeks earlier in the past to predict the following week's load. To examine the efficacy of the proposed method, the Sulawesi and Java-Bali Sub System Load are utilized in this paper. The simulation result shows that the LSTM with 1-input has similar performance to ANN-PSO in MAPE value and slightly superior performance in RMSE at Java Bali Sub System Load. At Sulawesi Sub System Load, it is shown that LSTM with 1-input is superior to all performance parameters compared to 3-input LSTM, have a little lower performance to Java Bali prediction about 1.03% on MAPE value, but perform better performance up to 45.08 on RSME value. Although the performance of LSTM is different in each case, the simulation result shown the capability of LSTM as an additional reference in performing short-term load forecasting on the electricity system.","doi":"10.1109/ICT-PEP53949.2021.9601005","pdfPath":"/iel7/9600869/9600895/09601005.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"179","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Technology and Policy in Energy and Electric Power (ICT-PEP)","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Technology and Policy in Energy and Electric Power (ICT-PEP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICT-PEP53949.2021.9601005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9600895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Term Load Forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory Network on Various Sub System Load in PLN Indonesia","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9601005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Short-Term Load Forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory Network on Various Sub System Load in PLN Indonesia","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2021","publicationDate":"29 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9601005/","conferenceDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term Load Forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory Network on Various Sub System Load in PLN Indonesia","confLoc":"Jakarta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"m43272-indralaksono.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082141S","chronDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9600869","isNumber":"9600895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9600869","xplore-issue":"9600895","articleId":"9601005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9601021,"authors":[{"name":"Izzuddin Fathin Azhar","affiliation":["Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Izzuddin Fathin","lastName":"Azhar","id":"37088552454"},{"name":"Lesnanto Multa Putranto","affiliation":["Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Lesnanto Multa","lastName":"Putranto","id":"37071718300"},{"name":"Roni Irnawan","affiliation":["Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Roni","lastName":"Irnawan","id":"37085819107"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1641-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1642-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9601021","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Time series analysis","Power system stability","Phasor measurement units","Stability analysis","Power system reliability","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["transient stability","deep learning","convolutional neural network","long-short term memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9601021","abstract":"The development of electric power systems in the future will be more complex. Because of that, for the electric power system's operation to remain reliable, monitoring technology or algorithms is needed to support more advanced information delivery. One of the technologies used is the phasor measurement unit (PMU). The more PMUs used in the electric power system network, the more data will be generated from the PMU because the PMU has a high data sample resolution and is able to observe transient conditions. This paper discussed the transient stability prediction using CNN-LSTM for time step prediction using PMU data. The proposed method is used for predicting stable and unstable cases in time series data. The research focuses on stability conditions due to network changes, such as line detachment and out-of-step protection on generators when there is a loss of synchronism after the occurrence of three-phase fault. The proposed method is simulated using IEEE 39 bus test system in DIgSILENT PowerFactory. The resulting model can reach an accuracy of 99.62%, with an average time of simulation per epoch is 247 s. The proposed method has a higher accuracy than the CNN and convLSTM methods and can overcome the weakness of the CNN method which consumes a lot of time during the training process.","doi":"10.1109/ICT-PEP53949.2021.9601021","pdfPath":"/iel7/9600869/9600895/09601021.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"141","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Technology and Policy in Energy and Electric Power (ICT-PEP)","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Technology and Policy in Energy and Electric Power (ICT-PEP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICT-PEP53949.2021.9601021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9600895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient Stability Detection Using CNN-LSTM Considering Time Frame of Observation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9601021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Transient Stability Detection Using CNN-LSTM Considering Time Frame of Observation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2021","publicationDate":"29 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9601021/","conferenceDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012521","fundingName":"Universitas Gadjah Mada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient Stability Detection Using CNN-LSTM Considering Time Frame of Observation","confLoc":"Jakarta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"m40793-azhar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126443S","chronDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9600869","isNumber":"9600895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9600869","xplore-issue":"9600895","articleId":"9601021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9601094,"authors":[{"name":"Barman Mandal Soma","firstName":"Barman Mandal","lastName":"Soma"},{"name":"Acharya Moumita","firstName":"Acharya","lastName":"Moumita"},{"name":"Basu Samik","firstName":"Basu","lastName":"Samik"},{"name":"Chakrabarti Amlan","firstName":"Chakrabarti","lastName":"Amlan"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1992-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1993-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9601094","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9601094","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Drugs","Biological system modeling","Stochastic processes","Tools","Very large scale integration","Synthetic biology","Libraries"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synthetic Biology","Biochemical Reaction","ODE","System Generator","FPGA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VDAT53777.2021.9601094","publicationTitle":"2021 25th International Symposium on VLSI Design and Test (VDAT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 25th International Symposium on VLSI Design and Test (VDAT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9600867/9600899/09601094.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VDAT53777.2021.9601094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9600899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Different Stochastic Biochemical Reactions Involved in a Cell","abstract":"System and synthetic biology, the two emerging interdisciplinary sciences are important to study the complex behavior of a biological system or to discover new drugs or predict diseases.

Although GCN performs well compared with other methods, it still faces challenges. Training a GCN model for large-scale graphs in a conventional way requires high computation and storage costs. Therefore, motivated by an urgent need in terms of efficiency and scalability in training GCN, sampling methods have been proposed and achieved a significant effect. In this paper, we categorize sampling methods based on the sampling mechanisms and provide a comprehensive survey of sampling methods for efficient training of GCN. To highlight the characteristics and differences of sampling methods, we present a detailed comparison within each category and further give an overall comparative analysis for the sampling methods in all categories. Finally, we discuss some challenges and future research directions of the sampling methods.","doi":"10.1109/JAS.2021.1004311","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570654/9601147/09601152.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"234","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica","publicationTitle":"IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JAS.2021.1004311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9601147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling Methods for Efficient Training of Graph Convolutional Networks: A Survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9601152/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Sampling Methods for Efficient Training of Graph Convolutional Networks: A Survey","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"February 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9601152/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61732018,61872335,61802367,61876215"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling Methods for Efficient Training of Graph Convolutional Networks: A Survey","sourcePdf":"JAS090201.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.202722S","chronDate":"February  2022","xplore-pub-id":"6570654","isNumber":"9601147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570654","xplore-issue":"9601147","articleId":"9601152","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9601158,"authors":[{"name":"Taejoong Song","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9664397/9601158/song-3123077-small.gif","p":["Taejoong Song (Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2010.","He heads the Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO), Library IP, Samsung Foundry, Hwaseong, South Korea.

However, it is implausible to collect sufficient real-world samples with dense and clear ground-truth disparity maps in practice. Although synthetic datasets\u2019 appearance has alleviated the demand for extensive real data, there is a domain shift between synthetic and real sets. To tackle this problem, we propose an individually trained synthetic-to-real domain adaptation (SDA) network that maps synthetic images into the real domain. Specifically, our approach translates the data style from synthetic domain to real domain while maintaining the content and the spatial information. First, edge cues are leveraged to guide domain adaptation in preserving the spatial consistency between input and the generated image. Second, we combine the spatial feature transform (SFT) layer to effectively fuse features from the edge map and the source image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: 1) when only trained on synthetic data and generalized to real data, our model evidently outperforms many state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods; 2) our translated synthetic datasets (TSD) help to improve the generalization capability of any stereo matching CNNs.

One main limitation of FedAvg is that the average-based global model is not necessarily better than local models in the early stage of the training process so that FedAvg might diverge in realistic scenarios, especially when the data is non-identically distributed across devices and the number of data samples varies significantly from device to device. In this paper, we propose a new FL technique based on simulated annealing. The key idea of the proposed technique, henceforth referred to as \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">simulated annealing-based FL</i>\n (SAFL), is to allow a device to choose its local model when the global model is immature. Specifically, by exploiting the simulated annealing strategy, we make each device choose its local model with high probability in early iterations when the global model is immature. From extensive numerical experiments using various benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that SAFL outperforms the conventional FedAvg technique in terms of the convergence speed and the classification accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gradual Federated Learning With Simulated Annealing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3125137","endPage":"6313","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09601226.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"6299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3125137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9601226","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Data models","Numerical models","Predictive models","Computational modeling","Simulated annealing","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Client-server systems","distributed algorithms","federated learning","machine learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gradual Federated Learning With Simulated Annealing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9601226/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","volume":"69","htmlLink":"/document/9601226/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NRF","grantNumber":"MSIT 2020R1A2C2102198"},{"fundingName":"Korea government"},{"fundingName":"Samsung Research Funding & Incubation Center for Future Technology of Samsung Electronics","grantNumber":"SRFC-IT1901-17"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gradual Federated Learning With Simulated Annealing","sourcePdf":"tsp-shim-3125137-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093892S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9601226","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9601229,"authors":[{"name":"Itai E.

Direct sequence spread spectrum technology enables a code division multiple access (CDMA) system a strong anti-interference capability but with a relatively low spectrum efficiency. To address this issue, complementary coded scrambling multiple access (CCSMA) (X. Liu \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">et al</i>\n., in 2018) was proposed to use three-dimensional (space-time-frequency) resources for performance enhancement. However, in a CCSMA system, if the number of multipath returns is larger than the number of transmit (Tx) antennas, a code reuse problem occurs to degrade bit error rate performance significantly. This work designs a new scrambling code, namely generalized complementary coded scrambling multiple access (GCCSMA) codes, to overcome the code reuse problem in CCSMA. GCCSMA uses complementary codes, scrambling modulation, and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) techniques jointly, which works well even in multipath channels with more paths than the number of Tx antennas. The analysis and simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed GCCSMA system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Antennas","Multiaccess communication","Wireless communication","MIMO communication","Interference","NOMA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple access","GCCSMA","MIMO","Scrambling modulation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9655601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2021.3125029","startPage":"13047","endPage":"13061","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/9655601/09601230.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2021.3125029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Complementary Coded Scrambling Multiple Access for MIMO Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Generalized Complementary Coded Scrambling Multiple Access for MIMO Communications","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","volume":"70","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9601230/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9601230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1764263, 61671186 and 61901315"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2020RC08"},{"fundingName":"Taiwan Ministry of Science & Technology","grantNumber":"109-2221-E-006-175-MY3 and 109-2221-E-006-182-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Complementary Coded Scrambling Multiple Access for MIMO Communications","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-3125029-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113004S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"9655601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"9655601","articleId":"9601230","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":9601233,"authors":[{"name":"Maher Al-Shoukairi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, California, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Maher","lastName":"Al-Shoukairi","orcid":"0000-0002-5808-9947","id":"37085552985"},{"name":"Bhaskar D.

This paper applies multi-stage learning to speech enhancement by using a multi-stage structure, where each stage comprises a self-attention (SA) block followed by stacks of temporal convolutional network (TCN) blocks with doubling dilation factors. Each stage generates a prediction that is refined in a subsequent stage. A feature fusion block is inserted at the input of later stages to re-inject original information. The resulting multi-stage speech enhancement system, multi-stage SA-TCN, is compared with state-of-the-art deep-learning speech enhancement methods using the LibriSpeech and VCTK datasets. The multi-stage SA-TCN system\u2019s hyperparameters are fine-tuned, and the impact of the SA block, the feature fusion block, and the number of stages are determined. The use of a multi-stage SA-TCN system as a front-end for automatic speech recognition systems is also investigated.

Recently, the method of dividing the samples into easy and hard ones effectively optimizes the margin-based loss function by emphasizing these two parts at different training stages. However, the hard samples contain not only intra-personal variations that can be easily misclassified but also wrong-labeled samples. To capture and distinguish their difference, an EnhanceFace method is proposed with a new adaptive weighted loss function in this letter to improve the accuracy of face recognition. Firstly, this method partitions the hard samples into semi-hard and harder samples. Then, a new loss function is developed to adaptively adjust corresponding weights for both semi-hard samples and harder samples during the training process. With this new loss function, their effects can be well balanced according to their importance. The EnhanceFace method is tested on different popular benchmarks. Finally, better performance is shown by the experimental results comparing with other state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3125267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9686799/09601307.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3125267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"EnhanceFace: Adaptive Weighted SoftMax Loss for Deep Face Recognition","volume":"29","htmlLink":"/document/9601307/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9601307/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41771375, 31860182 and 41961053"},{"fundingName":"Scientific and Technological Innovation Talent in the universities of Henan Province","grantNumber":"22HASTIT015"},{"fundingName":"Henan Association for Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2020hytp013"},{"fundingName":"Youth key teacher of Henan","grantNumber":"2020GGJS030"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EnhanceFace: Adaptive Weighted SoftMax Loss for Deep Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"lsp-zheng-3125267-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064903S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9686799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9686799","articleId":"9601307","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9601367,"authors":[{"name":"Yiqun Dong","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yiqun","lastName":"Dong","id":"37088494632"},{"name":"Jiongran Wen","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jiongran","lastName":"Wen","id":"37089170644"},{"name":"Youmin Zhang","affiliation":["Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Youmin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405807400"},{"name":"Jianliang Ai","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jianliang","lastName":"Ai","id":"37086448794"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4089-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3129-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-9439"}],"articleNumber":"9601367","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Atmospheric modeling","Fault detection","Kinematics","Robustness","Mathematical models","Sensors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Air Data Sensors","Deep Neural Networks","Fault Detection","Inertial Reference Unit","Kinematic Relations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9601367","abstract":"A deep neural networks (DNN) based fault detection (FD) scheme for aircraft air data sensors (ADS) is proposed.

Whilst ADS fault cases are exported directly in the process, the inputs to the mapping involve the ADS outputs, and other measurable states including accelerations/angular speeds along different axes of the aircraft body. We adopt both convolutional neural network and long-short time memory blocks to construct the mapping. We detail the database that is established in training the DNN. Training history and testing results of the DNN are also illustrated. Testing performances of the proposed DNN -based FD scheme present itself promising with the high FD accuracy and robustness to different aircraft/flight conditions.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9601367","startPage":"442","endPage":"447","publicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9601367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9601344","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9601162/9601344/09601367.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Neural Networks-based Air Data Sensors Fault Detection for Aircraft","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9601367/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deep Neural Networks-based Air Data Sensors Fault Detection for Aircraft","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9601367/","publicationDate":"22 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Neural Networks-based Air Data Sensors Fault Detection for Aircraft","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"RP-0076-SatA09-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091387S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9601162","isNumber":"9601344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9601162","xplore-issue":"9601344","articleId":"9601367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9601380,"authors":[{"name":"Dapeng Niu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Dapeng","lastName":"Niu","id":"37700912800"},{"name":"Zicheng Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Zicheng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37089171852"},{"name":"Mingxing Jia","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Mingxing","lastName":"Jia","id":"37089167266"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4089-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3129-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-9439"}],"articleNumber":"9601380","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulation","Neural networks","Fitting","Sociology","Process control","Evolutionary computation","Statistics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interval Neural Network","Evolution Operation","Interval Arithmetic","Differential Evolution Algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9601380","abstract":"To solve the problems of slow convergence speed, low precision and easily trapped into local extremum for traditional interval neural network, the evolutionary operation in JADE algorithm is extended to interval operation, and an improved interval differential evolution algorithm is proposed to express uncertain data in metallurgical process.

Due to its irregularity and disorder, the classification task of point clouds needs to transform the point cloud into a multi-view or voxel grid, and then use the traditional convolution neural network processing. However, this process is not only complex in operation but also low in classification accuracy. To solve this problem, a new point cloud classification method based on the graphical convolutional neural network (GCN) is proposed. Firstly, based on PointNet, KNN graph is introduced to obtain global deep features. Then the 3D point cloud is represented as a directed graph, local features are extracted by edge convolution. Finally, the extracted global and local features are aggregated to represent and classify point clouds. The proposed network is evaluated on the open dataset ModelNet40 and 3DMNIST. Experimental results show that the proposed network can achieve on par or better performance than state-of-the-art, such as PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PointCNN, for point cloud classification.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9601582","startPage":"1686","endPage":"1691","publicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9601582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9601344","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9601162/9601344/09601582.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Graphical Convolutional Network-based Method for 3D Point Cloud Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9601582/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Graphical Convolutional Network-based Method for 3D Point Cloud Classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9601582/","publicationDate":"22 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772050"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Graphical Convolutional Network-based Method for 3D Point Cloud Classification","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"RP-0292-SunAIS-56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072223S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9601162","isNumber":"9601344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9601162","xplore-issue":"9601344","articleId":"9601582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9601615,"authors":[{"name":"Huijun Guo","affiliation":["School of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an","Key Laboratory of Shaanxi Province for Complex System Control and Intelligent Information Processing, Xi'an"],"firstName":"Huijun","lastName":"Guo","id":"37086411402"},{"name":"Jintao Liang","affiliation":["Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Jintao","lastName":"Liang","id":"37088984611"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4089-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3129-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-9439"}],"articleNumber":"9601615","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9601615","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Network topology","Heuristic algorithms","Simulation","Control systems","Robustness","Topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consensus control","Multi-robot systems","Agent systems","Neural networks","Sliding mode control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9601615","pdfPath":"/iel7/9601162/9601344/09601615.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","startPage":"2614","endPage":"2619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9601344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9601615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive neural network consensus tracking control of multi-robot systems","abstract":"This paper studies the problem of distributed consensus tracking control for multi-robot systems with different friction coefficients and external disturbances based on the multi-agent theory.

Then, considering the neural networks time-delay, transmission delay and stochastic cyber-attacks, closed-loop switched augmented estimation error systems are established. By utilizing multiple Lyapunov functions, sufficient conditions that guarantee the mean-square exponential stability of closed-loop switched systems are given. Subsequently, the controller and observer gains and event-triggering parameters are obtained.

This paper proposes a weight initialization method based on rule partition for the fuzzy neural network to solve this problem. The connection weights between the membership function layer and the rule layer are initialized by classifying weight intervals according to different rules, which could reduce the similarity of fuzzy rules. Finally, the proposed method is verified by some experiments. The results show that the fuzzy neural network initialized by rule partition achieves better generalization performance, which proves the superiority of this method.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9601986","pdfPath":"/iel7/9601162/9601344/09601986.pdf","startPage":"6449","endPage":"6453","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","publicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9601986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9601344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A weight initialization method for fuzzy neural network based on rule partition","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9601986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2021","displayDocTitle":"A weight initialization method for fuzzy neural network based on rule partition","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","publicationDate":"22 May 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9601986/","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62021003,618930930-5"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A weight initialization method for fuzzy neural network based on rule partition","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"RP-1109-MonCIS-18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048517S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9601162","isNumber":"9601344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9601162","xplore-issue":"9601344","articleId":"9601986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9601987,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Wang","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Computer Science), Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089169528"},{"name":"Lianglin Xiong","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Lianglin","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37594406600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4089-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3129-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-9439"}],"articleNumber":"9601987","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["State feedback","Neural networks","Markov processes","Stability analysis","Delays","State estimation","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reduced-order state estimation","Complex-valued neural networks","Time-varying delay","Generally uncertain Markov jump"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9601987","abstract":"In this work, without dividing the complex-valued neutral networks (CVNNs) into a real component and an imaginary component, the partial states of CVNNs with time-varying delay and Markov jump are obtained by a reduced-order state estimator for the first time.

However, it is difficult to obtain uniform, clear and continuous structured light stripe by using general image denoising algorithm. To solve this problem, our paper adopts the method of combining Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) and Denoising Convolutional Neural Network-Ring Structured Light (DnCNN-RSL) to denoise. We first use DCGAN network to generate more data sets, and then use DnCNN-RSL network to denoise images so that noiseless images can be obtained. DnCNN-RSL network is suitable for removing the noise of small sample data sets, which reflects in improving PNSR value of images, and SSIM value is also closer to 1. Experiments show that DnCNN-RSL network can get better denoising results than traditional image processing methods and obtain clear, continuous structured light stripe. In this way depth information obtained by denoised structured light stripe is more accurate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9602115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9602115/","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","publicationDate":"22 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Convolutional Neural Network for Small Sample's Ring Structured Light Denoising","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Convolutional Neural Network for Small Sample's Ring Structured Light Denoising","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"RP-0186-SunA03-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059806S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9601162","isNumber":"9601344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9601162","xplore-issue":"9601344","articleId":"9602115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":9602141,"authors":[{"name":"Linming Zou","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Linming","lastName":"Zou","id":"37089172677"},{"name":"Yonggui Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yonggui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37077994800"},{"name":"Jiachen Huang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiachen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37089172366"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4089-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3129-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-9439"}],"articleNumber":"9602141","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Vibrations","Training","Temperature sensors","Temperature measurement","Temperature","Time series analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Crack detection","Deep neural network","Structural health monitoring system","Finite element model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9602141","abstract":"Crack is an important damaged feature of structures in civil infrastructure which needs to be detected before disastrous accident. Simply, damaged severity of structures may vary from different crack lengths which results in changes of vibration characteristics. In structural health monitoring system (SHM), the vibration-based method to detect damage in structures attracts considerable attention. This paper aims at introducing a novel framework by using deep neural network to do some crack recognition and classification tasks. The crack damage was simulated with a finite element model of a simply supported beam monitored by a group of acceleration sensors. Mulitiple vibration data was fed into designed framework for training and testing. The results are compared with fully convolutional networks (FCN), residual network (ResNet), long short-term memory network (LSTM) and bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) that are well-performed in tackling time series problems. The experiments show that crack damage is correctly detected and classificated using the monitoring data with 3% accuracy improving at least compared with those four methods. Finally, we apply the proposed framework to an SHM and visualize the results on PC via the Internet cloud techniques.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9602141","startPage":"7112","endPage":"7117","publicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9602141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9601344","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9601162/9601344/09602141.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crack Detection and Classification of a Simulated Beam Using Deep Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9602141/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Crack Detection and Classification of a Simulated Beam Using Deep Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9602141/","publicationDate":"22 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2016A030313510"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crack Detection and Classification of a Simulated Beam Using Deep Neural Network","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"RP-1224-MonD09-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060379S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9601162","isNumber":"9601344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9601162","xplore-issue":"9601344","articleId":"9602141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9602175,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhuang Cai","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Huaqiao University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Jianhuang","lastName":"Cai","id":"37089167039"},{"name":"Qingshan Feng","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Huaqiao University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Qingshan","lastName":"Feng","id":"37089171284"},{"name":"Dongsheng Guo","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Huaqiao University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Dongsheng","lastName":"Guo","id":"37532174300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4089-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3129-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-9439"}],"articleNumber":"9602175","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9602175","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Neural networks","Taylor series","Manipulators","Mathematical models","Numerical models","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete-time zeroing neural network (DTZNN)","system of linear equation and inequality","time-varying","Taylor-type difference formula","numerical validation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9602175","pdfPath":"/iel7/9601162/9601344/09602175.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","startPage":"3806","endPage":"3811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9601344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9602175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Discrete-Time Zeroing Neural Network for Solving Time-Varying System of Linear Equation and Inequality","abstract":"Recently, the zeroing neural network (ZNN) model with continues-time form has been established to solve the time-varying system of linear equation and inequality.

The simulation also shows both models have a good robustness on the transition process after a fault occurs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9602313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9602313/","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","publicationDate":"22 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Comparative Study for Multilayer Perception versus Convolutional Neural Network Based On the Wind Turbine Benchmark Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparative Study for Multilayer Perception versus Convolutional Neural Network Based On the Wind Turbine Benchmark Model","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"RP-0631-SunD06-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069924S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9601162","isNumber":"9601344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9601162","xplore-issue":"9601344","articleId":"9602313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":9602353,"authors":[{"name":"Tangjie Wu","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei"],"firstName":"Tangjie","lastName":"Wu","id":"37089173721"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37965548400"},{"name":"Haitao Huang","affiliation":["Feng Huo Tai Technology Ltd., Hefei"],"firstName":"Haitao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37089173199"},{"name":"Zefeng Lai","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei"],"firstName":"Zefeng","lastName":"Lai","id":"37089174578"},{"name":"Qiang Ling","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Ling","id":"37089166422"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4089-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3129-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-9439"}],"articleNumber":"9602353","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hamming distance","Sociology","Genetics","Statistics","Task analysis","Genetic algorithms","Convergence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm","adaptive","multi-population","test paper generation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9602353","abstract":"Recently, online examination has well developped. As an essential task of online examination, test paper generation plays a critical role. Genetic algorithm has been used in test paper generation systems. However, traditional genetic algorithm is easy to be stuck at local optimal solutions and can not adapt well to the student's mastery of knowledge concepts. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-population Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (MAGA) for test paper generation. Our algorithm introduces the Longest Common Subsequence(LCS) and Hamming distance to judge genetic similarity and comprehensively considers the influence of evolutionary generation, fitness and genetic similarity on parameters of the proposed algorithm. MAGA constructs the initial population which is then fed into the crossover and mutation operators to be optimized and produce the optimal solution. We conducted experiments for the sequential test paper generation on the datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves significant improvement over traditional genetic algorithms with faster convergence speed and higher fitness.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9602353","pdfPath":"/iel7/9601162/9601344/09602353.pdf","startPage":"5157","endPage":"5162","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","publicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9602353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9601344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-population Adaptive Genetic Algorithm for Test Paper Generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9602353/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-population Adaptive Genetic Algorithm for Test Paper Generation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","publicationDate":"22 May 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9602353/","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-population Adaptive Genetic Algorithm for Test Paper Generation","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"RP-0891-MonB02-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090508S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9601162","isNumber":"9601344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9601162","xplore-issue":"9601344","articleId":"9602353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9602484,"authors":[{"name":"Euclides Louren\u00e7o Chuma","affiliation":["Unicamp University, Campinas, SP, Brazil"],"firstName":"Euclides Louren\u00e7o","lastName":"Chuma","id":"37086243940"},{"name":"Yuzo Iano","affiliation":["State University of Campinas, SP, Brazil"],"firstName":"Yuzo","lastName":"Iano","id":"37271420000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9358-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9359-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9602484","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9602484","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Privacy","Senior citizens","Robustness","Doppler radar","Convolutional neural networks","Doppler effect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["privacy","sensor","Doppler","deep learning","IoT"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel human movement recognition system using continuous-wave Doppler radar and deep learning with convolutional neural networks.

To solve the control problem of the system, a nonlinear model predictive (NMPC) controller based on nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous input neural network (NARXNN) is developed. At first, a boost pressure predictive model, of which fuel injection quantity is the first input and bypass valve opening is the second input, and the boost pressure is the output, is established based on NARXNN. Through simulation analysis, the absolute error between the output value of the plant model and the predictive model is smaller than 0.05 bar. Then the predictive accuracy of the predictive model when the predictive horizons are different is analyzed, and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is less than 2% when the predictive horizon is within 30, indicating that the predictive model has good multi-step predictive performance. At last, the NMPC controller based on the NMPC toolbox in MATLAB is established. And the the step response performance and reference-tracking performance of the controller are verified in the co-simulation platform formed by GT-Power and MATLAB/Simulink. It can be concluded from the results that the step response performance of the NMPC controller is better than that of the PID controller, and the relative error of the reference- tracking simulation is smaller than 15%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Atmospheric modeling","Diesel engines","Neural networks","Predictive models","Control systems","Mathematical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural network","Turbocharged diesel engine","NARXNN","Nonlinear model predictive control"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9601344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9602515","startPage":"5770","endPage":"5774","publicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9601162/9601344/09602515.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9602515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Two-stage Turbocharged Diesel Engine Air-path System","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Two-stage Turbocharged Diesel Engine Air-path System","publicationDate":"22 May 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9602515/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9602515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Two-stage Turbocharged Diesel Engine Air-path System","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"RP-0996-MonBIS49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102876S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9601162","isNumber":"9601344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9601162","xplore-issue":"9601344","articleId":"9602515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":9602537,"authors":[{"name":"Changqing Long","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Changqing","lastName":"Long","id":"37089172025"},{"name":"Guodong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Guodong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38247940700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4089-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3129-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-9439"}],"articleNumber":"9602537","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Stability criteria","Delays","Numerical models","Synchronization","Adaptive control","Numerical stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anti-synchronization control","Complex-valued neural networks","Unbounded time-varying delays","Lyapunov stability theory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9602537","abstract":"This article discusses the anti-synchronization control problem of a class of complex-valued neural networks with unbounded time-varying delays.

An accurate model is essential in the study of the PEA's hysteresis. In this paper, a modified nonlinear autoregressive with external input (NARX) neural network is proposed to predict the output of PEAs. Different from the traditional NARX neural network, the input rate is integrated into the neural network as an additional input. This modification helps to account for the rate-dependence of the PEA's hysteresis. Experiments are carried out on a commercial PEA, where a 1\u2013100 Hz swept sinusoidal signal is utilized in the parameter identifications. Further, a sinusoidal signal with descending amplitude and a 1\u2013300 Hz swept sinusoidal signal are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model in modeling the PEA's hysteresis. Experimental results show that both the RMS and maximum errors of modified NARX neural network are smaller than traditional NARX network, especially for high-frequency signals and amplitude-varying signals. The proposed modified NARX neural network achieves higher flexibility and accuracy in the bandwidth of 300 Hz, and thus is a promising hysteresis model for PEAs.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9602677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9602677","startPage":"7033","endPage":"7038","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9601162/9601344/09602677.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9601344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Bandwidth Hysteresis Modeling of Piezoelectric Actuators Based on Modified NARX Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2021","displayDocTitle":"High-Bandwidth Hysteresis Modeling of Piezoelectric Actuators Based on Modified NARX Neural Network","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2021","publicationDate":"22 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9602677/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9602677/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Bandwidth Hysteresis Modeling of Piezoelectric Actuators Based on Modified NARX Neural Network","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"RP-1211-MonD07-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059611S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9601162","isNumber":"9601344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9601162","xplore-issue":"9601344","articleId":"9602677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":9602688,"authors":[{"name":"Yaoqun Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Engineering, Harbin University of Commerce, Harbin","Institute of System Engineering, Harbin University of Commerce, Harbin"],"firstName":"Yaoqun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37277723200"},{"name":"Zhenhua Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Engineering, Harbin University of Commerce, Harbin"],"firstName":"Zhenhua","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088983803"},{"name":"Xinxin Zhen","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Engineering, Harbin University of Commerce, Harbin"],"firstName":"Xinxin","lastName":"Zhen","id":"37088987334"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4089-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3129-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-9439"}],"articleNumber":"9602688","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Simulation","Neurons","Detectors","Simulated annealing","Traveling salesman problems","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chaotic neural network","Legendre function","Code division multiple access","Traveling salesman problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9602688","abstract":"As to the monotonous activation funcation of chaotic neural network, a new transient chaotic neuron model is constructed by combining multiple Legendre polynomials and sigmoid functions as a new non-monotonic excitation function, and the dynamic characteristics of chaotic neurons are analyzed.

First, the optimal PID controller design for the AVR system is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem. Then a new multi-objective state transition algorithm based on decomposition is used to find the Pareto optimal solutions. In order to prevent integral saturation and large oscillation of the controller, the PID controller output is constrained by integral separation method. Finally, the best compromise solution is obtained by using a multi-attribute decision making method named AHP-Entropy-TOPSIS.

For designed fast steering mirror driven by voice coil motors, considering the plant parameter uncertainty due to the unmodeled dynamics, an adaptive sliding mode controller with a robust term constructed based on the RBF neural network self-learning is proposed. The system identification indicates that RBF neural network (RBFNN) can achieve good approximation to the system parameters. Considering the output limitation, the input signal range is determined through the joint simulation of Adams and Matlab. The numerical simulation verifies that the proposed control scheme can achieve high-precision tracking performance. At the same time, the tests in two cases without input constraint and with input constraint are conducted. The test data illustrates that the developed control scheme with input constraints can better protect the FSM system.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9602782","startPage":"1927","endPage":"1932","publicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9602782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9601344","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9601162/9601344/09602782.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Sliding Mode Control for Fast Steering Mirror Based on RBF Neural Network Self-Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9602782/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Sliding Mode Control for Fast Steering Mirror Based on RBF Neural Network Self-Learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9602782/","publicationDate":"22 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61960206011,61633003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"JQ19017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Sliding Mode Control for Fast Steering Mirror Based on RBF Neural Network Self-Learning","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"RP-0335-SunB05-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060883S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9601162","isNumber":"9601344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9601162","xplore-issue":"9601344","articleId":"9602782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9602793,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Liang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering and Automations, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Liang","id":"37089165952"},{"name":"Zheng Chengyuan","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering and Automations, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Chengyuan","id":"37089171281"},{"name":"Zhao Zhengang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering and Automations, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Zhengang","id":"37089165054"},{"name":"Zhang Dacheng","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering and Automations, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming","Yunnan Key Laboratory of Computer Technology Application, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Dacheng","id":"38203194000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4089-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3129-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-9439"}],"articleNumber":"9602793","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9602793","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature distribution","Load forecasting","Power supplies","Neural networks","Time series analysis","Weather forecasting","Machine learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Short-term Load Forecasting","Time Series","Kalman Filter","Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9602793","pdfPath":"/iel7/9601162/9601344/09602793.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","startPage":"3747","endPage":"3751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9601344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9602793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-term Load Forecasting based on Kalman Filter and Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Network","abstract":"Power load forecasting is significant to research for power supply and strategy departments of electric power companies.

The shift model adapts to be the inverse model of running vehicle, with vehicle speed and engine speed acting as inputs while operation signals as outputs. To tackle the problem of mapping signals from sequence to sequence, the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm is adopted, imitating human operations on gas or clutch pedals during shift process.

Some practical tasks of radio spectrum awareness are related to signal detection and identification for improving the system\u2019s reliability, efficiency, and security. Eye diagrams are essential for measurement tools used by engineers to simulate, evaluate and debug systems. Eye diagrams reflect many vital parameters for signal integrity degradation, such as timing jitter, crosstalk, and inter-symbol interference. Therefore, using an eye diagram containing a valuable feature from the system could be helpful for spectrum awareness tasks. In this paper, we use deep learning to study and identify classes within quadrature amplitude modulation using eye diagrams and explored related impacts to enable radio spectrum awareness. Our results show that deep learning neural networks capable of classifying quadrature amplitude modulation types with eye diagrams at presenting timing jitter and varying signal-to-noise ratios.","doi":"10.1109/WOCC53213.2021.9603028","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 30th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9601160/9602862/09603028.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 30th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC53213.2021.9603028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9602862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QAM Signal Classification and Timing Jitter Identification Based on Eye Diagrams and Deep Learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Timing jitter","Wireless communication","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Tools","Security","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["jitters","deep learning","eye-diagram","signal integrity","spectrum awareness","automatic modulation classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9603028/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"QAM Signal Classification and Timing Jitter Identification Based on Eye Diagrams and Deep Learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9603028/","publicationDate":"7 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QAM Signal Classification and Timing Jitter Identification Based on Eye Diagrams and Deep Learning","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p1-almarhabi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075715S","chronDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9601160","isNumber":"9602862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9601160","xplore-issue":"9602862","articleId":"9603028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9603049,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiao-Wen Fu","affiliation":["National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiao-Wen","lastName":"Fu","id":"37088893020"},{"name":"Ting-Yu Chen","affiliation":["National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ting-Yu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088895380"},{"name":"Cheng-Di Tsai","affiliation":["National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Di","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37088895971"},{"name":"Meng-Wei Shen","affiliation":["National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Meng-Wei","lastName":"Shen","id":"37089153428"},{"name":"Tsung-Chu Huang","affiliation":["National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Chu","lastName":"Huang","id":"38183099400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3328-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3329-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-8284"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2575-8276"}],"articleNumber":"9603049","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9603049","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Automation","Conferences","Computational modeling","Redundancy","Neural networks","Fault tolerant systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCE-TW52618.2021.9603049","pdfPath":"/iel7/9601161/9602869/09603049.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics-Taiwan (ICCE-TW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics-Taiwan (ICCE-TW)","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9602869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCE-TW52618.2021.9603049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AN-Coded Redundant Residue Number System for Reliable Neural Networks","abstract":"Residue Number Systems (RNS) can simultaneously improve computing acceleration, area reduction and power saving.

For example, Static Analysis Tools (SATs) report potential vulnerabilities by analyzing code patterns, and Software Metrics (SMs) can be used to predict vulnerabilities based on high-level characteristics of the code. In theory, both approaches can be applied from the early stages of the development process, but it is well known that they fail to detect critical vulnerabilities and raise a large number of false alarms. This paper studies the hypothesis of using Machine Learning (ML) to combine alerts from SATs with SMs to predict vulnerabilities in a large software project (under development for many years). In practice, we use four ML algorithms, alerts from two SATs, and a large number of SMs to predict whether a source code file is vulnerable or not (binary classification) and to predict the vulnerability category (multiclass classification). Results show that one can achieve either high precision or high recall, but not both at the same time. To understand the reason, we analyze and compare snippets of source code, demonstrating that vulnerable and non-vulnerable files share similar characteristics, making it hard to distinguish vulnerable from non-vulnerable code based on SAT alerts and SMs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Codes","Software metrics","Software algorithms","Static analysis","Machine learning","Tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Security","Vulnerability Detection","Static Code Analysis","Software Metrics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EDCC53658.2021.00008","publicationTitle":"2021 17th European Dependable Computing Conference (EDCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 17th European Dependable Computing Conference (EDCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9603280/9603430/09603695.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9603430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDCC53658.2021.00008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine Learning to Combine Static Analysis Alerts with Software Metrics to Detect Security Vulnerabilities: An Empirical Study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9603695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Machine Learning to Combine Static Analysis Alerts with Software Metrics to Detect Security Vulnerabilities: An Empirical Study","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9603695/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9603695/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006129","fundingName":"FCT","grantNumber":"2020.04503.BD,SFRH/BD/140221/2018,POCI-01-0145-FEDER-032504"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008530","fundingName":"ERDF","grantNumber":"POCI-01-0247-FEDER-045907"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine Learning to Combine Static Analysis Alerts with Software Metrics to Detect Security Vulnerabilities: An Empirical Study","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"367100a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10113S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9603280","isNumber":"9603430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9603280","xplore-issue":"9603430","articleId":"9603695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9603866,"authors":[{"name":"Yuyang Ji","affiliation":["Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yuyang","lastName":"Ji","id":"37089161306"},{"name":"Yanjun Ji","affiliation":["The Eastern Liaoning University, Dandong, China"],"firstName":"Yanjun","lastName":"Ji","id":"37089161309"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0232-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0233-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9603866","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Simulation","Software algorithms","Random access memory","Parity check codes","Hardware","Software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","LDPC","code","decode"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9603866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Implementation Method of LDPC Efficient Decoding Based on FPGA","doi":"10.1109/ICNISC54316.2021.00017","startPage":"48","endPage":"53","publicationTitle":"2021 7th Annual International Conference on Network and Information Systems for Computers (ICNISC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 7th Annual International Conference on Network and Information Systems for Computers (ICNISC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9603279/9603803/09603866.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9603803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNISC54316.2021.00017","abstract":"In this paper,the logarithmic domain efficient decoding algorithm of LDPC code has been deeply studied,and the efficient algorithm with tree topology structure has been improved.

It is now possible to recognize images or even find objects inside an image with a standard GPU. Image processing is a recent science that aims to provide specialists from different areas, as to the general public, tools for manipulating these digital data from the real world. The detection of moving objects is a crucial step for systems based on image processing. The movements detected by the classic algorithms are not necessarily interesting for a thorough information search, and the need to distinguish the coherent movements of parasitic movements exists in most cases. In this paper we are going to use a simply webcam and YOLO algorithm for this implementation. The YOLOv3 (Version 3) model makes predictions with a single network evaluation, making this method extremely fast, running in real time with a capable GPU. From there we'll use OpenCV, Python, and deep learning to apply the YOLOv3 object to images and apply YOLOv3 to video streams.","doi":"10.1109/ICNISC54316.2021.00053","pdfPath":"/iel7/9603279/9603803/09603899.pdf","startPage":"250","endPage":"257","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 7th Annual International Conference on Network and Information Systems for Computers (ICNISC)","publicationTitle":"2021 7th Annual International Conference on Network and Information Systems for Computers (ICNISC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNISC54316.2021.00053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9603803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Detection and Object Detection: Yolo (You Only Look Once)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9603899/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Motion Detection and Object Detection: Yolo (You Only Look Once)","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2021","publicationDate":"July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9603899/","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Detection and Object Detection: Yolo (You Only Look Once)","confLoc":"Guiyang, China","sourcePdf":"023200a250.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030357S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9603279","isNumber":"9603803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9603279","xplore-issue":"9603803","articleId":"9603899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9603908,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Ye","affiliation":["Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Ye","id":"37089158158"},{"name":"Yanmei Wang","affiliation":["Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yanmei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089157290"},{"name":"Zhichun Jia","affiliation":["Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhichun","lastName":"Jia","id":"37089158702"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0232-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0233-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9603908","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Web services","Computational modeling","Time series analysis","Quality of service","Predictive models","Throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quality prediction","recurrent neural network","service recommendation","time characteristic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9603908","abstract":"For web services, QoS (Quality of Service, quality of service) is an important indicator for judging whether a web service is efficient.

However, it is difficult to acquire adequate machine fault data in industrial applications. Generally, data collected in the healthy condition are massive, but rare fault samples are available. To address the diagnostic problem with few fault data, this article proposes a method, namely, multilabel cycle translating adversarial network (MCTAN). The architecture can translate healthy vibration data into auxiliary fault data. Signal-to-signal translation enables auxiliary data to be acquired based on few fault data and adequate healthy data. Then, the auxiliary data are utilized to improve the performance of DL-based fault classification approaches. Experimental results and comparative analysis indicate the superiority and robustness of the proposed method for bearing and gear fault diagnosis on widely used XJTU-SY, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Jiangnan University (JNU), and Southeast University (SEU) datasets. Even if the ratio of healthy data to fault data ranges from 50:1 to 300:1, the proposed MCTAN succeeds in raising the diagnosis accuracy by up to 25.87% and outperforms other comparative methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9259274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2021.3123433","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/9259274/09604008.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2021.3123433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal-to-Signal Translation for Fault Diagnosis of Bearings and Gears With Few Fault Samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Signal-to-Signal Translation for Fault Diagnosis of Bearings and Gears With Few Fault Samples","volume":"70","htmlLink":"/document/9604008/","isJournal":true,"externalId":"3526910","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9604008/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFE0208400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010880","fundingName":"Science and Technology Project of State Grid Corporation of China (Key Technologies of Novel Integrated Energy System Considering Cross-Border Interconnection)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal-to-Signal Translation for Fault Diagnosis of Bearings and Gears With Few Fault Samples","sourcePdf":"tim-tang-3123433-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079584S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9604008","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9604017,"authors":[{"name":"Ilham A.

The classification result could be used by the school to predict which pupils should be motivated to improve their self-control to avoid smartphone addiction. The study is carried out by creating and verifying the questionnaire, collecting the dataset, and categorizing the smartphone addiction based on the self-control. The findings of data collection yielded 168 participants who filled out the questionnaires that were distributed. These participants' responses were then collated and utilized as a dataset. The SAS response scores were then totaled and classified into low, medium, and high criteria. In this investigation, this criterion is chosen as the target class.

The TIA consists of a common-gate amplifier, a wideband Cherry-Hooper amplifier, and buffers. The common-gate amplifier uses a self-biased inverter to expand the bandwidth. The output transistors in the Cherry-Hooper amplifier are tunable to combat the process variation. The output buffer employs a small load resistor to guarantee wideband and sets switches to cut off the parasitic from the test buffer. Implemented in the 0.35 \u03bcm CMOS process, the TIA shows a simulated gain of 131 dB\u03a9, a bandwidth of 146 MHz, and an input-referred current noise of 16.3 pA/\u221aHz. The proposed TIA works well with the resonator, and oscillation builds up within 50 \u03bcs with a swing of 2.9 Vp-p. The simulated phase noise is -108.6 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset and -112.4 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz. The power consumption is 15 mW under 3.3 V supply.

Although the simulation results are given, it is the first time to drive 149 MHz resonators with motional resistance of up to 20 k\u03a9 by using an on-chip circuit. The proposed TIA mainly consists of a regulated-cascode (RGC) amplifier, an inverter-based Cherry-Hooper amplifier, and two buffers. The highlight of the TIA is the resistance-capacitance network, which provides a stable input bias for the Cherry-Hooper amplifier and introduces a leading phase to compensate for the excessive lagging phase of the TIA at 149 MHz. Implemented in the 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS process, the TIA occupies a silicon area of 90 \u03bcm*40 \u03bcm.

Fully Convolutional Network for Realtime Multi-scale Object Detection Algorithm","abstract":"Although great progress has been made in object detection, especially face detection, in recent years, one of the remaining difficult problems is maintaining excellent performance while detecting in real-time. To address this problem, we propose an effective single-stage object detector named Look Once Rapid Object Detector (LOROD), which uses fully convolutional layers. In particular, our framework is consists of two major modules. One is the Residual Convolutional Layer (RCL) module, which uses ResBlocks to achieve rapid convergence. The other module, namely the Multiple Scale & Dense Connection Convolutional Layers (MS-DCCL) module, is designed to enrich the feature maps and adapt to different scales. In addition, we propose some date augment strategies to increase the model\u2019s robustness. When running on GTX1080Ti, given images with a resolution of 352\u00d7352, the average time consumed for inference is merely 15.1 ms and the accuracy can reach 0.946 on the FDDB dataset. By comparing with the advanced algorithms, our method\u2019s effectiveness is proved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9604437/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9604437/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2021","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"LOROD: Fully Convolutional Network for Realtime Multi-scale Object Detection Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LOROD: Fully Convolutional Network for Realtime Multi-scale Object Detection Algorithm","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"123600a579.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118606S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9604213","isNumber":"9604215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9604213","xplore-issue":"9604215","articleId":"9604437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9604606,"authors":[{"name":"Umit Ilhan","affiliation":["Near East University Trnc, Mersin, Turkey"],"firstName":"Umit","lastName":"Ilhan","id":"37086356093"},{"name":"Ahmet Ilhan","affiliation":["Near East University Trnc, Mersin, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"Ilhan","id":"37087124016"},{"name":"Kaan Uyar","affiliation":["Near East University Trnc, Mersin, Turkey"],"firstName":"Kaan","lastName":"Uyar","id":"37086356666"},{"name":"Erkut Inan Iseri","affiliation":["Near East University Trnc, Mersin, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erkut Inan","lastName":"Iseri","id":"37086354478"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4930-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4931-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9604606","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Sensitivity","Neural networks","Asia","Nonhomogeneous media","Testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rice","Osmancik","Cammeo","Classification","Deep Neural Networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9604606","abstract":"Rice is one of the most widely consumed grains in the world.

However, current MRIs are acquired at clinical resolutions due to the limit of physical, technological, and economic considerations. On the other hand, existing approaches require paired MRI images as training data, which are difficult to obtain on existing datasets when the alignment between high and low-resolution images has to be implemented manually.Within the scope of project, we aim to provide an end-to-end system to solve the super-resolution method on 3D MRI. Our proposed method derives from recent neural network developments and does not require paired data for efficient training. By integrating different models with separated functions, our 3D super-resolution CycleGAN (SRCycleGAN) achieved compelling results on MRI volumes. The output is close with ground-truth, showing a low distortion on different scaling factors.

Three basic architectural schemes: wide range voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), single sideband (SSB) mixing, and multiple VCOs can be used to extend the frequency ranges. This article compares these schemes through quantitative evaluation to select the best synthesizer architecture to use according to the application specs. The chosen scheme is an optimized combination of a single VCO and a single SSB mixer. Using a quadrature VCO (QVCO) with a switched capacitor (SC) bank, the synthesizer provides a wide frequency band of operation ranging from 100 MHz to 9 GHz covering several avionic communication applications and several existing wireless standards\u2019 frequency requirements. The proposed QVCO is able to generate in-phase and quadrature-phase signals spread into a frequency band between 6 and 9 GHz providing a tuning range of 40% at a center frequency of 7.5 GHz. The QVCO exhibits a phase noise of \u2212107 dBc/Hz, at a 1-MHz offset frequency, while generating a 8-GHz carrier frequency. Its power consumption is of 3.4 mW. With a loop bandwidth of 120 kHz, the frequency synthesizer generates a phase noise, measured at 8 GHz, of \u2212106.4 dBc/Hz at a 1-MHz frequency offset. The overall power consumption of the synthesizer to generate a 140-MHz carrier frequency is 26.57 mW from a 1.2-V supply.

This paper explores the validity and viability of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) -and more specifically LSTMs- as potential enablers for realizing such predictions. To this end, a novel QoS prediction mechanism is presented that uses an LSTM architecture and network-related QoS metrics, in order to identify specific patterns and predict in advance the QoS that will be available in the near future to a Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV).

The rate encoded computation in SNNs utilizes the number of spikes in a time window to encode the intensity of a signal, in a similar way to the information encoding in stochastic computing. Inspired by this similarity, this paper presents a hardware design of stochastic SNNs that attains a high accuracy. A design framework is elaborated for the input, hidden and output layers. This design takes advantage of a priority encoder to convert the spikes between layers of neurons into index-based signals and uses the cumulative distribution function of the signals for spike train generation. Thus, it mitigates the problem of a relatively low information density and reduces the usage of hardware resources in SNNs. This design is implemented in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and its performance is evaluated on the MNIST image recognition dataset. Hardware costs are evaluated for different sizes of hidden layers in the stochastic SNNs and the recognition accuracy is obtained using different lengths of stochastic sequences. The results show that this stochastic SNN framework achieves a higher accuracy compared to other SNN designs and a comparable accuracy as their ANN counterparts. Hence, the proposed SNN design can be an effective alternative to achieving high accuracy in hardware constrained applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9604778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SiPS52927.2021.00050","doi":"10.1109/SiPS52927.2021.00050","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","pdfPath":"/iel7/9604907/9604778/09604982.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9604982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9604982/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Highly Accurate Stochastic Spiking Neural Network","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9604982/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of a Highly Accurate Stochastic Spiking Neural Network","confLoc":"Coimbra, Portugal","sourcePdf":"014400a241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08059S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9604907","isNumber":"9604778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9604907","xplore-issue":"9604778","articleId":"9604982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9605006,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Mohsin Abbas","affiliation":["McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Syed Mohsin","lastName":"Abbas","id":"37085401983"},{"name":"Marwan Jalaleddine","affiliation":["McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Marwan","lastName":"Jalaleddine","id":"37088934083"},{"name":"Warren J.

Irrespective of the structure of the error correcting code, GRAND tries to guess the noise that corrupted the codeword in order to decode any linear error-correcting block code. GRAND Markov Order (GRAND-MO) is a variant of GRAND that is useful to decode error correcting code transmitted over communication channels with memory which are vulnerable to burst noise. Usually, interleavers and de-interleavers are used in communication systems to mitigate the effects of channel memory. Interleaving and de-interleaving introduce undesirable latency, which increases with channel memory. To prevent this added latency penalty, GRAND-MO can be directly used on the hard demodulated channel signals. This work reports the first GRAND-MO hardware architecture which achieves an average throughput of up to 52 Gbps and 64 Gbps for a code length of 128 and 79 respectively.

The experimental results show that in the separation task with reverberation, the proposed way has better performance on scale-invariant signal-to-noise ratio (SI-SNR) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) than DPRNN and filter-and-sum network (FasNet) which is currently the most state-of-the-art temporal neural beamformer.","doi":"10.1109/SiPS52927.2021.00042","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9604907/9604778/09605016.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9604778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SiPS52927.2021.00042","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","startPage":"194","endPage":"198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DFBNet: Deep Neural Network based Fixed Beamformer for Multi-channel Speech Separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9605016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"DFBNet: Deep Neural Network based Fixed Beamformer for Multi-channel Speech Separation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605016/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9605016/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DFBNet: Deep Neural Network based Fixed Beamformer for Multi-channel Speech Separation","confLoc":"Coimbra, Portugal","sourcePdf":"014400a194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133968S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9604907","isNumber":"9604778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9604907","xplore-issue":"9604778","articleId":"9605016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":9605021,"authors":[{"name":"Sifan Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China","Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sifan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089030228"},{"name":"Jianhua Geng","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China","Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Geng","id":"37089030129"},{"name":"Xin Lou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Lou","id":"38571946500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0144-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0145-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-7390"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1520-6130"}],"articleNumber":"9605021","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-frequency analysis","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Convolution","Simulation","Pipelines","Estimation","Training data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival (DOA)","acoustic vector sensor (AVS)","fully convolutional network (FCN)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9605021","abstract":"In this paper, a learning-based direction of arrival (DOA) estimation pipeline for acoustic vector sensor (AVS) is proposed.

Unlike conventional direct path dominant (DPD) or single source points (SSP) detection, the uncontaminated TF point extraction problem is modeled as an image segmentation problem, where the direct DOA cues from the spatial response of AVS is utilized for ground truth labeling to generate the training data of the network. With the extracted uncontaminated TF points, the final DOA can be generated using the proposed fuzzy geometric median (FGM) clustering.

Compared with conventional convolution, the deformable convolution has an irregular receptive field to adapt to objects with different sizes and shapes. However, the irregularity of the receptive field causes inefficient access to memory and increases the complexity of control logic. Toward hardware-friendly implementation, prior works change the characteristics of deformable convolution by restricting the receptive field, leading to accuracy degradation. In this paper, we develop a dedicated Sampling Core to sample and rearrange the input pixels, enabling the convolution array to access the inputs regularly. In addition, a memory-efficient dataflow is introduced to match the processing speed of the Sampling Core and convolutional array, which improves hardware utilization and reduces access to off-chip memory. Based on these optimizations, we propose a novel hardware architecture for the deformable convolution network, which is the first work to accelerate the original deformable convolution network. With the design of the memory-efficient architecture, the access to the off-chip memory is reduced significantly. We implement it on Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA, and experiments show that the energy efficiency reaches 50.29 GOPS/W, which is 2.5 times higher compared with executing the same network on GPU.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Shape","Memory architecture","Graphics processing units","Random access memory","Hardware","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"Author

Neural Synaptic Plasticity-Based Stochastic Deep Neural Network Computing","abstract":"With the increasing popularity of deep neural networks (DNNs), a large amount of research effort has been devoted to the hardware acceleration of DNNs to achieve efficient processing. Nevertheless, few works have explored the similarities between the biological essence of DNNs and arithmetic circuits. Moreover, stochastic computing (SC), which implements complex arithmetic operations with simple logic gates, has been applied to the acceleration of DNNs. However, traditional SC suffers from high latency and large hardware cost of pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). Inspired by neural synaptic plasticity and SC, in this work, we present the reconfigurable neural synaptic plasticity-based computing (RNSP) to mimic the biological neuron behaviors and exploit the parallelism of SC to the full extent while maintaining a small hardware footprint compared to fixed-point counterparts. RNSP converts fixed-point numbers to parallel bits without logic resources, which are then synthesized by bit-wise multiplications and some full adders. In addition, we propose the arithmetic unit based on RNSP and use re-training to mitigate the accuracy degradation. Finally, a convolution engine (CE) built on RNSP with high memory bandwidth efficiency is designed. According to the implementation results on FPGA, the proposed RNSP-based CE outperforms the fixed-point counterpart in terms of power consumption and area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605066/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9605066/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Neural Synaptic Plasticity-Based Stochastic Deep Neural Network Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable Neural Synaptic Plasticity-Based Stochastic Deep Neural Network Computing","confLoc":"Coimbra, Portugal","sourcePdf":"014400a229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062979S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9604907","isNumber":"9604778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9604907","xplore-issue":"9604778","articleId":"9605066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9605067,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Dai","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Dai","id":"37088929189"},{"name":"Harrison Liew","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Harrison","lastName":"Liew","id":"37088432393"},{"name":"Maryam Eslami Rasekh","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Maryam Eslami","lastName":"Rasekh","id":"37404033900"},{"name":"Seyed Hadi Mirfarshbafan","affiliation":["ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Seyed Hadi","lastName":"Mirfarshbafan","id":"37086960376"},{"name":"Alexandra Gallyas-Sanhueza","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Alexandra","lastName":"Gallyas-Sanhueza","id":"37086955677"},{"name":"James Dunn","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Dunn","id":"37087212019"},{"name":"Upamanyu Madhow","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Upamanyu","lastName":"Madhow","id":"37274246600"},{"name":"Christoph Studer","affiliation":["ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Studer","id":"38575411500"},{"name":"Borivoje Nikoli\u0107","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Borivoje","lastName":"Nikoli\u0107","id":"37268296200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0144-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0145-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-7390"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1520-6130"}],"articleNumber":"9605067","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":27},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9605067","abstract":"This paper describes a scalable, highly portable, and energy-efficient generator for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) baseband processing systems.

Indeed, this standard opens the door to a new generation of standards aiming at a convergence of networks and communication protocols (Wi-fi, LTE, 4G, etc.). These results in the need for flexible implementations of different families of codes as for instance, Turbo, LPDC and Polar codes.In this context, the work presented in this article proposes to design such flexible ASIP (application-specific instruction set processor) in an IoT context. The approach discussed is supported by experimental results obtained on the basis of a RISC-V architecture to which specific instruction sets have been added. Results demonstrate a reduction of the required processing clock cycles up to 47.7%, 29.8%, 16.5% and 9.7% for Polar, LDPC, NB-LDPC and Turbo (LTE) codes, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/5GWF52925.2021.00046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5GWF52925.2021.00046","startPage":"224","endPage":"229","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th 5G World Forum (5GWF)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9604908/9604780/09605070.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th 5G World Forum (5GWF)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9604780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended RISC-V hardware architecture for future digital communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Extended RISC-V hardware architecture for future digital communication systems","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2021","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9605070/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605070/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended RISC-V hardware architecture for future digital communication systems","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"430800a224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100917S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9604908","isNumber":"9604780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9604908","xplore-issue":"9604780","articleId":"9605070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9605140,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Yang","affiliation":["College of Mechanical Engineering, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085966916"},{"name":"Shuyuan Yu","affiliation":["College of Mechanical Engineering, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Shuyuan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37089028441"},{"name":"Xionghou Yu","affiliation":["College of Mechanical Engineering, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Xionghou","lastName":"Yu","id":"37089027647"},{"name":"Junming Huang","affiliation":["College of Mechanical Engineering, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Junming","lastName":"Huang","id":"37089027406"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3849-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3848-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3850-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9605140","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image recognition","Machine learning algorithms","Clouds","Machine learning","Light emitting diodes","Safety","Robots"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Jetson Nano","deep learning","weather recognition","capsule network","smart fog lamp","assisted driving"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9605140","abstract":"In order to improve the driving safety of vehicles in foggy environment, a set of intelligent control system for vehicle fog lamp that can automatically control the fog lamp on and off by identifying the weather conditions is designed.

On the basis of ensuring path safety, the GMPP uses the shortest path length as the objective function. Secondly, the GMPP considers the task execution problem of multi-robot path planning to avoid collisions in a shared working environment. As a result, the GMPP introduces a central planner to make collision-free driving between multiple robots through two mechanisms: collision detection and collision elimination. Comparison experiments between the GMPP and other swarm optimization algorithms are carried out. The results show that the GMPP has better overall performance in terms of anti-collision safety and efficiency for multi-robot path planning.","doi":"10.1109/ICACR53472.2021.9605194","startPage":"140","endPage":"144","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 5th International Conference on Automation, Control and Robots (ICACR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9605143/9605137/09605194.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 5th International Conference on Automation, Control and Robots (ICACR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACR53472.2021.9605194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9605137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research and Implementation of Multi-robot Path Planning Based on Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Genetics","Path planning","Safety","Collision avoidance","Task analysis","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm","multi-robot path planning","central planner","collision detection","collision elimination"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Research and Implementation of Multi-robot Path Planning Based on Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9605194/","publicationDate":"25 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research and Implementation of Multi-robot Path Planning Based on Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Nanning, China","sourcePdf":"ICACR2021-ART_032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063281S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9605143","isNumber":"9605137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9605143","xplore-issue":"9605137","articleId":"9605194","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9605260,"authors":[{"name":"Meidong Kuang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnial University, Beilin, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Meidong","lastName":"Kuang","orcid":"0000-0002-9755-2383"},{"name":"Jian Xie","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnial University, Beilin, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Xie","orcid":"0000-0001-9654-064X"},{"name":"Ling Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnial University, Beilin, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Yuexian Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnial University, Beilin, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Yuexian","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-3622-6162"},{"name":"Yanyun Gong","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnial University, Beilin, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Yanyun","lastName":"Gong"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9605260","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Location awareness","Minimization","Computational complexity","Arrays","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Near-filed localization","FOC","l\u2080-norm","low-complexity","and sparse parameter estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9605260","abstract":"The \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$l_{1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-norm-based sparse signal reconstruction has relatively satisfactory performance for near-field parameter estimation.

In particular, O-OFDMNet employs deep neural networks (DNNs) for converting a complex-valued signal into a non-negative signal in the time-domain at the transmitter and vice versa at the receiver. The associated frequency-domain signal processing remains the same as in conventional radio frequency (RF) OFDM. As a result, our scheme achieves the same spectral efficiency as the RF scheme, which has never been attained by the existing O-OFDM schemes, because they have relied on the Hermitian symmetry of the spectral-domain signal to guarantee that the time-domain signal becomes real-valued. We show that O-OFDMNet can be viewed as an autoencoder architecture, which can be trained in an end-to-end manner in order to simultaneously improve both the bit error ratio (BER) and the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) for transmission over both additive white Gaussian noise and frequency-selective channels. Furthermore, we intrinsically integrate a soft-decision aided channel decoder with our O-OFDMNet and investigate its coded performance relying on both convolutional and polar codes. The simulation results show that our scheme improves both the uncoded and coded BER as well as a reducing the PAPR compared to the benchmarks at the cost of a moderate additional DNN complexity. Furthermore, our scheme is capable of approaching the throughput of RF-OFDM, which is notably higher than that of conventional O-OFDM. Finally, our complexity analysis shows that O-OFDMNet is suitable for real-time operation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9605573/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","volume":"40","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning-Aided Optical IM/DD OFDM Approaches the Throughput of RF-OFDM","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (COALESCE)","grantNumber":"EP/P034284/1, EP/P003990/1 and EP/S002871/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council\u2019s Advanced Fellow Grant QuantCom","grantNumber":"789028"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning-Aided Optical IM/DD OFDM Approaches the Throughput of RF-OFDM","sourcePdf":"jsac-luong-3126080-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096287S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"9653871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","xplore-issue":"9653871","articleId":"9605573","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9605575,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Wang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-9539-9194"},{"name":"Chen Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0002-9532-7721"},{"name":"Zheng Shi","affiliation":["School of Intelligent Systems Science and Engineering, Jinan University, Zhuhai, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Shi","orcid":"0000-0003-3531-9217"},{"name":"Yaru Fu","affiliation":["School of Science and Technology, The Open University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yaru","lastName":"Fu","orcid":"0000-0002-6139-7414"},{"name":"Rongfang Song","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Rongfang","lastName":"Song","orcid":"0000-0002-8170-3618"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9605575","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Uplink","Transceivers","Optimization","Equalizers","Covariance matrices","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RIS","NOMA","phase shift","GSIC","uplink"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9605575","abstract":"The combination of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is capable of boosting spectrum and energy efficiency for future communication networks. In this letter, we aim to minimize the total transmit power for uplink multi-group RIS-aided NOMA system via jointly designing the transceivers and phase shifts. Particularly, a novel framework with group-based successive interference cancellation (GSIC) is conceived, wherein the user groups associated with different RISs are served by NOMA and the GSIC is invoked to separate user signals in different groups. Furthermore, to facilitate the process, the original optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems, i.e., transceiver design and phase shift optimization. In the transceiver design, a parallel iteration algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal transmit power when the minimum mean square error receiver is employed. For the optimization of phase shifts, a sequential rotation scheme is proposed to properly devise each phase shifter. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms various benchmarks in terms of total transmit power.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3125689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3125689","startPage":"187","endPage":"191","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09605575.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GSIC for RIS-Aided Uplink Multi-Antenna NOMA Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"GSIC for RIS-Aided Uplink Multi-Antenna NOMA Systems","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9605575/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605575/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771257, 62171237 and 61801246"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"BX20180143 and 2019M660126"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GSIC for RIS-Aided Uplink Multi-Antenna NOMA Systems","sourcePdf":"lcomm-wang-3125689-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062718S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9674048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9674048","articleId":"9605575","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9605578,"authors":[{"name":"Jingke Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9605578/xu-3125056-small.gif","p":["Jingke Xu received the B.S. degree in information and computational science from Shandong Agricultural University, Tai\u2019an, China, in 2014, and the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2019.

The nature of sporadic activity in mMTC provides a solution to enhance spectrum efficiency by employing compressive sensing (CS) to perform multiuser detection (MUD). However, CS-MUD suffers from high computation complexity and fails to meet the strict latency requirement in some critical applications. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel deep learning (DL) based framework for grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA), where we utilize the information distilled from the initial data recovery phase to further enhance channel estimation, which in turn improves data recovery performance. Besides, we design an interpretable and structured Model-driven Prior Information Aided Network (M-PIAN) and provide theoretical analysis that demonstrates the proposed M-PIAN can converge faster and support more users. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing CS algorithms and DL methods in both computation complexity and reconstruction accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605579/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9605579/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prior Information Aided Deep Learning Method for Grant-Free NOMA in mMTC","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Key- Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2019B010157002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62122012, 61911530216, 6196113039 and U1834210"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005023","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety","grantNumber":"RCS2021ZZ004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2020JBZD005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"L202019"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society Newton Advanced Fellowship","grantNumber":"NA191006"},{"fundingName":"Project of China Shenhua","grantNumber":"GJNY-20-01-1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prior Information Aided Deep Learning Method for Grant-Free NOMA in mMTC","sourcePdf":"jsac-chen-3126071-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143421S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"9653871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","xplore-issue":"9653871","articleId":"9605579","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9605580,"authors":[{"name":"Yibo Wu","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Gothenburg, Sweden","Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Yibo Wu (Student Member, IEEE) received the bachelor\u2019s degree in communication engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2017, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2019, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical Engineering.

While deep learning can solve complex problems, digital signal processing (DSP) is interpretable and can be more computationally efficient. To combine both, we propose the dual path network (DPN). It consists of a signal path of DSP operations that recover the signal, and a feature path of neural networks that estimate the unknown transmit parameters. By interconnecting the paths over several recovery stages, later stages benefit from the recovered signals and reuse all the previously extracted features. The proposed design is demonstrated to provide 5% improvement in modulation classification compared to alternative designs lacking either feature sharing or access to recovered signals. The estimation results of DPN along with its blind decoding performance are shown to outperform a blind signal processing algorithm for BPSK and QPSK on a simulated dataset. An over-the-air software-defined-radio capture was used to verify DPN results at high SNRs. DPN design can process variable length inputs and is shown to outperform relying on fixed length inputs with prediction averaging on longer signals by up to 15% in modulation classification.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Decoding","Neural networks","Deep learning","Signal processing","Receivers","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind symbol decoding","deep learning","automatic modulation classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2021.3126088","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/9653871/09605585.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"96","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2021.3126088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Processing-Based Deep Learning for Blind Symbol Decoding and Modulation Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9605585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Signal Processing-Based Deep Learning for Blind Symbol Decoding and Modulation Classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605585/","volume":"40","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9605585/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"CONIX Research Center, one of six centers in JUMP, a Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) program sponsored by DARPA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Processing-Based Deep Learning for Blind Symbol Decoding and Modulation Classification","sourcePdf":"jsac-hanna-3126088-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123324S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"9653871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","xplore-issue":"9653871","articleId":"9605585","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9605607,"authors":[{"name":"Niranjana Radhakrishnan","affiliation":["School of Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9605607/radha-3125725-small.gif","p":["Niranjana Radhakrishnan received the B.Tech. degree (Hons.) in electronics and communication engineering from the University of Calicut, in 2014, and the M.Tech. degree in electronic systems engineering from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, in 2017.

Among various prediction techniques, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a deep learning model that has demonstrated high performance in forecasting spectrum characteristics. Although well-performing, the theoretical characterization of LSTM prediction performance has not been well developed in the literature. Therefore, in this article, we examine an LSTM based temporal spectrum prediction model and characterize its prediction performance through theoretical analysis. To this end, we analyze the LSTM prediction outputs over simulated Markov-model-based spectrum data and spectrum measurements data. Our results suggest that the predicted scores of the LSTM based system model can be described using mixtures of truncated Gaussian distributions. We also estimate the performance metrics using the mixture model and compare the results with the observed prediction performance over simulated and measured datasets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605607/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9605607/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Long Short-Term Memory-Based Markovian Spectrum Prediction","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"RMIT Research Stipend Scholarship (RRSS-SC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Performance Analysis of Long Short-Term Memory-Based Markovian Spectrum Prediction","sourcePdf":"access-radhakrishnan-3125725-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097972S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9605607","onlineDate":"08 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9605611,"authors":[{"name":"Van-Tinh Nguyen","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Ikoma, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9605611/nguye-3125685-small.gif","p":["Van-Tinh Nguyen (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.E. degree from the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics, Minsk, Belarus, in 2012.

We propose residual BSNN learning using a surrogate gradient that shortens the time steps in the BSNN while maintaining sufficient accuracy. At the circuit level, presynaptic spikes are fed to memory units through differential bit lines (BLs), while binarized weights are stored in a subarray of nonvolatile STT-MRAM. When the common inputs are fed through BLs, vector-to-matrix multiplication can be performed in a single memory sensing phase, hence achieving massive parallelism with low power and low latency. We further introduce the concept of a dynamic threshold to reduce the implementation complexity of synapses and neuron circuitry. This adjustable threshold also permits a nonlinear batch normalization (BN) function to be incorporated into the integrate-and-fire (IF) neuron circuit. The circuitry greatly improves the overall performance and enables high regularity in circuit layouts. Our proposed netlist circuits are built on a 65-nm CMOS with a fitted magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) model for performance evaluation. The hardware/software co-simulation results indicate that the proposed design can deliver a performance of 176.6 TOPS/W for an in-memory computing (IMC) subarray size of \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1\\times 288$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n.

In the composite case, where the hypotheses consist of sets of states, any such exponent is upper bounded by the infimum of the corresponding pairwise exponents of discriminating individual members of the two sets. Attainability of this upper bound may depend on the type of exponents considered; whether the problem is classical or quantum; the cardinality and the geometric properties of the sets representing the hypotheses; and also on the dimensionality of the underlying Hilbert space. Our main contribution is clarifying this landscape considerably. We show that in the quantum case unattainability is the general behaviour for all the exponents, already in finite dimension, for a simple null-hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis consisting of only two states. Moreover, the upper bound may be strict even in the infinite-dimensional classical case if the alternative hypothesis contains at least countably infinitely many states. We also prove general attainability results, e.g., for classical adversarial and arbitrarily varying hypothesis testing, and for the quantum case where all states are pure, or the states commute with every state in the opposite hypothesis.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3125683","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9687099/09605647.pdf","startPage":"1032","endPage":"1067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9687099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3125683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"On the Error Exponents of Binary State Discrimination With Composite Hypotheses","volume":"68","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/9605647/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"Feb. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605647/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011019","fundingName":"National Research, Development and Innovation Office of Hungary","grantNumber":"K124152, KH129601 and K132097"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Innovation and Technology and the National Research, Development and Innovation Office within the Quantum Information National Laboratory of Hungary"},{"fundingName":"Bolyai J\u00e1nos Fellowship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences"},{"fundingName":"\u00daNKP-19-4 New National Excellence Program of the Ministry for Innovation and Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Error Exponents of Binary State Discrimination With Composite Hypotheses","sourcePdf":"tit-weiner-3125683-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.22042S","chronDate":"Feb.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9687099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9687099","articleId":"9605647","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9605656,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o MP Cardoso","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal","Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science, Porto, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/9605655/9605656/cardo-3117316-small.gif","p":["Jo\u00e3o MP Cardoso (Senior Member, IEEE) received the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico (IST), the Technical University of Lisbon, in 2001.

To use the sound event classification model in the wild, it is needed to be independent of recording conditions. Therefore, a more generalized model, that can be trained and tested in various recording conditions, must be researched. This paper presents a deep neural network with a dual-path frequency residual network and feedback modules for sound event classification. Most deep neural network based approaches for sound event classification use feed-forward models and train with a single classification result. Although these methods are simple to implement and deliver reasonable results, the integration of recurrent inference based methods has shown potential for classification and generalization performance improvements. We propose a weighted recurrent inference based model by employing cascading feedback modules for sound event classification. In our experiments, it is shown that the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches in indoor and outdoor conditions by 1.94% and 3.26%, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605665/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9605665/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Feedback Module Based Convolution Neural Networks for Sound Event Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Korea Environment Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) through the Exotic Invasive Species Management Program funded by the Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE)","grantNumber":"2021002280004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Feedback Module Based Convolution Neural Networks for Sound Event Classification","sourcePdf":"access-ko-3126004-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095537S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9605665","onlineDate":"08 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":9605683,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanyuan Tang","affiliation":["University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yuanyuan Tang (Student Member, IEEE) received the bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering from the Department of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, in 2015, and the master\u2019s degree in engineering from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, in 2018.

However, the diversity of errors that occur in DNA sequences makes efficient error-correction a challenging task. This paper aims to address simultaneously correcting two types of errors, namely, short tandem duplication and edit errors, where an edit error may be a substitution, deletion, or insertion. We focus on tandem repeats of length at most 3 and design codes for correcting an arbitrary number of duplication errors and one edit error. Because an edited symbol can be duplicated many times (as part of substrings of various lengths), a single edit can affect an unbounded substring of the retrieved word. However, we show that with appropriate preprocessing, the effect may be limited to a substring of finite length, thus making efficient error-correction possible. We construct a code for correcting the aforementioned errors and provide lower bounds for its rate. Compared to optimal codes correcting only duplication errors, numerical results show that the asymptotic cost of protecting against an additional edit is only 0.003 bits/symbol when the alphabet has size 4, an important case corresponding to data storage in DNA.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3125724","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9687099/09605683.pdf","startPage":"871","endPage":"880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9687099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3125724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Error-Correcting Codes for Short Tandem Duplication and Edit Errors","volume":"68","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/9605683/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"Feb. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605683/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF Grants","grantNumber":"1816409 and 1755773"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-Correcting Codes for Short Tandem Duplication and Edit Errors","sourcePdf":"tit-tang-3125724-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120876S","chronDate":"Feb.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9687099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9687099","articleId":"9605683","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9605689,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmut Burak Karadeniz","affiliation":["Emerging Circuits and Computation Group, Istanbul Technical University, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9605689/karad-3125672-small.gif","p":["Mahmut Burak Karadeniz received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Turkish Naval Academy, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2011, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle, USA, in 2015.

STAMP exploits the stochastic nature of sampling error; its name is derived from \u2018stochastic\u2019 and \u2018sampling\u2019. A unique feature of STAMP which distinguishes it from other random generators is the ability to control the output probability of the generated stochastic bit stream in real-time with no area overhead.

Data-driven approaches typically applied to system specific sensor data provide a way to predict failures of aircraft systems. However, it is believed that some systems deteriorate faster when subjected to particular environmental conditions, such as humidity or dust. In this study, we consider an aircraft system which is suspected to experience degradation due to humidity during ground operations. We apply a Random Forest approach to sensor data only and a combination of sensor data and environmental data from airports to estimate the system\u2019s remaining useful life. To our knowledge this is the first paper addressing the problem of integrating environmental data in prognostics for aircraft systems using raw sensor data. The method is validated on a data set provided by an airline that includes the per-second sensor data of 11 different sensors for roughly 12,300 flights, as well as 15 removals. Meteorological data for airports worldwide is obtained from the Meteorological Aerodrome Reports database. The results show that incorporating environmental data in prognostics has a potential towards more accurate prediction models.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9605657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAMS48097.2021.9605715","publicationTitle":"2021 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9605695/9605657/09605715.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/RAMS48097.2021.9605715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Prognostics Incorporating Environmental Factors for Aircraft Maintenance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2021","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Prognostics Incorporating Environmental Factors for Aircraft Maintenance","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9605715/","publicationDate":"24 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605715/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Prognostics Incorporating Environmental Factors for Aircraft Maintenance","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"12C2-148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054875S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9605695","isNumber":"9605657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9605695","xplore-issue":"9605657","articleId":"9605715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9605720,"authors":[{"name":"Pooyan Mobtahej","affiliation":["Lamar University"],"bio":{"p":["Pooyan Mobtahej","Department of Industrial Engineering","Lamar University","4400 S M L King Jr Pkwy,","Beaumont, TX 77705 USA","e-mail: pmobtahej@lamar.edu","Pooyan is a Doctor of Industrial Engineering Student in Lamar university who had Engineering and Management background in Chalmers/Gothenburg University in Sweden.

Considering the installation cost of $1 to $2 million US dollars for a compressor, the failure of the component can be costly. Therefore, the anomaly detection for the compression system is essential. In this paper, a deep learning-based anomaly detection method is proposed to identify the failure of midstream compressors using audio sensor data. Firstly, short-term Fourier transform (STFT), Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), and spectral centroid (SC) features are computed using the input audio signals. Secondly, deep learning-based feature extraction is applied to create high-level features. Finally, a principal component analysis step and a support vector machine are applied to classify normal and anomaly audio signals.The proposed method was evaluated using two datasets with a total of 10196 audio signals collected from a compressor. The experimental results demonstrate that MFCC features are better than STFT features for anomaly detection and the combined deep MFCC features and SC features can achieve the best normal and anomaly signal classification performance, 100% for both datasets, using the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605720/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9605720/","publicationDate":"24 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2021","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning-based Anomaly Detection for Compressors Using Audio Data","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning-based Anomaly Detection for Compressors Using Audio Data","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01D2-056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05615S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9605695","isNumber":"9605657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9605695","xplore-issue":"9605657","articleId":"9605720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9605767,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Davila-Frias","affiliation":["North Dakota State University"],"bio":{"p":["Alex Davila-Frias","North Dakota State University Fargo, North Dakota, 58102 USA e-mail: alex.davilafrias@ndsu.edu","Alex Davila-Frias received the bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics in 2006 and the M.B.A. degree in 2014 from the Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Nacional, Quito, Ecuador.

Fast and accurate network reliability estimation can help to prevent mishaps. Exact all-terminal calculation is an NP-hard and computationally expensive problem, which has led to the development of approximate methods based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Although there have been some research studies on all-terminal reliability estimation using ANNs, there have not been yet many works that apply deep learning algorithms for all-terminal network reliability. This study presents a preliminary development of all-terminal network reliability estimation based on deep neural networks (DNNs), a state-of-the-art deep learning technique. To use DNNs for all-terminal network reliability estimation, an appropriate architecture of DNN needs to be developed. Different architectures are investigated by exploring parameters such as the number of hidden layers and the dropping probability parameter of a dropout layer to prevent overfitting. Hyperbolic tangent activation function limits the output to the range [0,1]. In addition, the network topology information needs to be preprocessed for the DNN to be able to process it and predict the network reliability. Graphs are used to represent the networks. Furthermore, to turn graphs into a computationally digestible format, advanced graph embedding methods (GEM) are employed. Different embedding methods and architectures are investigated together by training them with the network reliability as target. A dataset of 6000 Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graphs was generated to this end. The best input-architecture configuration is selected based on the root mean squared error (RMSE) using cross-validation. The best DNN proposed here, based on the RMSE (0.01), outperforms a previous traditional ANN approach. There is also a significant computation time reduction achieved by using the proposed DNN, which does not require the reliability upper bound as an additional input as employed in previous studies based on ANN.","doi":"10.1109/RAMS48097.2021.9605767","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9605695/9605657/09605767.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAMS48097.2021.9605767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9605657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Neural Networks for All-Terminal Network Reliability Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Upper bound","Computer network reliability","Estimation","Transportation","Random access memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Neural Networks","all-terminal network reliability","graph embedding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Neural Networks for All-Terminal Network Reliability Estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9605767/","publicationDate":"24 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2021","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Neural Networks for All-Terminal Network Reliability Estimation","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"06C3-128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104756S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9605695","isNumber":"9605657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9605695","xplore-issue":"9605657","articleId":"9605767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9605844,"authors":[{"name":"Egor Sedov","affiliation":["Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University, Birmingham, UK","Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russia"],"firstName":"Egor","lastName":"Sedov","id":"37087320534"},{"name":"Pedro J.

optical/ radio frequency (FSO/RF) links. Two destinations need assistance from relay associated with FSO link connecting a source node. The heterodyne detection or direct detection is necessary for detecting signal in the first hop. In the second hop, the relay relying on the non-orthogonal multiple access technique to support multiple users through an RF link. The high-speed backhauling related to FSO is suitable to design hybrid system for applications in high dense users environment. The FSO link is modeled by the M distribution in the presence of pointing errors, while the RF link is modeled by Rayleigh fading. To provide system performance analysis, we present closed-form formulas of the outage probability. Furthermore, we find that performance gap among two users mainly depend on power allocation factors and transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the source. Finally, we conduct Monte Carlo simulation results to corroborate the derived formulas.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","NOMA","Monte Carlo methods","System performance","Probability","Power system reliability","Resource management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["free space optical (FSO)","non-orthogonal multiple access","outage probability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIAfS52090.2021.9605853","publicationTitle":"2021 10th International Conference on Information and Automation for Sustainability (ICIAfS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 10th International Conference on Information and Automation for Sustainability (ICIAfS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9605696/9605803/09605853.pdf","startPage":"346","endPage":"351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9605803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIAfS52090.2021.9605853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Employing Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for A Dual-Hop Relaying System With FSO/RF Links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9605853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Employing Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for A Dual-Hop Relaying System With FSO/RF Links","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605853/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"11 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9605853/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Employing Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for A Dual-Hop Relaying System With FSO/RF Links","confLoc":"Negambo, Sri Lanka","sourcePdf":"p346-nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070827S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9605696","isNumber":"9605803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9605696","xplore-issue":"9605803","articleId":"9605853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9605870,"authors":[{"name":"Toshiaki Koike-Akino","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Toshiaki","lastName":"Koike-Akino","id":"38266933200"},{"name":"Ye Wang","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086515040"},{"name":"Keisuke Kojima","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Keisuke","lastName":"Kojima","id":"37089161312"},{"name":"Kieran Parsons","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Kieran","lastName":"Parsons","id":"37348910700"},{"name":"Tsuyoshi Yoshida","affiliation":["Information Technology R&D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsuyoshi","lastName":"Yoshida","id":"37089157819"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3868-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1150-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9605870","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9605870","abstract":"We propose a multiplier-less deep neural network (DNN) to mitigate fiber-nonlinear distortion of shaped constellations.

The near user (NU) harvest energy utilizing PS protocol, whereas the far user (FU) utilized the TS protocol for energy harvesting.

This incurs practical difficulty when a non-stationary user is communicating with the base station.

DR became one of the important cause of blindness and vision impairment worldwide. Usually, DR is diagnosed by examining the eyes through a fundus camera. Small lesions such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, hard exudates, etc., appear in the DR affected retina. DR grading is an important task to determine the type of treatment. Usually, lesions in the DR images are hard to detect and classify as they are smaller in size and have similar visual appearance. Most of the automated approaches for DR grading make use of the information from both eyes to determine the DR grade of a particular eye. These information fusion approaches vary from simple concatenation of the features of both retinal images (left and right eyes) to complex higher-order pooling mechanisms such as Bilinear pooling. As they are evaluated on different datasets it is hard to determine which approach is better for this purpose. In this work, we investigate different deep learning-based information fusion strategies to integrate the features from both eyes of a patient to find the DR grading of a particular eye. We found that a simple approach which concatenates the average-pooled features from both eyes to capture the overall information about the patient, with the features extracted from the eye under consideration performs equally well compared to bilinear pooling based approach, but with low memory and computational requirements. In addition, this approach gives considerable improvements in accuracy and Kappa scores compared to the widely used approach which just concatenates the features from both eyes to determine the DR grading of a particular eye. Our approach gives a Kappa score of 0.849 with ResNet-18 as the backbone architecture on the test set of Kaggle-EyePACS dataset, which is competitive to the state-of-the-art.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9605991/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9605991/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"11 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Look at Both Eyes: Deep Learning Based Feature Fusion Strategies for the Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy Lesions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Look at Both Eyes: Deep Learning Based Feature Fusion Strategies for the Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy Lesions","confLoc":"Negambo, Sri Lanka","sourcePdf":"p263-nirthika.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084309S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9605696","isNumber":"9605803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9605696","xplore-issue":"9605803","articleId":"9605991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9606010,"authors":[{"name":"Bohan Sang","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Bohan","lastName":"Sang","id":"37088842679"},{"name":"Jiao Zhang","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jiao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089161394"},{"name":"Chen Wang","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089158967"},{"name":"Miao Kong","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Kong","id":"37086078979"},{"name":"Yuxuan Tan","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yuxuan","lastName":"Tan","id":"37089159100"},{"name":"Li Zhao","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37089156051"},{"name":"Wen Zhou","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37089159287"},{"name":"Dongdong Shang","affiliation":["Huawei Technol.

In this paper, the possibility of using data from an accelerometer attached to the abdomen of the mother to detect fetal movements using recurrent neural networks in realtime is analyzed. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers were incorporated into the network to ensure that useful features are remembered over multiple data points. Data preprocessing was carried out to ensure proper training of the network. Acceptable results were obtained and the network was trained well with the given data set. Initially, the raw accelerometer readings were used as the input to the LSTM network and since the raw data did not yield good results, the LSTM network was modified to use spectrogram of the accelerometer data as the input which made a dramatic improvement on the results obtained. The neural networks implemented in this paper had fewer layers mainly due to the absence of enough data because a huge amount of data is needed for a deep network. Furthermore, with a larger data set, a deeper network can be trained which will yield more reliable results which would ultimately give an algorithm that can detect fetal movement accurately. This paper hence demonstrates the fact that the use of recurrent neural networks to identify fetal movement is possible and can yield satisfactory results.","doi":"10.1109/ICIAfS52090.2021.9606131","startPage":"464","endPage":"469","publicationTitle":"2021 10th International Conference on Information and Automation for Sustainability (ICIAfS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIAfS52090.2021.9606131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9605803","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 10th International Conference on Information and Automation for Sustainability (ICIAfS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9605696/9605803/09606131.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fetal Movement Detection using Long Short-Term Memory Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606131/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fetal Movement Detection using Long Short-Term Memory Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9606131/","publicationDate":"11 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fetal Movement Detection using Long Short-Term Memory Network","confLoc":"Negambo, Sri Lanka","sourcePdf":"p464-somathilake.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069752S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9605696","isNumber":"9605803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9605696","xplore-issue":"9605803","articleId":"9606131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9606133,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In a log sequence, adjacent logs have the property of local correlation, while long-distance logs have remote dependencies. It is helpful to fully mine these information during modeling for improving the performance of anomaly detection. Meanwhile, there are some redundant information or noise in the log sequence, which has no contribution to the detection, and may even bring negative impact. The existing methods for log sequence anomaly detection do not take the above problems into account when constructing models. In this paper, we propose LSADNET, an unsupervised log sequence anomaly detection network based on local information extraction and globally sparse Transformer model. LSADNET applies multi-layer convolution to capture the local correlation between adjacent logs, and utilizes Transformer to learn the global dependency among long-distance logs. Meanwhile, we propose a globally sparse Transformer model to improve the self-attention mechanism, which can help to retain important information adaptively and eliminate the irrelevant information in the log sequence. In addition, according to the co-occurrence mode of log templates, we put forward the calculation formula of log template transfer value, and apply it to log vectorization. Through sufficient experiments on two public datasets, it is confirmed that LSADNET has better performance than the state-of-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2021.3125967","startPage":"4119","endPage":"4133","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/4275028/9644641/09606230.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2021.3125967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Log Sequence Anomaly Detection Based on Local Information Extraction and Globally Sparse Transformer Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Anomaly detection","Transformers","Task analysis","Information retrieval","Correlation","Principal component analysis","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Log parsing","anomaly detection","local information extraction","globally sparse transformer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606230/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Log Sequence Anomaly Detection Based on Local Information Extraction and Globally Sparse Transformer Model","volume":"18","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/9606230/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China and Shenzhen Research Council","grantNumber":"2020A1515010970, JCYJ20200109113427092 and GJHZ20180928155209705"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Log Sequence Anomaly Detection Based on Local Information Extraction and Globally Sparse Transformer Model","sourcePdf":"tnsm-zhang-3125967-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09936S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"9644641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","xplore-issue":"9644641","articleId":"9606230","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9606334,"authors":[{"name":"Venceslav Kafedziski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies, University Ss Cyril and Methodius, Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia"],"firstName":"Venceslav","lastName":"Kafedziski","id":"37326524800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4442-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4443-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9606334","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9606334","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Landmine detection","Image coding","Ground penetrating radar","Estimation","Radar imaging","Radar antennas","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ground penetrating radar","Stepped frequency radar","Compressive sampling","Probabilistic model","Markov chain","Markov random field","Land mine detection"]}],"abstract":"We investigate a compressive sampling (CS) stepped frequency ground penetrating radar for detection of underground objects, which uses Bayesian estimation and a probabilistic model for the target support. Due to the underground targets being sparse, the B-scan is a sparse image. Using the CS principle, the stepped frequency radar is implemented using a subset of random frequencies at each antenna position. For image reconstruction we use Markov Chain and Markov Random Field models for the target support in the B-scan, where we also estimate the model parameters using the Expectation Maximization algorithm. The approach is tested using Web radar data obtained by measuring the signal responses scattered off land mine targets in a laboratory experimental setup. Our approach results in improved performance compared to the standard denoising algorithm for image reconstruction.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9606243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TELSIKS52058.2021.9606334","publicationTitle":"2021 15th International Conference on Advanced Technologies, Systems and Services in Telecommunications (TELSIKS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 15th International Conference on Advanced Technologies, Systems and Services in Telecommunications (TELSIKS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9605802/9606243/09606334.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"144","doi":"10.1109/TELSIKS52058.2021.9606334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Sampling Stepped Frequency GPR Using Probabilistic Structured Sparsity Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Sampling Stepped Frequency GPR Using Probabilistic Structured Sparsity Models","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9606334/","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606334/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Sampling Stepped Frequency GPR Using Probabilistic Structured Sparsity Models","confLoc":"Nis, Serbia","sourcePdf":"46-TELSIKS-21-088-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051636S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9605802","isNumber":"9606243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9605802","xplore-issue":"9606243","articleId":"9606334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9606444,"authors":[{"name":"Kirill Andreev","affiliation":["Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Kirill","lastName":"Andreev","id":"37087013807"},{"name":"Alexey Frolov","affiliation":["Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Alexey","lastName":"Frolov","id":"37086569828"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3308-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3309-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2694-5215"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2377-6781"}],"articleNumber":"9606444","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading channels","Base stations","Transmitters","Spectral efficiency","Wireless networks","Redundancy","Receiving antennas"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9606444","doi":"10.1109/REDUNDANCY52534.2021.9606444","publicationTitle":"2021 XVII International Symposium \"Problems of Redundancy in Information and Control Systems\" (REDUNDANCY)","abstract":"In this paper, we consider massive machine-type communications (mMTC), a crucial communication scenario for future 5G/6G wireless networks. Indeed, the number of devices connected to the network grows exponentially. At the same time, the traffic of the devices is significantly different from the traffic generated by human users and consists of short and sporadically sent packets. The main goal is not to increase spectral efficiency but to provide connectivity and energy efficiency. Current transmission schemes are highly inefficient in this regime. The most promising way to deal with the problem is to use the random-access schemes or, equivalently, a grant-free transmission, i.e., the device transmits the packet without any prior communication to the base station. As the number of devices is extreme, creating different encoders for the users is impossible, and the promising strategy is to employ the same encoder for all the users. In this case, the receiver can not identify the source of the message, and, thus, such schemes are called unsourced random access (URA) schemes. To increase the battery life, the transmitters in the mMTC scenario must be as simple as possible. At the same time, the restrictions for the receiver (base station) are not so strict, and one can equip the receiver with multiple antennas. In this talk, we focus on this scenario. The existing papers on this topic consider either a single receive antenna case or a massive (with 100-800 antennas) MIMO receivers. In this talk, we focus on moderate (8) antenna count. That is more realistic for long-range narrowband transmissions. We evaluate different methods for the Rayleigh fading channel and the MIMO-enabled base station. We start our analysis with a coded compressed-sensing-based approach for different types of outer code. Next, we investigate a covariance-based method, which performs well in a massive MIMO scenario. Finally, we evaluate the TIN-SIC approach, which shows good performance for a single-antenna case. We present our results as minimal energy per bit (E\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</inf>\n/N\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</inf>\n) required to achieve the target per-user probability of error (PUPE). The TIN-SIC scheme with blind detection shows a substantial increase in energy efficiency and active users number (14 dB and \u00d73 respectively for 8 antennas at the BS).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REDUNDANCY52534.2021.9606444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9606439","startPage":"17","endPage":"21","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 XVII International Symposium \"Problems of Redundancy in Information and Control Systems\" (REDUNDANCY)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9606438/9606439/09606444.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Unsourced Random Access for the MIMO Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9606444/","displayDocTitle":"On Unsourced Random Access for the MIMO Channel","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 2021","publicationDate":"25 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006769","fundingName":"Russian Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Unsourced Random Access for the MIMO Channel","confLoc":"Moscow, Russian Federation","sourcePdf":"1570757979.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082112S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9606438","isNumber":"9606439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9606438","xplore-issue":"9606439","articleId":"9606444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":9606516,"authors":[{"name":"Fahao Chen","affiliation":["University of Aizu, Aizuwakamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Fahao","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-4345-1296"},{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["University of Aizu, Aizuwakamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-4981-0496"},{"name":"Toshiaki Miyazaki","affiliation":["University of Aizu, Aizuwakamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshiaki","lastName":"Miyazaki","orcid":"0000-0002-7657-2924"},{"name":"Celimuge Wu","affiliation":["University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Japan"],"firstName":"Celimuge","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0001-6853-5878"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2183"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9883"}],"articleNumber":"9606516","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FedGraph: Federated Graph Learning With Intelligent Sampling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Convolution","Collaborative work","Servers","Privacy","Computational modeling","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Federated learning","graph learning","graph sampling","reinforcement learning"]}],"abstract":"Federated learning has attracted much research attention due to its privacy protection in distributed machine learning. However, existing work of federated learning mainly focuses on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which cannot efficiently handle graph data that are popular in many applications. Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has been proposed as one of the most promising techniques for graph learning, but its federated setting has been seldom explored. In this article, we propose FedGraph for federated graph learning among multiple computing clients, each of which holds a subgraph. FedGraph provides strong graph learning capability across clients by addressing two unique challenges. First, traditional GCN training needs feature data sharing among clients, leading to risk of privacy leakage. FedGraph solves this issue using a novel cross-client convolution operation. The second challenge is high GCN training overhead incurred by large graph size. We propose an intelligent graph sampling algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, which can automatically converge to the optimal sampling policies that balance training speed and accuracy. We implement FedGraph based on PyTorch and deploy it on a testbed for performance evaluation. The experimental results of four popular datasets demonstrate that FedGraph significantly outperforms existing work by enabling faster convergence to higher accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3125565","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9642402/09606516.pdf","startPage":"1775","endPage":"1786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9642402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3125565","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9606516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606516/","displayDocTitle":"FedGraph: Federated Graph Learning With Intelligent Sampling","volume":"33","issue":"8","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2022","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004399","fundingName":"Okawa Foundation for Information and Telecommunications"},{"fundingName":"G-7 Scholarship Foundation"},{"fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"21H03424 and 19K20258"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FedGraph: Federated Graph Learning With Intelligent Sampling","sourcePdf":"tpds-li-3125565-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077761S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2022","isNumber":"9642402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","articleId":"9606516","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":9606533,"authors":[{"name":"Magda Amiridi","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9606533/amiri-3125147-small.gif","p":["Magda Amiridi (Student Member, IEEE) received the Diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Technical University of Crete (TUC), Chania, Greece, in 2018.

However, such an approach typically requires knowledge of the multivariate probability distribution of all features and the target, and involves a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. Recent work has shown that any joint Probability Mass Function (PMF) can be represented as a naive Bayes model, via Canonical Polyadic (tensor rank) Decomposition. In this paper, we introduce a low-rank tensor model of the joint PMF of all variables and indirect targeting as a way of mitigating complexity and maximizing the classification performance for a given number of features. Through low-rank modeling of the joint PMF, it is possible to circumvent the curse of dimensionality by learning \u2018principal components\u2019 of the joint distribution. By indirectly aiming to predict the latent variable of the naive Bayes model instead of the original target variable, it is possible to formulate the feature selection problem as maximization of a monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint \u2013 which can be tackled using a greedy algorithm that comes with performance guarantees. Numerical experiments with several standard datasets suggest that the proposed approach compares favorably to the state-of-art for this important problem.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3125147","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09606533.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3125147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"6195","endPage":"6205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information-Theoretic Feature Selection via Tensor Decomposition and Submodularity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9606533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Information-Theoretic Feature Selection via Tensor Decomposition and Submodularity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606533/","volume":"69","htmlLink":"/document/9606533/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"IIS-1704074"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information-Theoretic Feature Selection via Tensor Decomposition and Submodularity","sourcePdf":"tsp-amiridi-3125147-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111822S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9606533","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":9606541,"authors":[{"name":"Fatemeh Mahdavi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, and Computer Engineering, Qom University of Technology (QUT), Qom, Iran"],"firstName":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Mahdavi","id":"37088699618"},{"name":"Hadi Zayyani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, and Computer Engineering, Qom University of Technology (QUT), Qom, Iran"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Zayyani","orcid":"0000-0001-6350-6541","id":"38346577100"},{"name":"Roozbeh Rajabi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, and Computer Engineering, Qom University of Technology (QUT), Qom, Iran"],"firstName":"Roozbeh","lastName":"Rajabi","orcid":"0000-0002-4098-4820","id":"37540738800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2475-1472"}],"articleNumber":"9606541","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"","file":"/ielx7/7782634/9622206/9606541/graphical_abstract/lsens-gagraphic-3125911.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/7782634/9622206/9606541/graphical_abstract/lsens-gagraphic-3125911.jpg"},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9606541","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Location awareness","Convolutional neural networks","Training","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless fidelity","Recurrent neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensor networks","deep neural network (DNN)","fusion","machine learning (ML)","received signal strength (RSS) localization","wireless sensor network (WSN)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LSENS.2021.3125911","pdfPath":"/iel7/7782634/9622206/09606541.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Letters","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9622206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSENS.2021.3125911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RSS Localization Using an Optimized Fusion of Two Deep Neural Networks","abstract":"The problem of received signal strength (RSS) source localization in wireless sensor networks has raised attention in recent years due to its low complexity.

So far, convolutional the neural network (CNN), the recurrent neural network (RNN), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are used to this end. In this letter, neural networks such as MLP, CNN, and RNN are suggested to be combined pairwise. In this regard, we propose to use a fusion of two general neural network localization estimators. To design the combination coefficients, a heuristic approach based on the errors of the training step of two neural networks are suggested. Moreover, two optimized approaches for selecting the combination coefficients are provided based on mean and variances and also based on the mean square error of the combined estimator.

Nevertheless, there are only landslide and unlabeled areas in the real world, and directly considering unlabeled areas as nonlandslide areas may cause bias and incorrect label assignment. In this article, we present a positive unlabeled learning method coupled with adaptive sampling and random forest (AdaPU-RF) to predict landslide susceptibility in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China. This method can make full use of the landslide and nonlandslide information contained in unlabeled areas. Experimental results show that the AdaPU-RF method achieves desirable predication outcomes in terms of accuracy analysis, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty analysis. Overall, the application of AdaPU-RF provides a new perspective for landslide susceptibility prediction, and can be recommended for other areas with similar geo-environmental conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Terrain factors","Rivers","Reservoirs","Geology","Indexes","Learning systems","Vegetation mapping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive sampling","landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP)","positive unlabeled (PU) learning","sensitivity analysis","uncertainty analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3125741","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/9314330/09606594.pdf","startPage":"11581","endPage":"11592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9314330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3125741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Landslide Susceptibility Prediction Based on Positive Unlabeled Learning Coupled With Adaptive Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9606594","topic":"Intelligent perception of geohazards","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Landslide Susceptibility Prediction Based on Positive Unlabeled Learning Coupled With Adaptive Sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606594/","volume":"14","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9606594/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271408 and 41602362"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011174","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004701","fundingName":"China University of Geosciences, Wuhan","grantNumber":"GBL12107"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for National Universities"},{"fundingName":"China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Landslide Susceptibility Prediction Based on Positive Unlabeled Learning Coupled With Adaptive Sampling","sourcePdf":"jstars-fang-3125741-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106789S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"9314330","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","xplore-issue":"9314330","topics":["Intelligent perception of geohazards"],"articleId":"9606594","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9606606,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhe Du","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9606606/du-3125607-small.gif","p":["Jianhe Du (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from Yunnan University, Yunnan, China, in 2007 and 2010, and the Ph.D. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2015.

At the base station (BS), the information symbols are encoded according to the Khatri-Rao space-time (KRST) method and transmitted through time-varying channels. The received signals at the mobile station (MS) are constructed into a nested complex-valued parallel factor (PARAFAC) model, which contains an outer model and an inner model, respectively. With outer model, we estimate the compound channel matrix and detect the information symbols considering the sparse scattering nature of mmWave channels. With inner model, we extract physical parameters, including angles of arrival/departure (AoAs/AoDs), Doppler shifts and complex path gains from the estimated compound channel matrix. These physical parameters can be used to significantly reduce feedback overhead. A tricky way here is that we convert complex inner-submodel into a real one such that the computational complexity is reduced. Compared with existing schemes, the proposed one improves the estimation accuracy with low computational complexity, and is applicable for both uniform linear arrays (ULAs) and uniform planar arrays (UPAs). Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint channel estimation and information symbol detection scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tensor-Based Joint Channel Estimation and Symbol Detection for Time-Varying mmWave Massive MIMO Systems","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3125607","endPage":"6266","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09606606.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"6251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3125607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9606606","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Tensors","Estimation","Massive MIMO","Time-varying systems","Encoding","Transmission line matrix methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tensor","joint estimation and detection","mmWave","massive MIMO","time-varying channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tensor-Based Joint Channel Estimation and Symbol Detection for Time-Varying mmWave Massive MIMO Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606606/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","volume":"69","htmlLink":"/document/9606606/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61831013, 61601414 and 62171416"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"CUC210B005"},{"fundingName":"Tsinghua University-China Mobile Communications Group Company Ltd.

We also apply the proposed fast algorithm to secure beamforming design for enhancing physical layer security in cognitive nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks, where secrecy rate optimization problems in both underlay and overly cognitive NOMA networks are typical fractional QCQPs and have not been well studied. Simulation results have shown that our proposed fast algorithm achieves almost the same performance as the state-of-the-art methods, however, the proposed fast algorithm has very low computation complexity.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3125139","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3125139","startPage":"6237","endPage":"6250","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09606617.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9606617","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606617/","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Algorithm for Fractional QCQP and Applications to Secure Beamforming in Cognitive Nonorthogonal Multiple Access Networks","volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9606617/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61802447"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2018B0303110016"},{"fundingName":"Hunan Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2019JJ40043"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Algorithm for Fractional QCQP and Applications to Secure Beamforming in Cognitive Nonorthogonal Multiple Access Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-li-3125139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135076S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9606617","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9606663,"authors":[{"name":"Menghui Niu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Vibration and Control of Aero-Propulsion Systems Ministry of Education of China, and the School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9259274/9606663/niu-3125987-small.gif","p":["Menghui Niu received the B.E. degree from the School of Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, China, in 2013, and the M.S. degree from the School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Northeastern University (NEU), Shenyang, China, in 2016, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include machine vision and image processing."]},"firstName":"Menghui","lastName":"Niu","orcid":"0000-0002-7850-815X","id":"37086376905"},{"name":"Yanyan Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Vibration and Control of Aero-Propulsion Systems Ministry of Education of China, and the School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9259274/9606663/ywang-3125987-small.gif","p":["Yanyan Wang received the B.S. degree in mechanical manufacturing and automation from the Qingdao University of Technology, Qingdao, China, in 2018, and the M.S. degree in mechanical design and theory from Northeastern University (NEU), Shenyang, China, in 2021, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering with the School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation.","Her current research interests include deep learning and intelligent inspection."]},"firstName":"Yanyan","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-5610-2864","id":"37088885449"},{"name":"Kechen Song","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Vibration and Control of Aero-Propulsion Systems Ministry of Education of China, and the School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9259274/9606663/song-3125987-small.gif","p":["Kechen Song (Member, IEEE) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Northeastern University (NEU), Shenyang, China, in 2009, 2011, and 2014, respectively.","From 2018 to 2019, he was an Academic Visitor with the Department of Computer Science, Loughborough University, Loughborough, U.K. He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, NEU.

The existing anomaly detection model is usually suitable for products with a simple or regular background texture. However, there is a lack of a universal surface defect anomaly detection framework for railway products when facing the challenges: the complex background texture, huge intraclass variation, uneven distribution of interclass, and weak texture-featured defects. To fill this gap, an innovative generative adversarial network based on adaptive pyramid graph (APG) and variation residuals (APGVR-GAN) is proposed, aiming to improve the robustness of anomaly detection in railway products and other complex industrial supplies. First, the APG module is embedded in the encoder\u2013decoder\u2013encoder pattern, capturing the correlation description between neighbor regions, which is utilized to enhance the detection of abnormal defects with weak texture. Next, the variation residual module is employed to enhance the expression of various normal samples in the latent space and improve the identification ability for abnormal samples. Then, the dual-probability prototype loss is proposed to make different normal samples have more concentrated expression and more similar probability distribution centers in latent space. Finally, an adaptive focal-gate loss and a regularized log-likelihood loss are designed to overcome the imbalance problem in training samples with different background information. The effectiveness of the model is verified on three new railway datasets and three other industrial public datasets. The results show that in anomaly detection, APGVR-GAN on the three railway datasets, Northeastern University (NEU)-the rail surface defects dataset (RSDD)-1 dataset, NEU-RSDD-1 dataset, and RSDD area under curve (AUC) [that is the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC)], can reach 0.89, 0.81, and 0.87, and its detection accuracy (ACC) reached 0.97, 0.96, and 0.92, which is much higher than other comparative anomaly detection algorithms. In the segmentation experiments on the RSDD dataset, compared with other known rail defect detection methods, the overall evaluation metric F-Score is 83.70 which is also better than other methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606663/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","isJournal":true,"externalId":"5020013","volume":"70","htmlLink":"/document/9606663/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Pyramid Graph and Variation Residual-Based Anomaly Detection Network for Rail Surface Defects","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51805078"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"N2103011 and N2003021"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Pyramid Graph and Variation Residual-Based Anomaly Detection Network for Rail Surface Defects","sourcePdf":"tim-song-3125987-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127865S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9606663","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9606665,"authors":[{"name":"Tahoura Mosavirik","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran","Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), Worcester, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9259274/9606665/mosav-3126011-small.gif","p":["Tahoura Mosavirik (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1993.

The ANN accurately extracts the dispersion model\u2019s parameters, and consequently, the MUT\u2019s complex permittivity profile.

Accurate fault location is extremely helpful in protecting PV plants, but existing research on locating DC series arc faults is limited. This paper proposes a novel DC series arc spatial location method. The proposed method estimates the distance based on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) emitted by the arc. The experimental system uses four antennas that form a tetrahedral topology to receive arc EMR signals. Some pretests are implemented before an arc occurs to obtain some known-location arc EMR signals, which are processed to be the candidate data of the arc EMR model. When the arc fault occurs, the candidate data are selected through comparison with the unknown-location signals. The arc EMR model is set up by the Bayesian regularized neural network (BRNN) algorithm. Then, the distances between the arc and antennas are estimated by the BRNN. The spatial coordinates are calculated with the antenna array topology and estimated distances. Finally, the verification results show that the algorithm has a 0.5 m average spatial location error, which is proven to be active and feasible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606670/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/9606670/","publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Spatial Location Method for DC Series Arc Faults Based on RSSI and Bayesian Regularization Neural Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51607055 and 51907047"},{"fundingName":"Public Projects of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"GG20E070008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Spatial Location Method for DC Series Arc Faults Based on RSSI and Bayesian Regularization Neural Network","sourcePdf":"jsen-you-3126058-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105952S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2021","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"9650682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","xplore-issue":"9650682","articleId":"9606670","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9606678,"authors":[{"name":"Chuang Chen","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9259274/9606678/chen-3126006-small.gif","p":["Chuang Chen received the M.Eng. degree in control engineering from Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, China, in 2018.

However, due to the epistemic uncertainties associated with aeroengine systems, prediction errors are unavoidable and sometimes significant in traditional deterministic point prediction methods. To improve the accuracy and credibility of RUL prediction, a novel prediction interval (PI) estimation method is proposed to quantify the uncertainties in RUL prediction. The proposed method involves data clustering, mathematical\u2013statistical analysis, and deep learning techniques and is achieved through off-line and online phases. In the off-line phase, an enhanced fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm is proposed to divide the aeroengine health status into several discrete states. After labeling the health state of each sampling point, PIs are computed for them. This step is achieved by the empirical distributions of errors associated with all instances belonging to the health state under consideration. In the online phase, a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network is employed to estimate the boundaries of point prediction, and thus, the PI of aeroengine RUL is generated. The aeroengine degradation dataset from NASA is used to validate the proposed RUL PI estimation method. The results obtained indicate that the proposed method is a promising tool for providing reliable aeroengine RUL interval estimates, which can inform maintenance-related decisions.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2021.3126006","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/9259274/09606678.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2021.3126006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9259274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction Interval Estimation of Aeroengine Remaining Useful Life Based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Prediction Interval Estimation of Aeroengine Remaining Useful Life Based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network","volume":"70","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2021","publicationDate":"2021","externalId":"3527213","htmlLink":"/document/9606678/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61873122, 61973288 and 62020106003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"202006830060"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011402","fundingName":"Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Mechanics and Control of Mechanical Structures, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics","grantNumber":"MCMS-I-0521G02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction Interval Estimation of Aeroengine Remaining Useful Life Based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network","sourcePdf":"tim-lu-3126006-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110415S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9606678","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9606685,"authors":[{"name":"Vlad Niculescu","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Laboratory, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/9647029/9606685/nicul-3126259-small.gif","p":["Vlad Niculescu received the master\u2019s degree in robotics, systems, and control from ETH Z\u00fcrich in 2019, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering with the Integrated Systems Laboratory.

Due to advances in technology, such samples of point processes are increasingly encountered. A key object of interest is the local intensity function. It has a straightforward interpretation that allows to understand and explore point process data. We consider functional approaches for point processes, where one has a sample of repeated realizations of the point process. This situation is inherently connected with Cox processes, where the intensity functions of the replications are modeled as random functions. Here we study a situation where one records covariates for each replication of the process, such as the daily temperature for bike rentals. For modeling point processes as responses with vector covariates as predictors we propose a novel regression approach for the intensity function that is intrinsically nonparametric. While the intensity function of a point process that is only observed once on a fixed domain cannot be identified, we show how covariates and repeated observations of the process can be utilized to make consistent estimation possible, and we also derive asymptotic rates of convergence without invoking parametric assumptions.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3126466","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9687099/09606719.pdf","startPage":"1133","endPage":"1156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9687099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3126466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Cox Point Process Regression","volume":"68","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/9606719/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"Feb. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606719/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"DMS-2014626"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cox Point Process Regression","sourcePdf":"tit-gajardocataldo-3126466-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155757S","chronDate":"Feb.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9687099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9687099","articleId":"9606719","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9606727,"authors":[{"name":"Hideaki Hayashi","affiliation":["Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9606727/hayas-3126348-small.gif","p":["Hideaki Hayashi (Member, IEEE) received the B.E., M.Eng., and D.Eng., degrees from Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan, in 2012, 2014, and 2016, respectively.

Existing EMG classification methods, which do not consider EMG features that have distribution with skewness and kurtosis, have limitations such as the requirement to tune hyperparameters.

The Johnson system is a normalizing translation that transforms non-normal distribution data into normal distribution data, thereby enabling the representation of a wide range of distributions. In this study, a discriminative model based on the multivariate Johnson \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$S_{\\mathrm {U}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n translation system is transformed into a linear combination of coefficients and input vectors using log-linearization; then, it is incorporated into a neural network structure. This allows the calculation of the posterior probability of each class given the input vectors and the determination of model parameters as weight coefficients of the network. The uniqueness of convergence of the network learning is theoretically guaranteed. In the experiments, the suitability of the proposed network for distributions including skewness and kurtosis was evaluated using artificially generated data. Its applicability to real biological data was also evaluated via EMG classification experiments. The results showed that the proposed network achieved high classification performance (e.g., 99.973% accuracy using Khushaba\u2019s dataset) without the need for hyperparameter optimization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606727/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9606727/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network Based on the Johnson <i>S</i><sub>U</sub> Translation System and Related Application to Electromyogram Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI","grantNumber":"JP17K12752 and JP21H03511"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002241","fundingName":"Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) ACT-I","grantNumber":"JPMJPR18UO"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Neural Network Based on the Johnson <italic>S</italic><sub>U</sub> Translation System and Related Application to Electromyogram Classification","sourcePdf":"access-hayashi-3126348-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104289S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9606727","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9606732,"authors":[{"name":"Toyohiro Tsurumaru","affiliation":["Information Technology Research and Development Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Kamakura-shi, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Toyohiro Tsurumaru was born in Japan, in 1973.

There are many studies of this problem since Klapper and Goresky first introduced an adaptive rational approximation algorithm with a time complexity of \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(n^{2}\\log n\\log \\log n)$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n. In this paper, we revisit this problem by considering both adaptive and non-adaptive efficient algorithms. Compared with the state-of-art methods, we make several contributions to the problem of finding MRFR. Firstly, we find a general and precise recursive relationship between the minimal bases for two adjacent lattices generated by successive truncation sequences. This enables us to improve the currently fastest adaptive algorithm proposed by Li \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">et al.</i>\n.

For this purpose, a standard method is to set an action penalty in the reward to find the optimal motion considering the energy expenditure. This method is widely used for the simplicity of implementation. However, since the reward is a linear sum, if the penalty is too large, the system will fall into local minima and no moving solution can be obtained. In contrast, if the penalty is too small, the effect may not be sufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the amount of the penalty so that the agent always moves dynamically, and the energy-saving effect is sufficient. Nevertheless, since adjusting the hyperparameters is computationally expensive, we need a learning method that is robust to the penalty setting problem. We investigated on the Spiking Neural Network (SNN), which has been attracting attention for its computational efficiency and neuromorphic architecture. We conducted gait experiments using a hexapod agent while varying the energy penalty settings in the simulation environment. By applying SNN to the conventional state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, we examined whether the agent could explore for an optimal gait with a larger penalty variation and obtain an energy-efficient gait verified with Cost of Transport (CoT), a metric of energy efficiency for gait. Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)+SNN resulted in a CoT of 1.64, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3)+SNN resulted in a CoT of 2.21, and Deep Deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)+SNN resulted in a CoT of 2.08 (1.91 for normal SAC, 2.38 for TD3, and 2.40 for DDPG). DRL combined with SNN succeeded in learning more energy efficient gait with lower CoT.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126311","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09606760.pdf","startPage":"150345","endPage":"150354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126311","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9606760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606760/","displayDocTitle":"Spiking Neural Network Discovers Energy-Efficient Hexapod Motion in Deep Reinforcement Learning","volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9606760/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas Hyper-Adaptability Project","grantNumber":"20H05458"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Spiking Neural Network Discovers Energy-Efficient Hexapod Motion in Deep Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"access-hayashibe-3126311-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084966S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9606760","onlineDate":"09 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":9606761,"authors":[{"name":"Huiping Liang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9259274/9606761/liang-3126390-small.gif","p":["Huiping Liang received the B.A. degree in automation from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 2020, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering.","His research interests include process monitoring, process control, and transfer learning."]},"firstName":"Huiping","lastName":"Liang","orcid":"0000-0002-8725-6273","id":"37089156989"},{"name":"Chunhua Yang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9259274/9606761/yang-3126390-small.gif","p":["Chunhua Yang (Senior Member, IEEE) received the M.S. degree in automatic control engineering and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 1988 and 2002, respectively.","Since 1999, she has been a Full Professor with the School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University.

The stable and safe operation of the roasting process is significant to guarantee the quality of output zinc and reduce industrial pollution and energy consumption. In order to realize safe and stable operation for the roasting process, it is particularly important to monitor the roasting process accurately. However, the first principles model of the roasting process is complex with coupled physical and chemical reactions, and the normal operating conditions may transfer to abnormal conditions such as over-decomposition, under-oxidation, and fluidized bed deposition, due to fluctuation of raw material composition. On the other hand, the data-driven process monitoring method will suffer from unbalanced data volume between different operating conditions, especially for the abnormal conditions, of which data are always insufficient. In order to address these problems and achieve accurate process monitoring for the zinc smelting roasting process, this article proposed a hybrid first principles and data-driven process monitoring method. In detail, an integrated principal component analysis and common subspace learning (PCA-CSL) method is first proposed to address the problem that different operating condition always has large divergence and imbalanced data volume. Here, the PCA algorithm is established for the operating conditions with sufficient data. On the contrary, for the operating condition with insufficient data, a CSL algorithm is proposed, which uses the operating condition with sufficient data to assist modeling for the operating condition with insufficient data in a common subspace, so as to realize accurate fault detection. Finally, an operating condition decision rule library is established based on integrated first principles and data-driven approach, and the parameters of decision rule were optimized according to particle swarm optimization (PSO) method to realize rule-based reasoning (RBR) based abnormal condition diagnosis. Extensive experiments are implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9259274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2021.3126390","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/9259274/09606761.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2021.3126390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid First Principles and Data-Driven Process Monitoring Method for Zinc Smelting Roasting Process","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid First Principles and Data-Driven Process Monitoring Method for Zinc Smelting Roasting Process","volume":"70","htmlLink":"/document/9606761/","isJournal":true,"externalId":"3527314","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606761/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62073340"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004735","fundingName":"Excellent Youth Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province","grantNumber":"2019JJ30032"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2019YFB1705300"},{"fundingName":"Major Key Project of PCL","grantNumber":"PCL 2021A09"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002822","fundingName":"Innovation Driven Plan in Central South University, China","grantNumber":"2019CX020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid First Principles and Data-Driven Process Monitoring Method for Zinc Smelting Roasting Process","sourcePdf":"tim-huang-3126390-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128928S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9606761","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9606763,"authors":[{"name":"Namrata Vaswani","affiliation":["Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Namrata Vaswani (Fellow, IEEE) received the B.Tech. degree from IIT-Delhi, India, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2004.

Using this approach, we show that in large lattice and stochastic geometric networks, when anchors are uniformly distributed, the average localization error of agents grows logarithmically with the reciprocal of anchor density in an asymptotic regime.

However, existing unfolding-based MIMO detectors have difficulties adapting to the high discrepancy in channel and noise conditions. In this study, we present a novel unfolding-based framework for MIMO detectors, which can automatically determine internal parameters of an unfolding-based MIMO detector to adapt to the varying conditions. A key part of our approach is to develop a hypernetwork that can effectively learn to generate the internal parameters in the sophisticated expectation propagation-based MIMO detector. In particular, we design long short-term memory-based hypernetwork to ensure the flexibility of the layers of the unfolded algorithm. The proposed framework is also extended to a coded MIMO turbo receiver to adapt to the different feedback beliefs from the decoder. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MIMO detectors have excellent adaptation capability to different channel environments and noise levels. Compared with the existing unfolded algorithm that is an optimal reference, the proposed framework avoids frequent retraining and presents the nearly optimal performance in uncoded and coded MIMO systems. An over-the-air platform is presented as well to demonstrate the significant robustness of the proposed receivers in practical deployment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606847/","volume":"40","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9606847/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive MIMO Detector Based on Hypernetwork: Design, Simulation, and Experimental Test","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFA0701602"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61941104"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 109-2218-E-110-006 and MOST 108-2628-E-110-001-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive MIMO Detector Based on Hypernetwork: Design, Simulation, and Experimental Test","sourcePdf":"jsac-jin-3126064-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159969S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"9653871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","xplore-issue":"9653871","articleId":"9606847","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9606860,"authors":[{"name":"Lucian Ionel G\u0103in\u0103","affiliation":["Politehnica University of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Lucian Ionel","lastName":"G\u0103in\u0103","id":"37087079648"},{"name":"Bianca Gu\u015fi\u0163\u0103","affiliation":["Politehnica University of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Bianca","lastName":"Gu\u015fi\u0163\u0103","id":"37087081409"},{"name":"Daniela St\u0103nescu","affiliation":["Politehnica University of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Daniela","lastName":"St\u0103nescu","id":"37583301700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1496-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3055-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2372-1618"}],"articleNumber":"9606860","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Steganography","Art","Process control","Control systems","Convolutional neural networks","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["steganography","image processing","KarhunenLo\u00e8ve transform","Convolutional Neural Networks","artificial intelligence","information security","image colorizing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9606860","abstract":"Steganography is the art and science of hiding secret messages without being discovered by a potential attacker.

As DNNs can have complex architectures with millions of trainable parameters (the so-called weights), their design and training are difficult even for highly qualified experts. In order to reduce human effort, neural architecture search (NAS) methods have been developed to automate the entire design process. The NAS methods typically combine searching in the space of candidate architectures and optimizing (learning) the weights using a gradient method. In this paper, we survey the key elements of NAS methods that \u2013 to various extents \u2013 consider hardware implementation of the resulting DNNs. We classified these methods into three major classes: single-objective NAS (no hardware is considered), hardware-aware NAS (DNN is optimized for a particular hardware platform), and NAS with hardware co-optimization (hardware is directly co-optimized with DNN as a part of NAS). Compared to previous surveys, we emphasize the multi-objective design approach that must be adopted in NAS and focus on co-design algorithms developed for concurrent optimization of DNN architectures and hardware platforms. As most research in this area deals with NAS for image classification using convolutional neural networks, we follow this trajectory in our paper. After reading the paper, the reader should understand why and how NAS and hardware co-optimization are currently used to build cutting-edge implementations of DNNs.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126685","startPage":"151337","endPage":"151362","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09606893.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Architecture Search and Hardware Accelerator Co-Search: A Survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Neural Architecture Search and Hardware Accelerator Co-Search: A Survey","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2021","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9606893/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606893/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001824","fundingName":"Czech Science Foundation Project","grantNumber":"21-13001S"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Neural Architecture Search and Hardware Accelerator Co-Search: A Survey","sourcePdf":"access-sekanina-3126685-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.328411S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9606893","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9606923,"authors":[{"name":"Claude Carlet","affiliation":["University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway","LAGA Laboratory, University of Paris 8, Saint-Denis, France"],"bio":{"p":["Claude Carlet received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Paris 6, Paris, France, in 1990, and the Habilitation to Direct theses from the University of Amiens, France, in 1994.

Functions with fast and easy to compute output are known which have good algebraic immunity, such as majority functions and the so-called hidden weight bit (HWB) functions, but they all have the same cryptographic weakness: their too small nonlinearity.

We study their Walsh transform and their nonlinearity and algebraic immunity. We observe with computer investigations that this generalization of the HWB function allows to keep its quality of being fast to compute and having good enough algebraic immunity, while significantly improving its nonlinearity. The functions already obtained in the investigations provide a quite good (and never reached before) trade-off between speed and security. Further (probably difficult) work should allow obtaining, among such generalized HWB functions whose number is huge, still better filter functions to be used in stream ciphers.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3126684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3126684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9687099","startPage":"1355","endPage":"1368","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9687099/09606923.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9606923","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boolean functions","Ciphers","Transforms","Hamming weight","Artificial intelligence","Table lookup","Resilience"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boolean function","cryptography","hidden weight bit function","nonlinearity","algebraic immunity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Wide Class of Boolean Functions Generalizing the Hidden Weight Bit Function","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"68","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9606923/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606923/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100016190","fundingName":"Trond Mohn stiftelse"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wide Class of Boolean Functions Generalizing the Hidden Weight Bit Function","sourcePdf":"tit-carlet-3126684-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102817S","chronDate":"Feb.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9687099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9687099","articleId":"9606923","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9606937,"authors":[{"name":"Colin Schmidt","affiliation":["University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9664397/9606937/schmi-3118046-small.gif","p":["Colin Schmidt received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering and computer science from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, in 2013.

This is evident from a look at the Three-Independent-Gate Field-Effect Transistor (TIGFET), a device renown for its ability for polarity reconfiguration. At the same time, its demonstrated dynamic control of the subthreshold slope beyond the thermal limit has only been studied at the device-level. This latter benefit is referred to as Super-Steep Subthreshold Slope (S4) operation and can lead to unprecedented gain, which is ideal for use in an amplifier circuit. In this paper, we investigate the impact of S4 operations when designing differential-amplifier circuits when using TIGFET technology. We demonstrate the benefits of our implementation both from a theoretical standpoint and through circuit-level analyses. More specifically, we show that the TIGFET -based amplifier gain is 95.5 $\\times$ better, and that the gain-bandwidth product is improved by 13.8, compared to an equivalent MOSFET-based design at the 90 nm node. Besides, we show that at equivalent gains, the TIGFET-based amplifier decreases the area and power by 22.8 $\\times$ and 7.2, respectively, against its MOSFET counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/VLSI-SoC53125.2021.9606989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-SoC53125.2021.9606989","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IFIP/IEEE 29th International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9606964/9606965/09606989.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IFIP/IEEE 29th International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9606965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel High-Gain Amplifier Circuit Using Super-Steep-Subthreshold-Slope Field-Effect Transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Novel High-Gain Amplifier Circuit Using Super-Steep-Subthreshold-Slope Field-Effect Transistors","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2021","publicationDate":"4 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9606989/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606989/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel High-Gain Amplifier Circuit Using Super-Steep-Subthreshold-Slope Field-Effect Transistors","confLoc":"Singapore, Singapore","sourcePdf":"10_paper_24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065394S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9606964","isNumber":"9606965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9606964","xplore-issue":"9606965","articleId":"9606989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-28"},{"_id":9606991,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoyang Cao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","Institute of Microelectronic, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore","ERIAN, Interdisciplinary Graduate Programme, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zhaoyang","lastName":"Cao","id":"37089035827"},{"name":"Tan-Tan Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronic, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tan-Tan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088524953"},{"name":"Yuan Gao","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronic, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37537325800"},{"name":"Wang Ling Goh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wang Ling","lastName":"Goh","id":"37282097000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2614-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2615-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8440"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2324-8432"}],"articleNumber":"9606991","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"abstract":"Inverter-based low-noise amplifier (LNA) offers an elegant solution in terms of power and area efficiency, which is favorable for ultrasound receivers. Nevertheless, it imposes challenges on circuit designs regarding the biasing circuit, the limited gain, robustness over process, supply voltage and temperature (PVT) variations. This paper presents an in-depth study of various inverter-based LNAs for ultrasound receiver design. In addition, three fully differential inverter-based LNAs are designed and optimized with minimum power and area penalty in the common-mode feedback (CMFB) circuit. The LNAs are implemented in a standard 0.18 - $\\mu m$ CMOS process, with the identical power consumption, simulation results show that LNA with single CMFB achieves lower distortion, i.e. a third harmonic distortion (HD3) of $\\lt -51.5$ dB with 35 mVp-p input, LNA with dual CMFB obtains better noise performance, i.e. $4.85 nV / \\sqrt{Hz}$ at 3 MHz.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","Ultrasonic imaging","Simulation","Receivers","Voltage","Very large scale integration","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultrasound","inverter-based amplifier","low-noise amplifier (LNA)","common-mode feedback (CMFB)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VLSI-SoC53125.2021.9606991","publicationTitle":"2021 IFIP/IEEE 29th International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IFIP/IEEE 29th International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9606964/9606965/09606991.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9606965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-SoC53125.2021.9606991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Fully Differential Energy-Efficient Inverter-Based Low-Noise Amplifier for Ultrasound Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9606991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of Fully Differential Energy-Efficient Inverter-Based Low-Noise Amplifier for Ultrasound Imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9606991/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"4 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9606991/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Fully Differential Energy-Efficient Inverter-Based Low-Noise Amplifier for Ultrasound Imaging","confLoc":"Singapore, Singapore","sourcePdf":"27_paper_67.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052356S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9606964","isNumber":"9606965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9606964","xplore-issue":"9606965","articleId":"9606991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-28"},{"_id":9607107,"authors":[{"name":"Jyoti Deshwal Yadav","affiliation":["Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, NOIDA, India"],"firstName":"Jyoti Deshwal","lastName":"Yadav","id":"37089156025"},{"name":"Vivek K.

The demand for such services has increased even more in current pandemic conditions, so it is important to maintain certain level of Quality of Service for live streaming video. This article aims at pre-processing live streaming video-traffic packets for Deep Learning application of classification of different quality mode (Resolution and framerate) based only on statistical properties of network traffic Internet Protocol (IP) packets flow. The traffic intensity is used as a main traffic type descriptor with some additional transforms. The article presents some of classification accuracy analysis depending on multiple factors, such as: type of traffic pre-processing, length of traffic window, traffic intensity sampling time. The results show that there is a set of such parameters that leads to the best classification accuracy. This way, it may be possible for content operators (platforms) to provide differentiated services for their users. According to testing results, for Deep Learning application the direct traffic intensity samples allows achieving good accuracy of 94% and higher without any additional transforms. This, of course, depends on the classifier model parameters, and article provides insight into them as well.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Analytical models","Transforms","Streaming media","Feature extraction","Data models","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Features Extraction","Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Networks","Network Traffic","Multi-class Classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MTTW53539.2021.9607153","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques in Wireless Communications (MTTW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques in Wireless Communications (MTTW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9607030/9606855/09607153.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9606855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MTTW53539.2021.9607153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Features Extraction for Live Streaming Video Classification with Deep and Convolutional Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9607153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Features Extraction for Live Streaming Video Classification with Deep and Convolutional Neural Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9607153/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"7 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9607153/","conferenceDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Features Extraction for Live Streaming Video Classification with Deep and Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Riga, Latvia","sourcePdf":"p058-grabs.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100566S","chronDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9607030","isNumber":"9606855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9607030","xplore-issue":"9606855","articleId":"9607153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-28"},{"_id":9607269,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Diagnosis is complicated by a high discordance rate among pathologists when distinguishing between melanoma and benign melanocytic lesions. A tool that allows pathology labs to sort and prioritize melanoma cases in their workflow could improve turnaround time by prioritizing challenging cases and routing them directly to the appropriate sub-specialist. We present a pathology deep learning system (PDLS) that performs hierarchical classification of digitized whole slide image (WSI) specimens into six classes defined by their morphological characteristics, including classification of \"Melanocytic Suspect\" specimens likely representing melanoma or severe dysplastic nevi . We trained the system on 7,685 images from a single lab (the reference lab), including the the largest set of triple-concordant melanocytic specimens compiled to date, and tested the sys-tem on 5,099 images from two distinct validation labs. We achieved Area Underneath the ROC Curve (AUC) values of 0.93 classifying Melanocytic Suspect specimens on the reference lab, 0.95 on the first validation lab, and 0.82 on the second validation lab. We demonstrate that the PDLS is capable of automatically sorting and triaging skin specimens with high sensitivity to Melanocytic Suspect cases and that a pathologist would only need between 30% and 60% of the caseload to address all melanoma specimens.","doi":"10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00076","startPage":"629","endPage":"638","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9607383","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9607382/9607383/09607498.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Pathology Deep Learning System Capable of Triage of Melanoma Specimens Utilizing Dermatopathologist Consensus as Ground Truth <sup>*</sup>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9607498/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Pathology Deep Learning System Capable of Triage of Melanoma Specimens Utilizing Dermatopathologist Consensus as Ground Truth <sup>*</sup>","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9607498/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","conferenceDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Pathology Deep Learning System Capable of Triage of Melanoma Specimens Utilizing Dermatopathologist Consensus as Ground Truth <sup>*</sup>","confLoc":"Montreal, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"019100a629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141502S","chronDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9607382","isNumber":"9607383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9607382","xplore-issue":"9607383","articleId":"9607498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9607529,"authors":[{"name":"Niccol\u00f2 Marini","affiliation":["Institute of Information Systems, HES-SO (University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland)","University of Geneva"],"firstName":"Niccol\u00f2","lastName":"Marini","id":"37089160354"},{"name":"Manfredo Atzori","affiliation":["Institute of Information Systems, HES-SO (University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland)","University of Padua"],"firstName":"Manfredo","lastName":"Atzori","id":"38469496500"},{"name":"Sebastian Ot\u00e1lora","affiliation":["Institute of Information Systems, HES-SO (University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland)","Inselspital, Bern Hospital"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Ot\u00e1lora","id":"37086383321"},{"name":"Stephane Marchand-Maillet","affiliation":["University of Geneva"],"firstName":"Stephane","lastName":"Marchand-Maillet","id":"38272352300"},{"name":"Henning M\u00fcller","affiliation":["Institute of Information Systems, HES-SO (University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland)","Medical Faculty, University of Geneva"],"firstName":"Henning","lastName":"M\u00fcller","id":"37928622200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0191-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0192-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-9944"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2473-9936"}],"articleNumber":"9607529","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Image segmentation","Image color analysis","Histopathology","Conferences","Neural networks","Convolutional neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9607529","abstract":"Computational pathology is a domain that aims to develop algorithms to automatically analyze large digitized histopathology images, called whole slide images (WSI). WSIs are produced scanning thin tissue samples that are stained to make specific structures visible. They show stain colour heterogeneity due to different preparation and scanning settings applied across medical centers. Stain colour heterogeneity is a problem to train convolutional neural net-works (CNN), the state-of-the-art algorithms for most computational pathology tasks, since CNNs usually underperform when tested on images including different stain variations than those within data used to train the CNN. Despite several methods that were developed, stain colour heterogeneity is still an unsolved challenge that limits the development of CNNs that can generalize on data from several medical centers. This paper aims to present a novel method to train CNNs that better generalize on data including several colour variations. The method, called H&E-adversarial CNN, exploits H&E matrix information to learn stain-invariant features during the training. The method is evaluated on the classification of colon and prostate histopathology images, involving eleven heterogeneous datasets, and compared with five other techniques used to handle stain colour heterogeneity. H&E-adversarial CNNs show an improvement in performance compared to the other algorithms, demonstrating that it can help to better deal with stain colour heterogeneous images.","doi":"10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00073","pdfPath":"/iel7/9607382/9607383/09607529.pdf","startPage":"601","endPage":"610","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9607383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"H&E-adversarial network: a convolutional neural network to learn stain-invariant features through Hematoxylin & Eosin regression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9607529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"H&E-adversarial network: a convolutional neural network to learn stain-invariant features through Hematoxylin & Eosin regression","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9607529/","conferenceDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"H&E-adversarial network: a convolutional neural network to learn stain-invariant features through Hematoxylin & Eosin regression","confLoc":"Montreal, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"019100a601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112882S","chronDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9607382","isNumber":"9607383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9607382","xplore-issue":"9607383","articleId":"9607529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9607588,"authors":[{"name":"Kanjar De","affiliation":["Lule\u00e5 University of Technology, Lule\u00e5, Sweden","Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Gj\u00f8vik, Norway"],"firstName":"Kanjar","lastName":"De","id":"38546786600"},{"name":"Marius Pedersen","affiliation":["Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Gj\u00f8vik, Norway"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Pedersen","id":"38012312900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0191-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0192-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-9944"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2473-9936"}],"articleNumber":"9607588","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9607588","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Computer vision","Image color analysis","Perturbation methods","Tools","Distortion","Robustness"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00009","pdfPath":"/iel7/9607382/9607383/09607588.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)","startPage":"21","endPage":"30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9607383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Colour on Robustness of Deep Neural Networks","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks have become the most widely used tool for computer vision applications like image classification, segmentation, object localization, etc. Recent studies have shown that the quality of images has a significant impact on the performance of these deep neural networks. The accuracy of the computer vision tasks gets significantly influenced by the image quality due to the shift in the distribution of the images on which the networks are trained on. Although, the effects of perturbations like image noise, image blur, image contrast, compression artifacts, etc. on the performance of deep neural networks on image classification have been studied, the effects of colour and quality of colour in digital images have been a mostly unexplored direction.

The principle of these networks consists in projecting graph signals using the eigen-decomposition of their Laplacians, then achieving filtering in the spectral domain prior to back-project the resulting filtered signals onto the input graph domain. However, the success of these operations is highly dependent on the relevance of the used Laplacians which are mostly handcrafted and this makes GCNs clearly sub-optimal. In this paper, we introduce a novel spectral GCN that learns not only the usual convolutional parameters but also the Laplacian operators. The latter are designed \"end-to-end\" as a part of a recursive Chebyshev decomposition with the particularity of conveying both the differential and the non-differential properties of the learned representations \u2013 with increasing order and discrimination power \u2013 without overparametrizing the trained GCNs.

However, there was very rare previous research on the challenging text2sketch task. In this paper, we first construct a text2sketch image dataset by modifying the prevalent CUB dataset. Then a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based model is proposed by leveraging a Conditional Layer-Instance Normalization (CLIN) module, which can fuse the image features and sentence vector effectively and guide the sketch generation process.

Nonetheless, majority of prior algorithms assume static surveillance cameras that severely restricts the coverage of the system unless the number of cameras is exponentially increased, consequently increasing both the installation and the monitoring costs. In the current work we propose an anomaly detection system based on mobile surveillance cameras, i.e., moving robots which continuously navigate a target area. We compare the newly acquired test images with a database of normal images using geo-tags. For anomaly detection, a Siamese network is trained which analyses two input images for anomalies while ignoring the viewpoint differences. Further, our system is capable of updating the normal images database with human collaboration. Finally, we propose a new tester dataset that is captured by repeated visits of the robot over a constrained outdoor industrial target area.

In reality, however, we face the challenges of open-set tasks, which are also recognized as the anomaly detection problems. In these tasks, there often exist abnormal classes, which are not in the training set, and the final goal of anomaly detection is to detect the anomalies correctly so that the misclassification of them can be reduced. However, little attention has been paid to anomaly detection in marine related fields. In this paper, to help marine plankton observers to detect anomalies conveniently and efficiently, we propose an anomaly detection pipeline including both the training and the testing phases. The training phase includes two parts, the pre-training and the post-training. In the pre-training phase, we propose a new loss function to better detect the abnormal classes and classify the normal classes simultaneously, which incorporates the expected cross-entropy loss, the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence, and the Anchor loss. We conduct several experiments to show the efficacy of the proposed method and compare its performance with other competitors based on a newly released dataset of in situ marine plankton images. Numerical results show that the proposed method outperforms its competitors in terms of classification accuracy and other commonly used criteria.","doi":"10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00409","pdfPath":"/iel7/9607382/9607383/09607611.pdf","startPage":"3654","endPage":"3664","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9607383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection for In situ Marine Plankton Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9607611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection for In situ Marine Plankton Images","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9607611/","conferenceDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100017610","fundingName":"Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection for In situ Marine Plankton Images","confLoc":"Montreal, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"019100d654.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.14147S","chronDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9607382","isNumber":"9607383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9607382","xplore-issue":"9607383","articleId":"9607611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9607652,"authors":[{"name":"Thanh T.

This task, however, is error-prone and requires a high level of understanding of radiologic expertise. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (D-CNNs) have shown remarkable performance in interpreting CXR in adults. However, there is a lack of evidence indicating that D-CNNs can recognize accurately multiple lung pathologies from pediatric CXR scans. In particular, the development of diagnostic models for the detection of pediatric chest diseases faces significant challenges such as (i) lack of physician-annotated datasets and (ii) class imbalance problems. In this paper, we retrospectively collect a large dataset of 5,017 pediatric CXR scans, for which each is manually labeled by an experienced radiologist for the presence of 10 common pathologies. A D-CNN model is then trained on 3,550 annotated scans to classify multiple pediatric lung pathologies automatically. To address the high-class imbalance issue, we propose to modify and apply \"Distribution-Balanced loss\" for training D-CNNs which reshapes the standard Binary-Cross Entropy loss (BCE) to efficiently learn harder samples by down-weighting the loss assigned to the majority classes. On an independent test set of 777 studies, the proposed approach yields an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.709 (95% CI, 0.690\u20130.729). The sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score at the cutoff value are 0.722 (0.694\u20130.750), 0.579 (0.563\u20130.595), and 0.389 (0.373\u20130.405), respectively. These results significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods on most of the target diseases. Moreover, our ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed loss function compared to other standard losses, e.g., BCE and Focal Loss, for this learning task. Overall, we demonstrate the potential of D-CNNs in interpreting pediatric CXRs.","doi":"10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00370","pdfPath":"/iel7/9607382/9607383/09607652.pdf","startPage":"3307","endPage":"3316","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9607383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Automatically Diagnose Multiple Diseases in Pediatric Chest Radiographs Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9607652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Automatically Diagnose Multiple Diseases in Pediatric Chest Radiographs Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9607652/","conferenceDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Automatically Diagnose Multiple Diseases in Pediatric Chest Radiographs Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Montreal, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"019100d307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097635S","chronDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9607382","isNumber":"9607383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9607382","xplore-issue":"9607383","articleId":"9607652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9607668,"authors":[{"name":"Abbas Omidi","affiliation":["Iran University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Omidi","id":"37089158365"},{"name":"Amirhossein Heydarian","affiliation":["Iran University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Amirhossein","lastName":"Heydarian","id":"37089157312"},{"name":"Aida Mohammadshahi","affiliation":["Iran University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Aida","lastName":"Mohammadshahi","id":"37089157270"},{"name":"Behnam Asghari Beirami","affiliation":["K.

Currently, the only way to prevent this violation is to identify the violating vehicles by the highway police, so in this paper, a violation detection system using an embedded camera is introduced using algorithms based on deep learning and image processing techniques. The embedded system benefits of a multi-stage deep system based on the YOLO network, which consists of four stages of cascaded detection, including overtaking lane detection, HGV detection, license plate detection, and character recognition. In this research, the developed deep learning models, after some initial training, are fine-tuned on a local Persian dataset collected with distributed cameras. The accuracy obtained on the test dataset of each of the four separate stages was above 85% and the results show the efficiency of the proposed smart system with 70% accuracy in the union of all stages.

In this paper, we propose a method to allow deep networks to be trained on data with reduced numbers of annotations per image in heatmap regression tasks (e.g. object localisation and counting), by applying an asymmetric loss function. This reduction of annotations can be imposed by the researchers by asking annotators to intentionally label only 50% of what they see in each image - a form of \u2019few-click\u2019 annotation. Our method also has a secondary benefit of counteracting unintentionally missing labels from the annotators. We conduct experiments on wheat spikelet localisation and crowd counting to assess the effectiveness and robustness of our method. Results show that an asymmetric loss function is effective across different models and datasets, even in very extreme cases with limited annotations provided (e.g. 90% of the original annotations reduced).

A popular way to tackle this problem is by utilizing an autoencoder (AE) trained only on normal data. At test time, the AE is then expected to reconstruct the normal input well while reconstructing the anomalies poorly. However, several studies show that, even with normal data only training, AEs can often start reconstructing anomalies as well which depletes their anomaly detection performance. To mitigate this, we propose a temporal pseudo anomaly synthesizer that generates fake-anomalies using only normal data. An AE is then trained to maximize the reconstruction loss on pseudo anomalies while minimizing this loss on normal data. This way, the AE is encouraged to produce distinguishable reconstructions for normal and anomalous frames. Extensive experiments and analysis on three challenging video anomaly datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to improve the basic AEs in achieving superiority against several existing state-of-the-art models.","doi":"10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00028","pdfPath":"/iel7/9607382/9607383/09607732.pdf","startPage":"207","endPage":"214","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9607383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthetic Temporal Anomaly Guided End-to-End Video Anomaly Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9607732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Synthetic Temporal Anomaly Guided End-to-End Video Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9607732/","conferenceDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthetic Temporal Anomaly Guided End-to-End Video Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Montreal, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"019100a207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100178S","chronDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9607382","isNumber":"9607383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9607382","xplore-issue":"9607383","articleId":"9607732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9607765,"authors":[{"name":"Sakib Mostafa","affiliation":["University of Saskatchewan"],"firstName":"Sakib","lastName":"Mostafa","id":"37089156206"},{"name":"Debajyoti Mondal","affiliation":["University of Saskatchewan"],"firstName":"Debajyoti","lastName":"Mondal","id":"37072435500"},{"name":"Michael Beck","affiliation":["University of Saskatchewan"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Beck","id":"37089158289"},{"name":"Christopher Bidinosti","affiliation":["University of Saskatchewan"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Bidinosti","id":"37086641721"},{"name":"Christopher Henry","affiliation":["University of Saskatchewan"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Henry","id":"37089157923"},{"name":"Ian Stavness","affiliation":["University of Saskatchewan"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Stavness","id":"37871147900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0191-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0192-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-9944"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2473-9936"}],"articleNumber":"9607765","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9607765","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Backpropagation","Measurement","Visualization","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Plants (biology)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00157","pdfPath":"/iel7/9607382/9607383/09607765.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)","startPage":"1362","endPage":"1371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9607383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visualizing Feature Maps for Model Selection in Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are increasingly being used to achieve state-of-the-art performance for various plant phenotyping and agricultural tasks. While con-structing such CNN models, a common problem is over-parameterization, which may lead to a model becoming overfit on a training dataset. This problem is particularly relevant for plant datasets with limited variation and/or small samples sizes. Inspection of the loss and accuracy curves is a common way to detect overfitting in a CNN model, but it provides little insight into how the model could be improved. There are several reasons contributing to the overfitting of a CNN model; however, in this paper, we aim at explaining overfitting in a CNN classification model by analyzing the features learned at various depths of the model. We use three plant phenotyping datasets in our experimental studies. Our comparative analysis between the visualizations of the feature maps obtained from overfit and balanced models reveals that the image background often influences an overfit model\u2019s behavior. Researchers with limited deep learning domain knowledge often attempt to build deeper layer models with the hope of improving per-formance. Using Guided Backpropagation, we show how the pairwise similarity matrix between the visualization of the features learned at different depths can be leveraged to pave a new way to potentially select a better CNN model by removing redundant layers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9607765/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9607765/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","conferenceDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Visualizing Feature Maps for Model Selection in Convolutional Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visualizing Feature Maps for Model Selection in Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Montreal, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"019100b362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093898S","chronDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9607382","isNumber":"9607383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9607382","xplore-issue":"9607383","articleId":"9607765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9607767,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Lusardi","affiliation":["Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Lusardi","id":"37089156871"},{"name":"Abu Md Niamul Taufique","affiliation":["Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY"],"firstName":"Abu Md Niamul","lastName":"Taufique","id":"37087110935"},{"name":"Andreas Savakis","affiliation":["Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Savakis","id":"37269213600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0191-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0192-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-9944"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2473-9936"}],"articleNumber":"9607767","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Computer vision","Conferences","Benchmark testing","Feature extraction","Robustness","Graph neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9607767","abstract":"We propose a graph neural network-based framework for multi-object tracking that combines detection and association along with the use of a novel re-identification feature.

We propose a novel neural architecture dubbed as Russian doll network (RDN). Key differentiators of RDN are two-folds: first, a RDN topologically consists of a few nested sub-networks. Any smaller sub-network is completely embedded in all larger ones in a parameter-sharing manner. The computation flow of a RDN starts from the inner-most (and smallest) sub-network and sequentially executes larger ones according to the nesting order. A larger sub-network can re-use all intermediate features calculated at their inner sub-networks. This crucially ensures that each sub-network can conduct inference independently. Secondly, the nesting order of RDNs naturally plots the sequential neural path of a sample in the network. For an easy sample, much computation can be saved without much sacrifice of accuracy if an early-termination point can be intelligently determined. To this end, we formulate satisfying a specific accuracy-complexity tradeoff as a constrained optimization problem, solved via the Lagrangian multiplier theory. Comprehensive experiments of transforming several base models into RDN on ImageNet clearly demonstrate the superior accuracy-complexity balance of RDN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9607775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9607775/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Russian Doll Network: Learning Nested Networks for Sample-Adaptive Dynamic Inference","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Russian Doll Network: Learning Nested Networks for Sample-Adaptive Dynamic Inference","confLoc":"Montreal, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"019100a336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084632S","chronDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9607382","isNumber":"9607383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9607382","xplore-issue":"9607383","articleId":"9607775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-28"},{"_id":9607787,"authors":[{"name":"Shyam A.

To date, the research community has primarily focused on improving model expressiveness, with secondary thought given to how to design models that can run efficiently on resource constrained mobile devices including smartphones or mixed reality headsets. In this work we make a step towards improving the efficiency of these models by making the observation that these GNN models are heavily limited by the representational power of their first, feature extracting, layer. We find that it is possible to radically simplify these models so long as the feature extraction layer is retained with minimal degradation to model performance; further, we discover that it is possible to improve performance overall on ModelNet40 and S3DIS by improving the design of the feature extractor. Our approach reduces memory consumption by 20\u00d7 and latency by up to 9.9\u00d7 for graph layers in models such as DGCNN; overall, we achieve speed-ups of up to 4.5\u00d7 and peak memory reductions of 72.5%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9607787/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9607787/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","conferenceDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Towards Efficient Point Cloud Graph Neural Networks Through Architectural Simplification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100016311","fundingName":"Arm"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Efficient Point Cloud Graph Neural Networks Through Architectural Simplification","confLoc":"Montreal, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"019100c095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.221076S","chronDate":"11-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9607382","isNumber":"9607383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9607382","xplore-issue":"9607383","articleId":"9607787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9607810,"authors":[{"name":"Robiulhossain Mdrafi","affiliation":["Mississippi State, MS"],"firstName":"Robiulhossain","lastName":"Mdrafi","id":"37087088362"},{"name":"Ali Cafer Gurbuz","affiliation":["Mississippi State, MS"],"firstName":"Ali Cafer","lastName":"Gurbuz","id":"37266698900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0191-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0192-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-9944"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2473-9936"}],"articleNumber":"9607810","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9607810","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Weight measurement","Deep learning","Computer vision","Image coding","Conferences","Loss measurement","Robustness"]}],"abstract":"This work proposes a deep compressed learning framework inferring classification directly from the compressive measurements.

Firstly, by constructing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional candidate and using techniques of inequality and convex analysis, several criteria are obtained to reach the synchronization goal of delayed Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with state-constraint impulsive controller. Based on these criteria, the region of attraction for the synchronization error system is estimated. Secondly, the special case that only part of the states subject from saturation is also considered, and the corresponding results are obtained. Moreover, when Cohen-Grossberg neural networks are simplified to special cases such as Hopfield neural networks, our results have been improved and expanded.

Finally, the prediction result of each IMF is added to obtain the final predicted value. In this paper, the landslide displacement sequence of Baishuihe in the Three Gorges Reservoir area is taken as one case. This experiment proved the feasibility of VMD-LSTM model.

Based on the IETM, the Zeno behavior is excluded and ensures the globally exponential stability and h-stability of the neural networks by constructing Lyapunov function and some different restrictive conditions. In addition, the delay term in inertial neural networks is well dealt with the two lemmas given in this paper. It is shown that inertial delayed neural networks can be stabilized through this event-triggered impulsive control. Finally, two numerical examples and their simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of this method.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC52316.2021.9608314","startPage":"332","endPage":"337","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Neuromorphic Computing (ICNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9607522/9607892/09608314.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Neuromorphic Computing (ICNC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC52316.2021.9608314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9607892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability of Inertial Delayed Neural Networks Via Event-Triggered Impulsive Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neuromorphic engineering","Computational modeling","Neural networks","Stability criteria","Delays","Control theory","Numerical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["time-delay","inertial neural networks","globally exponential stability","h-stability","event-triggered impulsive control","Zeno behavior"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9608314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Stability of Inertial Delayed Neural Networks Via Event-Triggered Impulsive Control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9608314/","publicationDate":"15 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2021","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of Inertial Delayed Neural Networks Via Event-Triggered Impulsive Control","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"ICNC2021_86.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070467S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9607522","isNumber":"9607892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9607522","xplore-issue":"9607892","articleId":"9608314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9608391,"authors":[{"name":"Sven Nitzsche","affiliation":["FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Nitzsche","id":"37088762904"},{"name":"Brian Pachideh","affiliation":["FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Pachideh","id":"37089164637"},{"name":"Nicolas Luhn","affiliation":["FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Luhn","id":"37089165633"},{"name":"Jrgen Becker","affiliation":["Institute for Information Technology Processing (ITIV) Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Jrgen","lastName":"Becker","id":"37089174704"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1287-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4825-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9608391","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Power demand","Neuromorphic engineering","Computational modeling","Neurons","Hardware","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neuromorphic computing","spiking neuron","digital hardware implementation","FPGA","spiking neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9608391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Hardware Implementation of Optimized Spiking Neurons","doi":"10.1109/ICNC52316.2021.9608391","startPage":"126","endPage":"134","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Neuromorphic Computing (ICNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Neuromorphic Computing (ICNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9607522/9607892/09608391.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9607892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC52316.2021.9608391","abstract":"Neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks have seen growing attention lately, especially in combination with event-based sensors and in robotics. To deploy such spiking neural networks, suitable hardware platforms are required. Neuromorphic hardware can be built based on various neuron models. However, only few publications so far investigate which neuron models are best suited for hardware implementation and many platforms use simple models like leaky integrate-and-fire. This work investigates how various neuron models can be implemented in hardware, applying different optimization and approximation techniques. The optimized neurons are prototyped on a field-programmable gate array and compared based on hardware resource requirements, power consumption and accuracy versus non-optimized models. Promising candidates for hardware implementation are pointed out and different metrics are evaluated, providing a guideline to trade-off the hardware implementation and performance for different neuron types.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9608391/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2021","publicationDate":"15 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9608391/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Digital Hardware Implementation of Optimized Spiking Neurons","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Hardware Implementation of Optimized Spiking Neurons","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"ICNC2021_41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078874S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9607522","isNumber":"9607892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9607522","xplore-issue":"9607892","articleId":"9608391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-28"},{"_id":9608583,"authors":[{"name":"Jiali Zhu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics-Physics and Finance, and the Key Laboratory of Advanced Perception and Intelligent Control of High-end Equipment, Ministry of Education Anhui Polytechnic University, Wuhu, China"],"firstName":"Jiali","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37089167974"},{"name":"Hongjian Liu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics-Physics and Finance, and the Key Laboratory of Advanced Perception and Intelligent Control of High-end Equipment, Ministry of Education Anhui Polytechnic University, Wuhu, China"],"firstName":"Hongjian","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085617623"},{"name":"Huimin Tao","affiliation":["School of Mathematics-Physics and Finance, and the Key Laboratory of Advanced Perception and Intelligent Control of High-end Equipment, Ministry of Education Anhui Polytechnic University, Wuhu, China"],"firstName":"Huimin","lastName":"Tao","id":"37089166701"},{"name":"Hailong Tan","affiliation":["School of Mathematics-Physics and Finance, and the Key Laboratory of Advanced Perception and Intelligent Control of High-end Equipment, Ministry of Education Anhui Polytechnic University, Wuhu, China"],"firstName":"Hailong","lastName":"Tan","id":"37089164865"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1287-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4825-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9608583","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9608583","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${H_{\\infty }}$</tex>\n finite-horizon state estimation issue for a class of discrete-time memristive neural networks (DMNNs) with time-varying delays and multiple fading channels. A set of correlated random variables are used to study the correlated fading channels. Specifically, the channel coefficients are assumed to be scalar white noise processes satisfying certain probability distribution laws. At the same time, in order to reduce unnecessary resource consumption in the communication channel between the sensor and remote estimator, a dynamic event-triggered transmission strategy is introduced.

VVC introduces new coding tools enhancing the coding efficiency compared to its predecessor High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). These new tools have a significant impact on the VVC software decoder complexity estimated to 2 times HEVC decoder complexity. In particular, the transform module includes in VVC separable and non-separable transforms named Multiple Transform Selection (MTS) and Low Frequency Non-Separable Transform (LFNST) tools, respectively. In this paper, we present an area-efficient hardware architecture of the inverse transform module for a VVC decoder. The proposed design uses a total of 64 regular multipliers in a pipelined architecture targeting Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) platforms. It consists in a multi-standard architecture that supports the transform modules of recent MPEG standards including Advanced Video Coding (AVC), HEVC and VVC. The architecture leverages all primary and secondary transforms\u2019 optimisations including butterfly decomposition, coefficients zeroing and the inherent linear relationship between the transforms. The synthesized results show that the proposed method sustains a constant throughput of 1 sample per cycle and a constant latency for all block sizes. The proposed hardware inverse transform module operates at 600 MHz frequency enabling to decode in real-time 4K video at 30 frames per second in 4:2:2 chroma sub-sampling format.

It consumes a large amount of power in the encoder. So designing a ME module on hardware platform imposes significant challenges. Many hardware oriented integer ME (IME) algorithms have been proposed in the literature to meet the challenges but suffer from coding efficiency degradation. In this paper we propose a low complexity IME algorithm and its hardware implementation. The proposed algorithm has been shown for two different pattern structures (PS) with 38 search points. It achieves bjontegaard bitrate (BD-BR) of 0.5% decrease and 0.077% increase for two PSs compared to test zone search (TZS) in HM 16.8. It results 8.725% and 9.072% saving in encoding time respectively. The proposed architecture supports all the HEVC partitions.

However, our study of Stack Overflow questions reveals the low utilization of high-quality programming tutorials, which is caused task description mismatch and code information overload. Neither document search nor recently proposed activity-centric search can address these two barriers. In this work, we enrich the programming task knowledge graph with actions extracted from comments in code examples and more forms of activity sentences. To overcome the task description mismatch problem, we use code matching based task search method to find relevant programming tasks and code examples to the code under development. We integrate our knowledge graph and task search method in the IDE, and develop an observe-push based tool to prompt developers with API usage examples in explicit task contexts. To alleviate the code information overload problem, our tool highlights programming task and API information in the prompted tutorial excerpts and code examples based on the underlying knowledge graph. Our evaluation confirms the high quality of the constructed knowledge graph, and show that our code matching based task search can recommend effective code solutions to programming issues asked on Stack Overflow. Through an user study, we demonstrate that our tool is useful for assisting developers in finding and using relevant programming tutorials in their programming tasks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software maintenance","Codes","Search methods","Conferences","Tutorials","Programming","Tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["n/a"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSME52107.2021.00046","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9607589/9609104/09609122.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9609104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSME52107.2021.00046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task-Oriented API Usage Examples Prompting Powered By Programming Task Knowledge Graph","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9609122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Task-Oriented API Usage Examples Prompting Powered By Programming Task Knowledge Graph","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9609122/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9609122/","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task-Oriented API Usage Examples Prompting Powered By Programming Task Knowledge Graph","confLoc":"Luxembourg","sourcePdf":"288200a448.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092306S","chronDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9607589","isNumber":"9609104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9607589","xplore-issue":"9609104","articleId":"9609122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-28"},{"_id":9609124,"authors":[{"name":"Priyank Kashyap","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA"],"firstName":"Priyank","lastName":"Kashyap","id":"37086841689"},{"name":"W.

We further explored the capabilities of EvoCrash on different programs to check for selection bias. We found that we can reproduce the crashes covered by EvoCrash in the original study while reproducing two additional crashes not reported as reproduced. We also find that EvoCrash was unsuccessful in reproducing several crashes from the JCHARMING paper, which were excluded from the original study. Both EvoCrash and JCHARMING could reproduce 73% of the crashes from the JCHARMING paper. We found that there was potentially some selection bias in the dataset for EvoCrash. We also found that some crashes had been reported as non-reproducible even when EvoCrash could reproduce them. We suggest this may be due to EvoCrash becoming stuck in a local optimum.","doi":"10.1109/ICSME52107.2021.00081","startPage":"684","endPage":"688","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSME52107.2021.00081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9609104","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9607589/9609104/09609144.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Partial Reproduction of A Guided Genetic Algorithm for Automated Crash Reproduction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9609144/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Partial Reproduction of A Guided Genetic Algorithm for Automated Crash Reproduction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9609144/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Partial Reproduction of A Guided Genetic Algorithm for Automated Crash Reproduction","confLoc":"Luxembourg","sourcePdf":"288200a684.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071553S","chronDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9607589","isNumber":"9609104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9607589","xplore-issue":"9609104","articleId":"9609144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9609225,"authors":[{"name":"Nikita Ambasana","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 3D Systems Packaging Research Center (PRC), Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Nikita","lastName":"Ambasana","id":"37085564737"},{"name":"Osama W.

We then compare them to the ones obtained by the INN.

Smart contract vulnerabilities however made them a prime target to malicious attacks that are leading to huge losses. The research community is thus applying various software engineering technologies to smart contracts to address them. In general, to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, mutation and fuzz based testing approaches have been widely studied and indeed achieved promising performance on benchmark datasets. Generating test inputs with mutation approaches essentially relies on the available test cases in a smart contract program. In our preliminary study, however, we observed that 56.4% of 218 identified open-source smart contract project repositories do not provide any test case for validation. Fuzzing test inputs leads to random values and lacks practical usefulness. Our work addresses this problem: we propose an approach, Smartgift, which generates practical inputs for testing smart contracts by learning from the transaction records of real-world smart contracts. Leveraging a collected set of over 60 thousand transaction records, Smartgift is able to generate relevant test inputs for ~77% smart contract functions, largely outperforming the traditional fuzzing approach (successful for only 60% functions). We further demonstrate the practicality of the test inputs by using them to replace the test inputs of the ContractFuzzer state of the art smart contract vulnerability detector: with inputs by Smartgift, ContractFuzzer can now detect 131 of the 154 vulnerabilities in its benchmark.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software maintenance","Conferences","Smart contracts","Bit error rate","Prototypes","Fuzzing","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Test Input Generation","Smart Contract","Deep Learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSME52107.2021.00009","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9607589/9609104/09609227.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9609104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSME52107.2021.00009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SmartGift: Learning to Generate Practical Inputs for Testing Smart Contracts","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9609227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SmartGift: Learning to Generate Practical Inputs for Testing Smart Contracts","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9609227/","isConference":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9609227/","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB1005500,2020AAA0107704"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004193","fundingName":"Open Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Safety-Critical Software (NUAA)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006579","fundingName":"Ministry of Industry and Information Technology","grantNumber":"XCA20026"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010661","fundingName":"European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme","grantNumber":"949014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"SmartGift: Learning to Generate Practical Inputs for Testing Smart Contracts","confLoc":"Luxembourg","sourcePdf":"288200a023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133741S","chronDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9607589","isNumber":"9609104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9607589","xplore-issue":"9609104","articleId":"9609227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-28"},{"_id":9609243,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-5888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0792"}],"articleNumber":"9609243","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9609243","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3124108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","abstract":"This index covers all technical items - papers, correspondence, reviews, etc. - that appeared in this periodical during the year, and items from previous years that were commented upon or corrected in this year.

Moreover, information retrieval in offline doctor\u2019s prescription images was not being focused prior the Covid - 19 pandemic. However, over the last two years such prescription images are extensively being exchanged by the patients\u2019 among offline medical consultants for useful advice. Therefore, in this paper the potential concern has been expressed on using computer technology to assess handwriting. Character recognition from the connected alphabets of a word (cursive writing) is a real time challenge. For this, the usage of Extended MNIST has been explored and the results support the efficiency of proposed model to identify the poor legibility of handwriting and transform it into readable correct text recognition. Further, using proposed model of the system the handwritten medical prescription can be converted digitally using electronic writing pad. Such facility will enables patient to take away prescription in the form of digital media which can further be recognized by running it on our model. The application areas wherein the proposed character recognition system can be utilized are recognizing medicine names from doctor\u2019s prescription, historical document recognition, automatic reading of bank\u2019s cheque, automatic postal code identification, converting handwriting in real time, extracting data from filled-in forms etc.","doi":"10.1109/ISPCC53510.2021.9609390","startPage":"46","endPage":"50","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Signal Processing, Computing and Control (ISPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9609332/9609334/09609390.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Signal Processing, Computing and Control (ISPCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPCC53510.2021.9609390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9609334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medical Handwritten Prescription Recognition and Information Retrieval using Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handwriting recognition","Image recognition","Text recognition","Signal processing algorithms","Medical services","Writing","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Handwriting Recognition","Neural Network","Medical Prescription","Segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9609390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Medical Handwritten Prescription Recognition and Information Retrieval using Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9609390/","publicationDate":"7 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2021","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medical Handwritten Prescription Recognition and Information Retrieval using Neural Network","confLoc":"Solan, India","sourcePdf":"10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066302S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9609332","isNumber":"9609334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9609332","xplore-issue":"9609334","articleId":"9609390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9609408,"authors":[{"name":"Ajay Sharma","affiliation":["Jaypee University Of Information Technology (JUIT), Solan, India"],"firstName":"Ajay","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37087502375"},{"name":"Raj Kumar","affiliation":["Jaypee University Of Information Technology (JUIT), Solan, India"],"firstName":"Raj","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37088730763"},{"name":"Varun Jaiswal","affiliation":["Bokjeong-dong, Sujeong-gu, Gachon University, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea"],"firstName":"Varun","lastName":"Jaiswal","id":"37086095474"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2554-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2555-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2643-8615"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2376-5461"}],"articleNumber":"9609408","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9609408","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart","Training","Solid modeling","Recurrent neural networks","Three-dimensional displays","Computational modeling","Magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Learning","Heart Disease","CNN","Image Processing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISPCC53510.2021.9609408","pdfPath":"/iel7/9609332/9609334/09609408.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Signal Processing, Computing and Control (ISPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Signal Processing, Computing and Control (ISPCC)","startPage":"358","endPage":"363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9609334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPCC53510.2021.9609408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Heart Disease from MRI Images Using Convolutional Neural Network","abstract":"In this paper, we have demonstrated a CAD architecture for heart disease based on the Convolutional Neural Network.

This paper analyzes the two most important algorithms for estimating the direction of arrival (DOA) of an acoustic source applied on a uniform linear arrangement of microphones. These are minimum-variance-distortionless-response (MVDR) and conventional delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming. These algorithms calculate array weights. The basic idea behind calculating array weights is to maximize the gain in direction of concern and reducing the power in unwanted directions. In DAS, array weights are assumed to be constant and of equal magnitude irrespective of the input whereas in MVDR the weighting of elements is changed based on the input signals, or the array weights are adapted to the input. The parameter that has been used for the performance comparison of both the algorithms is root-mean-square-angular-error (RMSAE). The simulation results, in this paper, strengthens the fact that the MVDR algorithm overrules and outperforms the conventional DAS beamforming technique.","doi":"10.1109/ISPCC53510.2021.9609436","pdfPath":"/iel7/9609332/9609334/09609436.pdf","startPage":"576","endPage":"580","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Signal Processing, Computing and Control (ISPCC)","publicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Signal Processing, Computing and Control (ISPCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPCC53510.2021.9609436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9609334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative Analysis of Conventional and Adaptive beamforming for Linear Array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9609436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Comparative Analysis of Conventional and Adaptive beamforming for Linear Array","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2021","publicationDate":"7 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9609436/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Analysis of Conventional and Adaptive beamforming for Linear Array","confLoc":"Solan, India","sourcePdf":"112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09214S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9609332","isNumber":"9609334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9609332","xplore-issue":"9609334","articleId":"9609436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9609533,"authors":[{"name":"Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Felipe","lastName":"Gutierrez-Barragan","orcid":"0000-0002-6378-168X","id":"37087234998"},{"name":"Huaijin Chen","affiliation":["SenseBrain Technology, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Huaijin","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-7337-149X","id":"37089014048"},{"name":"Mohit Gupta","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Mohit","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37416652700"},{"name":"Andreas Velten","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Velten","id":"37545555800"},{"name":"Jinwei Gu","affiliation":["SenseBrain Technology, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jinwei","lastName":"Gu","id":"37089186092"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2333-9403"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-0118"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2573-0436"}],"articleNumber":"9609533","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9609533","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transient analysis","Frequency measurement","Signal to noise ratio","Cameras","Optical sensors","Frequency estimation","Optical imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Depth sensing","time-of-flight"]}],"abstract":"Indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) cameras are a promising depth sensing technology. However, they are prone to errors caused by multi-path interference (MPI) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Traditional methods, after denoising, mitigate MPI by estimating a transient image that encodes depths. Recently, data-driven methods that jointly denoise and mitigate MPI have become state-of-the-art without using the intermediate transient representation. In this paper, we propose to revisit the transient representation. Using data-driven priors, we interpolate/extrapolate iToF frequencies and use them to estimate the transient image. Given direct ToF (dToF) sensors capture transient images, we name our method iToF2dToF. The transient representation is flexible. It can be integrated with different rule-based depth sensing algorithms that are robust to low SNR and can deal with ambiguous scenarios that arise in practice (e.g., specular MPI, optical cross-talk). We demonstrate the benefits of iToF2dToF over previous methods in real depth sensing scenarios.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9318600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2021.3126533","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745852/9318600/09609533.pdf","startPage":"1205","endPage":"1214","doi":"10.1109/TCI.2021.3126533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"iToF2dToF: A Robust and Flexible Representation for Data-Driven Time-of-Flight Imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"iToF2dToF: A Robust and Flexible Representation for Data-Driven Time-of-Flight Imaging","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/9609533/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9609533/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan internship at SenseBrain Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"iToF2dToF: A Robust and Flexible Representation for Data-Driven Time-of-Flight Imaging","sourcePdf":"tci-gutierrezbarragan-3126533-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11626S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"9318600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","xplore-issue":"9318600","articleId":"9609533","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9609538,"authors":[{"name":"Dixit Bhatta","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Dixit","lastName":"Bhatta","orcid":"0000-0002-1136-9861"},{"name":"Lena Mashayekhy","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Lena","lastName":"Mashayekhy","orcid":"0000-0002-5096-9333"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2183"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9883"}],"articleNumber":"9609538","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"Emerging applications with low-latency requirements such as real-time analytics, immersive media applications, and intelligent virtual assistants have rendered Edge Computing as a critical computing infrastructure. Existing studies have explored the cloudlet placement problem in a homogeneous scenario with different goals such as latency minimization, load balancing, energy efficiency, and placement cost minimization. However, placing cloudlets in a highly heterogeneous deployment scenario considering the next-generation 5G networks and IoT applications is still an open challenge. The novel requirements of these applications indicate that there is still a gap in ensuring low-latency service guarantees when deploying cloudlets. Furthermore, deploying cloudlets in a cost-effective manner and ensuring full coverage for all users in edge computing are other critical conflicting issues. In this article, we address these issues by designing a bifactor approximation algorithm to solve the heterogeneous cloudlet placement problem to guarantee a bounded latency and placement cost, while fully mapping user applications to appropriate cloudlets. We first formulate the problem as a multi-objective integer programming model and show that it is a computationally NP-hard problem. We then propose a bifactor approximation algorithm, ACP, to tackle its intractability. We investigate the effectiveness of ACP by performing extensive theoretical analysis and experiments on multiple deployment scenarios based on New York City OpenData. We prove that ACP provides a (2,4)-approximation ratio for the latency and the placement cost. The experimental results show that ACP obtains near-optimal results in a polynomial running time making it suitable for both short-term and long-term cloudlet placement in heterogeneous deployment scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bifactor Approximation Algorithm for Cloudlet Placement in Edge Computing","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3126256","endPage":"1798","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9642402/09609538.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"1787","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3126256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9642402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9609538","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Costs","Approximation algorithms","Edge computing","Servers","Low latency communication","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge computing","cloudlets","placement cost","latency","full coverage","approximation algorithm"]}],"supplementGroup":[{"repository":"code-ocean","type":"algorithm","badge":"Reviewed","badgeMsg":"This document includes code submitted by the author.","supplement":[{"doi":"10.24433/CO.4921212.v1","uri":"https://codeocean.com/capsule/7976302/tree/v1","name":"Bifactor Approx Cloudlet Placement","language":"Java","widgetUrl":"https://codeocean.com/widget.js?slug=7976302&v=1","badgeType":"Code-Reviewed"}]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Bifactor Approximation Algorithm for Cloudlet Placement in Edge Computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9609538/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2022","volume":"33","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1755913"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bifactor Approximation Algorithm for Cloudlet Placement in Edge Computing","sourcePdf":"tpds-mashayekhy-3126256-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055372S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2022","isNumber":"9642402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","articleId":"9609538","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":9609603,"authors":[{"name":"Wanlu Shi","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China","Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9609603/shi-3125609-small.gif","p":["Wanlu Shi was born in Daqing, Heilongjiang Province, P.

Such arrays lead to a significant increase in the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) when the second-order information is utilized, i.e., they provide long virtual difference coarrays (DCAs). Thus, the idea of this paper is based on the observation that SAs can be fitted through the concatenations of sub-ULAs. A corresponding SA design principle, called ULA fitting, is then proposed. It aims to design SAs from multiple sub-ULAs. Towards this goal, a polynomial model for arrays is used, and based on it, a DCA structure is analyzed for the general case when an SA is composed of an arbitrary number of sub-ULAs. ULA fitting enables to transfer SA design requirements, such as hole\u2013free, low mutual coupling, and other requirements, into pseudo-polynomial equation, and hence, find particular solutions. We mainly focus on designing SAs with low mutual coupling and large uniform DOF. Two examples of SAs with closed-form expressions are then developed based on ULA fitting. Numerical experiments verify the superiority of the proposed SAs in the presence of heavy mutual coupling.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3125609","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09609603.pdf","startPage":"6431","endPage":"6447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3125609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ULA Fitting for Sparse Array Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9609603/","displayDocTitle":"ULA Fitting for Sparse Array Design","volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9609603/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China scholarship council","grantNumber":"201906680047"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3072019GIP0808"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"319822"},{"fundingName":"Advanced Marine Communication and Information Technology, MIIT, China","grantNumber":"AMCIT2101-03"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3072021CF0804"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011421","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves","grantNumber":"K2020017"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFE0111100"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ULA Fitting for Sparse Array Design","sourcePdf":"tsp-li-3125609-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11394S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9609603","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9609610,"authors":[{"name":"Yusheng Hua","affiliation":["Services Computing Technology and System Lab, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yusheng","lastName":"Hua"},{"name":"Xuanhua Shi","affiliation":["Services Computing Technology and System Lab, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Xuanhua","lastName":"Shi","orcid":"0000-0001-8451-8656"},{"name":"Kang He","affiliation":["Services Computing Technology and System Lab, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"He"},{"name":"Hai Jin","affiliation":["Services Computing Technology and System Lab, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Jin","orcid":"0000-0002-3934-7605"},{"name":"Wei Xie","affiliation":["VMware Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xie"},{"name":"Ligang He","affiliation":["University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K"],"firstName":"Ligang","lastName":"He","orcid":"0000-0002-5671-0576"},{"name":"Yong Chen","affiliation":["Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-9961-9051"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2183"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9883"}],"articleNumber":"9609610","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"Device-level interference is recognized as a major cause of the performance degradation in distributed file systems. Although the approaches of mitigating interference through coordination at application-level, middleware-level, and server-level have shown beneficial results in previous studies, we find their effectiveness is largely reduced since I/O requests are re-arranged by underlying object file systems. In this research study, we prove that object-level coordination is critical and often the key to address the interference issue, as the scheduling of object requests determines the device-level accesses and thus determines the actual I/O bandwidth and latency. This article proposes an object-level coordination system, LoomIO, which uses an OBOP (One-Broadcast-One-Propagate) method and a time-limited coordination process to deliver highly efficient coordination service. Specifically, LoomIO enables object requests to achieve an optimized scheduling decision within a few milliseconds and largely mitigates the device-level interference. We have implemented a LoomIO prototye and integrated it into Ceph file system. The evaluation results show that LoomIO achieved the considerable improvements in resource utilization (by up to 35%), in I/O throughput (by up to 31%), and in 99th percentile latency (by up to 54%) compared to the K-optimal method which uses the same scheduling algorithm as LoomIO but does not have the coordination support.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LoomIO: Object-Level Coordination in Distributed File Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3126260","endPage":"1810","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9642402/09609610.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"1799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3126260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9642402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9609610","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Layout","Performance evaluation","Throughput","Redundancy","Receivers","Encoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed object file system","I/O coordination","performance","erasure-coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"LoomIO: Object-Level Coordination in Distributed File Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9609610/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2022","volume":"33","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020AAA0108501"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772218"},{"fundingName":"Key R&D Program of Hubei","grantNumber":"2020BAA020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LoomIO: Object-Level Coordination in Distributed File Systems","sourcePdf":"tpds-shi-3126260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049615S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2022","isNumber":"9642402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","articleId":"9609610","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9609631,"authors":[{"name":"Lulu Wan","affiliation":["China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/9314330/9609631/wan-3126755-small.gif","p":["Lulu Wan received the B.S. degree in geographic information science from Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China, in 2018.

The traditional linear unmixing model assumes that each mixed pixel can be represented by a linear combination of endmembers. Considering real-world situations, a sparse constraint is normally added to the linear unmixing model. However, the linear model does not take into account that the spectrum of mixed pixels is not simply linearly mixed. To fully study the mixing characteristics of ground object spectra before being imaged by the sensor, we propose a supervised unmixing architecture based on a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) by considering the spectral information and the sparse characteristics in the mixed pixel. Since 1-D CNN only considers feature learning, we combine the traditional root-mean-square error (RMSE) and \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\ell _{1}}$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n regularization in its loss function to minimize training error. The performance of our proposed unmixing model is assessed by comparing the unmixing results with three traditional linear sparse unmixing algorithms and the fuzzy ARTMAP neural network in a simulated dataset and three real datasets. The RMSE was used to verify the unmixing accuracy of the different methods. The results showed that the RMSE obtained by our proposed CNN-based method was the lowest among the methods on all three real datasets, proving the effectiveness and stability of the CNN in unmixing tasks.","topic":"Hyperspectral imaging and data exploitation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9609631/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"14","htmlLink":"/document/9609631/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Unmixing Based on Spectral and Sparse Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62071439 and 61871259"},{"fundingName":"Opening Foundation of Qilian Mountain National Park Research Center","grantNumber":"GKQ2019-01"},{"fundingName":"Opening Foundation of Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Spatial Information Engineering","grantNumber":"20210209"},{"fundingName":"Opening Foundation of Geomatics Technology and Application Key Laboratory of Qinghai Province","grantNumber":"QHDX-2019-01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Hyperspectral Unmixing Based on Spectral and Sparse Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"jstars-chen-3126755-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110958S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"9314330","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","xplore-issue":"9314330","topics":["Hyperspectral imaging and data exploitation"],"articleId":"9609631","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9609667,"authors":[{"name":"Jaweria Amjad","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Univeristy College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9609667/jawer-3125601-small.gif","p":["Jaweria Amjad received the Bachelors in Engineering (B.E.) and Masters in Sciences (M.S.) degrees from the National University of Science and Technology, Pakistan, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

It is therefore natural to ask whether such knowledge of the forward operator can be exploited in deep learning approaches increasingly used to solve inverse problems. In this paper, we provide one such way via an analysis of the generalisation error of deep learning approaches to inverse problems. In particular, by building on the algorithmic robustness framework, we offer a generalisation error bound that encapsulates key ingredients associated with the learning problem such as the complexity of the data space, the size of the training set, the Jacobian of the deep neural network and the Jacobian of the composition of the forward operator with the neural network. We then propose a \u2018plug-and-play\u2019 regulariser that leverages the knowledge of the forward map to improve the generalization of the network. We likewise also use a new method allowing us to tightly upper bound the Jacobians of the relevant operators that is much more computationally efficient than existing ones. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model-aware regularised deep learning algorithms against other state-of-the-art approaches on inverse problems involving various sub-sampling operators such as those used in classical compressed sensing tasks, image super-resolution problems and accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) setups.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9609667","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09609667.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3125601","startPage":"6371","endPage":"6385","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3125601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9609667/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Model-Aware Regulatization With Applications to Inverse Problems","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"69","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9609667/","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in U.K."},{"fundingName":"China Scholarship Commission"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/P02243X/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning Model-Aware Regulatization With Applications to Inverse Problems","sourcePdf":"tsp-amjad-3125601-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108321S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9609667","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9609708,"authors":[{"name":"Charleen","affiliation":["Computer Science, Binus University, Jakarta, Indonesia"],"lastName":"Charleen"},{"name":"Cheryl Angelica","affiliation":["Computer Science, Binus University, Jakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Cheryl","lastName":"Angelica"},{"name":"Hendrik Purnama","affiliation":["Computer Science, Binus University, Jakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Hendrik","lastName":"Purnama"},{"name":"Fredy Purnomo","affiliation":["Computer Science, Binus University, Jakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Fredy","lastName":"Purnomo"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4002-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4003-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9609708","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"abstract":"Medical experts are usually the ones who analyze the interpretations of medical data.

The other example of techniques used in this paper is the Random Walk which come from Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) library of R language which approximate the Bayesian Inference. Both methods are used to get the best prediction result. To get some comparison, the data can be split to several period and from several choices, the best result can be generated.

Specifically recurrent architectures based on long-short term memory (LSTM) cells have manifested excellent capability to model time dependencies in real-world data. However, standard recurrent architectures cannot estimate their uncertainty which is essential for safety-critical applications such as in medicine. In contrast, Bayesian recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are able to provide uncertainty estimation with improved accuracy. Nonetheless, Bayesian RNNs are computationally and memory demanding, which limits their practicality despite their advantages. To address this issue, we propose an FPGA-based hardware design to accelerate Bayesian LSTM-based RNNs. To further improve the overall algorithmic-hardware performance, a co-design framework is proposed to explore the most fitting algorithmic-hardware configurations for Bayesian RNNs. We conduct extensive experiments on healthcare applications to demonstrate the improvement of our design and the effectiveness of our framework. Compared with GPU implementation, our FPGA-based design can achieve up to 10 times speedup with nearly 106 times higher energy efficiency.

To solve this problem, we propose a Two-branch Asymmetric Model with Alternately Clustering. Specifically, the designed Alternately Clustering (AC) strategy leverages a two-branch model to cluster different pseudo labels for each branch, which prevents the continuous existence of identical noisy labels. To establish a mapping between the two label sets, pseudo label mapping constraint (PLMC) module is devised, which helps retain reliable pseudo labels. Our method improves the quality of generated pseudo labels by keeping noisy labels changing and retaining the reliable ones.
