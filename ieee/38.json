The common approach is to identify and remove redundancy from the input data stream using knowledge of the source characteristics. In the case of signals intended for human observers (speech, music, pictures, etc.) it is also useful to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the human sensory systems in order to achieve a greater degree of data compression. Unfortunately, achieving perceptually transparent compression requires considerable computational resources. For situations requiring extremely low computational complexity without strictly transparent coding, such as multimedia applications on personal computer platforms, a new adaptive differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) data compression scheme is proposed. Although standard DPCM structures are widely used in single-talker speech coding systems, the models and statistical assumptions well-known for speech signals are not applicable to arbitrary audio signals such as music. The new DPCM formulation presented includes a recursively indexed quantizer (RIQ) to eliminate the problem of overload distortion, a simple predictor structure to take advantage of the short-term correlation present in wideband audio signals, and an adaptation strategy to optimize the system to the local statistics of the input signal. Thus, the new RIQ-DPCM formulation is presented as a computationally efficient means of wideband audio compression.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data compression","Humans","Multiple signal classification","Pulse modulation","Speech coding","Wideband","Bandwidth","Streaming media","Computational complexity","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio coding","data compression","differential pulse code modulation","quantisation (signal)","adaptive signal processing","prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RIQ-DPCM","digital data compression","input data stream","source characteristics","human sensory systems","data compression","multimedia applications","personal computer","adaptive differential pulse code modulation","DPCM","speech coding systems","speech signals","music","recursively indexed quantizer","predictor structure","short-term correlation","local statistics","input signal","wideband audio signal compression"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=380002","doi":"10.1109/ASPAA.1993.380002","startPage":"35","endPage":"38","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","pdfPath":"/iel2/3039/8632/00380002.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPAA.1993.380002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380002/","displayDocTitle":"Computationally efficient compression of audio signals by means of RIQ-DPCM","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4873940","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally efficient compression of audio signals by means of RIQ-DPCM","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00380002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062128S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3039","citationCount":"2","articleId":"380002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":380007,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This mix of complexity and performance is similar to the recently introduced fast Newton transversal filter (FNTF) algorithm. While FAP shares some similar properties with FNTF it is derived from a different perspective, namely the generalization of the affine projection interpretation of NLMS. FAP relies on a sliding windowed fast RLS (FRLS) algorithm to generate forward and backward prediction vectors and expected prediction error energies. Since sliding windowed FRLS algorithms easily incorporate regularization of the implicit inverse of the covariance matrix, FAP is regularized as well.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Filtering algorithms","Financial advantage program","Resonance light scattering","Covariance matrix","Convergence","Transversal filters","Additive noise","Acoustics","Least squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","recursive filters","least mean squares methods","echo suppression","covariance matrices","convergence of numerical methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity adaptive filtering algorithm","fast affine projections","recursive least squares like convergence","tracking","normalized least mean squares like complexity","performance","fast Newton transversal filter algorithm","affine projection interpretation","sliding windowed fast RLS algorithm","backward prediction vectors","forward prediction vectors","prediction error energies","regularization","covariance matrix","echo cancellation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASPAA.1993.380010","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","pdfPath":"/iel2/3039/8632/00380010.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPAA.1993.380010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast converging, low complexity adaptive filtering algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=380010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A fast converging, low complexity adaptive filtering algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380010/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4873932","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast converging, low complexity adaptive filtering algorithm","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00380010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053171S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3039","citationCount":"25","articleId":"380010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":380019,"authors":[{"name":"B.T.

However, for high performance systems, this technique requires a large number of simulation trials for the estimates to be in a reasonable interval of confidence, with the number of trials increasing linearly with the performance of the system. We apply an importance sampling technique to estimate the performance of direct detection optical systems, where the \"gain\" of importance sampling over Monte Carlo simulations is shown to increase linearly with the system performance. Further, we use this technique to study the performance of optical communication systems employing avalanche photodetectors as well as fibre-optic code division multiple access systems (FO-CDMA). We also show that the quick simulation technique developed can be used for a wide variety of coding schemes, and for the first time, we present a comparative analysis of the performance of FO-CDMA systems employing optical orthogonal codes and prime sequences. In all cases, it is shown that importance sampling simulations require less than 50-100 trials for estimating error probabilities of 10/sup -10/ and below.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380041/","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","accessionNumber":"4964096","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Importance sampling for analysis of direct detection optical communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Importance sampling for analysis of direct detection optical communication systems","sourcePdf":"00380041.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058219S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","articleId":"380041","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":380042,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A Monte Carlo simulation approach can offer an attractive alternative. However, for typical optical systems, this approach would require an excessive amount of computer time. Importance sampling (IS) is a variance reduction method which can substantially increase the computational efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations. This paper presents an IS method to efficiently evaluate the BERs of direct-detection optical systems employing avalanche photodiode (APD) receivers. Specifically, using a heuristic argument based on large deviations theory, a large class /spl Fscr/ of exponentially twisted sampling distributions for the APD-based receiver is developed. It is then demonstrated that when used as a sampling distribution, the \"optimized\" exponentially twisted distribution of large deviations theory is the most efficient distribution among the sampling distributions in /spl Fscr/. Further, it is demonstrated that such a distribution would estimate the performance of optical systems with a high degree of accuracy to warrant its possible use as a powerful and flexible tool in computer-aided design, analysis and modeling of fiber-optic transmission systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380042.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"251","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.380042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=380042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of digital lightwave systems using efficient computer simulation techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Optical receivers","Sampling methods","Power capacitors","Bit error rate","Ultraviolet sources","Optical computing","Monte Carlo methods","Computational efficiency","Avalanche photodiodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","signal sampling","optical fibre communication","avalanche photodiodes","optical receivers","telecommunication computing","digital communication","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","digital lightwave systems","computer simulation","analytically-based methods","bit error rates","Monte Carlo simulation","importance sampling","variance reduction method","computational efficiency","direct-detection optical systems","avalanche photodiode receivers","heuristic argument","large deviations theory","exponentially twisted sampling distributions","computer-aided design","modeling","fiber-optic transmission systems","error probabilities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of digital lightwave systems using efficient computer simulation techniques","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4964097","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of digital lightwave systems using efficient computer simulation techniques","sourcePdf":"00380042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033953S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"19","articleId":"380042","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":380043,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Improvements in the performance of a concatenated coding system that uses VA decoding (inner decoder) can be obtained when, in addition to the standard VA output, an indicator of the reliability of the VA decision is delivered to the outer stage of processing. Two different approaches of extending the VA are considered. In the first approach, the VA is extended with a soft output (SOVA) unit that calculates reliability values for each of the decoded output information symbols. In the second approach, coding gains are obtained by delivering a list of the L best estimates of the transmitted data sequence, namely the list Viterbi decoding algorithm (LVA). Our main interest is to evaluate the LVA and the SOVA in comparison with each other, determine suitable applications for both algorithms and to construct extended versions of the LVA and the SOVA with low complexity that perform the task of the other algorithm. We define a list output VA using the output symbol reliability information of the SOVA to generate a list of size L and that also has a lower complexity than the regular LVA for a long list size. We evaluate the list-SOVA in comparison to the LVA. Further, we introduce a low complexity soft symbol output viterbi algorithm that accepts the (short) list output of the LVA and calculates for each of the decoded information bits a reliability value. The complexity and the performance of the soft-LVA (LVA and soft decoding unit) is a function of the list size L. The performance of the soft-LVA and the SOVA are compared in a concatenated coding system. A new software implementation of the iterative serial version of the LVA is also included.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.380046","startPage":"277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380046.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380046","endPage":"287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"List and soft symbol output Viterbi algorithms: extensions and comparisons","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380046/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","displayDocTitle":"List and soft symbol output Viterbi algorithms: extensions and comparisons","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4959273","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"List and soft symbol output Viterbi algorithms: extensions and comparisons","sourcePdf":"00380046.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051213S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"58","articleId":"380046","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":380047,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The algorithm consists of signal-by-signal hard decoding followed by a search for the most likely error sequence. The number of error sequences to be considered is substantially larger than in hard decoding, since the metric applied to the error bits is the magnitude of the log likelihood ratio rather than the Hamming weight. An error-trellis (alternatively, a decoding table) is employed for describing the recursion equations of the decoding procedure. The number of its states is determined by the states indicator, which is a modified version of the constraint length of the check matrix. Methods devised for eliminating error patterns and degenerating error-trellis sections enable accelerated ML decoding.

This principle stems from the idea that data-aided estimation of unknown parameters may be embedded into the structure of the Viterbi algorithm itself. Among the numerous possible applications, the authors concentrate on (a) adaptive MLSE, (b) simultaneous trellis coded modulation (TCM) decoding and phase synchronization, (c) adaptive reduced state sequence estimation (RSSE). As a matter of fact, PSP is interpretable as a generalization of decision feedback techniques of RSSE to decoding in the presence of unknown parameters. A number of algorithms for the simultaneous estimation of data sequence and unknown channel parameters are presented and compared with \"conventional\" techniques based on the use of tentative decisions. Results for uncoded modulations over interSymbol interference (ISI) fading channels and joint TCM decoding and carrier synchronization are presented. In all cases, it is found that PSP algorithms are clearly more robust than conventional techniques both in tracking a time-varying channel and acquiring its characteristics without training.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380054/","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","accessionNumber":"4959281","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Per-Survivor Processing: a general approach to MLSE in uncertain environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Per-Survivor Processing: a general approach to MLSE in uncertain environments","sourcePdf":"00380054.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066211S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"526","articleId":"380054","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":380055,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

Suboptimal realizations of the multi-element detector are considered, offering reduced complexity as compared to the optimum solution. The performance of the multi-element detector is analyzed in terms of error probability, detection asymptotic efficiency and near-far resistance. In particular, the effects of array beamforming on the performance is discussed and shown to generalize existing results for the scalar (single channel) case.

The derivation of the decision-feedback detector is based on spectral factorization which leads to a white-noise channel model.

Unfortunately, analysis of optical CDMA (OCDMA) systems has been almost exclusively restricted to systems employing a correlation detector, which suffer high degradation when received user powers are dissimilar. This study examines the performance of an optimum single-user detector and two multiuser detectors for OCDMA in the presence of additive light intensity noise and Poisson detection. The optimized single-user detector is the maximum likelihood detector given the interference from other users is a random process with known distribution. One multiuser detector is based on a local search algorithm for maximizing the likelihood function. The second multiuser detector is a generalization of the optical multistage detector to accept soft-decision from the previous stage. Approximations to the error probabilities of the OCDMA system based on either random signature sequences or deterministic codes are derived for each detector using a large deviations theory approach. The asymptotic multiuser efficiency is found to be related to the large deviations rate function. The analysis shows that the correlation detector performance decreases rapidly as the number of users increases, while the optimized single-user detector and the two multiuser detectors proposed perform considerably better and show less sensitivity to unequal received user powers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.380061","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"435","endPage":"444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of single-user and multiuser detectors for optical code division multiple access communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Detectors","Multiaccess communication","Optical sensors","Optical noise","Maximum likelihood detection","Additive noise","Code division multiplexing","Degradation","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","optical communication","maximum likelihood detection","decision feedback equalisers","error statistics","random processes","correlation theory","deterministic algorithms","optical noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","single-user detectors","multiuser detectors","optical CDMA communication systems","multiplexing scheme","correlation detector","degradation","OCDMA","additive light intensity noise","Poisson detection","maximum likelihood detector","interference","random process","local search algorithm","optical multistage detector","soft-decision","error probabilities","random signature sequences","deterministic codes","large deviations theory approach","asymptotic multiuser efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of single-user and multiuser detectors for optical code division multiple access communication systems","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4964103","publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380061/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of single-user and multiuser detectors for optical code division multiple access communication systems","sourcePdf":"00380061.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040112S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"32","articleId":"380061","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":380066,"authors":[{"name":"S.V.

A \"serial\" coding architecture for optical CDMA has been introduced and found particularly suitable for waveguide implementation with high power efficiency. Since the optical encoder is made of a serial combination of 2/spl times/2 optical switches with n of them being biased to a \"mix-split\" state, the generated OOC's, so-called 2/sup n/ codes, pose with a symmetric delay-distribution property. Various techniques for algebraically constructing such 2/sup n/ codes of weight 4 are presented. The upper bounds on the cardinalities of these codes are also provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380068.pdf","startPage":"495","endPage":"502","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.380068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=380068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the construction of 2/sup n/ codes for optical code-division multiple-access","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Autocorrelation","Optical waveguides","Optical waveguide components","Optical switches","Delay","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic codes","codes","code division multiple access","optical switches","optical waveguides","optical fibre networks","optical fibre communication","optical correlation","encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical code-division multiple-access","2/sup n/ codes","correlation properties","high autocorrelation peaks","low sidelobes","low crosscorrelation values","serial coding architecture","waveguide implementation","high power efficiency","optical encoder","optical switches","symmetric delay-distribution","algebraically constructed codes","code weight","upper bounds","cardinalities","optical fibre CDMA networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","displayDocTitle":"On the construction of 2/sup n/ codes for optical code-division multiple-access","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4959288","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the construction of 2/sup n/ codes for optical code-division multiple-access","sourcePdf":"00380068.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03724S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"15","articleId":"380068","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":380070,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

Vector quantization has been applied to the problem of displaying natural images with a reduced set of colors (colormap) and to the interframe coding of image sequences. The first step was to test classical Linde Buzo Gray (LGB), self organizing feature maps (SOFM) and Competitive Learning (CL) algorithms for the codebook design. The best results for the reconstructed quality image and the computational time are obtained using a CL algorithm with a new initialization strategy that solves the problem of underutilized nodes. An adaptive vector quantization algorithm is proposed and tested in a motion compensated image coder. The results of the simulations are very promising. In fact the coder performance, compared with that using a fixed VQ, is considerably improved and the subjective quality of the coded images is much better than that obtained using standard vector quantization, especially when rapid motion is present in the scene.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.380072","startPage":"534","endPage":"544","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380072.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive vector quantization for picture coding using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380072/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive vector quantization for picture coding using neural networks","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4959292","publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive vector quantization for picture coding using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00380072.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050293S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","articleId":"380072","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":380075,"authors":[{"name":"V.M.

In addition to the thermal noise, in many applications such detectors are faced with the \"self-noise\", due to the partial period correlations. Under the random code sequences assumption, in this paper an exact analysis of the non-coherent correlator's detection performance is carried out by using the theory of circularly symmetric random variables. The exact analysis shows that the familiar Gaussian approximation to the distribution function of the code self-noise is justified for all cases of practical interest. Furthermore, the overall detection performance was found to be determined asymptotically by the sum of the thermal and correlator's self-noise. In most cases of practical interest, this asymptotic result provides a very good approximation to the actual detection performance of a non-coherent correlator, improving the approximations devised previously.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of non-coherent correlation in DS/BPSK spread spectrum acquisition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.380075","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380075.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=380075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380075/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of non-coherent correlation in DS/BPSK spread spectrum acquisition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4959295","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of non-coherent correlation in DS/BPSK spread spectrum acquisition","sourcePdf":"00380075.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038272S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"19","articleId":"380075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":380077,"authors":[{"name":"R.

However, different multipath profile models can lead to significant differences in predicted system performance, so caution should be exercised when choosing a particular model for analysis. Several previous studies show that a good fit to the experimentally measured multipath profile of indoor wireless channels is an exponential function. Assuming Rayleigh fading and an exponential multipath profile, in this paper we derive a closed form expression for the bit error rate of biphase-shift-keying and an upper bound for trellis-code-modulation both with combined spread-spectrum and antenna diversity. Comparison of these results with simulated results based on actual indoor channel measurements shows that the exponential profile model differs from the simulation model by only 1-2 dB whereas the constant profile model differs by as much as 5 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4959300","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Performance of BPSK and TCM using the exponential multipath profile model for spread-spectrum indoor radio channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of BPSK and TCM using the exponential multipath profile model for spread-spectrum indoor radio channels","sourcePdf":"00380080.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059394S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","articleId":"380080","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":380081,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.H.

The authors present a technique for the compensation of nonlinear distortions in the received signal constellation in an all-digital demodulator for rate-3/4 16-state trellis coded (TC) 16-QAM. They show that, by simple modifications to the metric computer in the Viterbi decoder, the optimum operating point of the amplifier can be moved much closer to saturation than in the conventional case, without any need for on-board amplifier linearization. The simulation results demonstrate a BER of 10/sup -5/ with a power saving of roughly 3.5 dB in a typical nonlinear channel, when compared to conventional uncoded 8-PSK. This figure includes all of the impairments produced by increased satellite amplifier OBO and by the presence of the subsystems for symbol timing recovery, carrier phase estimation and automatic gain control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.380085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380085.pdf","startPage":"659","endPage":"668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and design of an all-digital demodulator for trellis coded 16-QAM transmission over a nonlinear satellite channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=380085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380085/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of an all-digital demodulator for trellis coded 16-QAM transmission over a nonlinear satellite channel","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4959305","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of an all-digital demodulator for trellis coded 16-QAM transmission over a nonlinear satellite channel","sourcePdf":"00380085.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03527S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"34","articleId":"380085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":380087,"authors":[{"name":"J.N.

A hierarchical decomposition divides the task of equalising a high-order QAM channel into much simpler sub-tasks.

The constant modulus algorithm (CMA) is used as a benchmark to assess this multi-stage blind equaliser. It is demonstrated that the new blind algorithm achieves much faster convergence and is very robust when input symbols are not sufficiently white.

This new scheme uses two stages of adaptive coding: the inner code is a rate compatible binary block code which due to its short blocklength can be maximum likelihood decoded taking into account soft-decisions and channel state information. For retransmissions code combining can be used. The outer code is a Reed-Solomon code which is maximum-distance separable and can correct error bursts as well as erasures indicated by the inner decoder. No interleaving is necessary and no critical optimization of system parameters is required to adapt to different channels and signal-to-noise ratios. In the paper, the scheme is described in detail and its throughput efficiency is analyzed. Also, simulation results for the throughput in the Gaussian and in the Rayleigh channel are presented. It is shown that the proposed error control scheme offers excellent throughput performance. Compared to other schemes, the new scheme maintains its efficiency over a very broad range of signal-to-noise ratios.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concatenated codes","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Error correction","Signal to noise ratio","Throughput","Automatic repeat request","Maximum likelihood decoding","Fading","Adaptive coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","error correction codes","concatenated codes","adaptive codes","fading","time-varying channels","block codes","Reed-Solomon codes","maximum likelihood decoding","Gaussian channels","Rayleigh channels","mobile communication","data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated two-stage adaptive error control scheme","data transmission","time-varying channels","automatic repeat request","severely fading channels","signal-to-noise ratios","adaptive coding","inner code","rate compatible binary block code","throughput performance","maximum likelihood decoding","soft-decisions","channel state information","retransmissions","code combining","outer code","Reed-Solomon code","maximum-distance separable","error bursts correction","efficiency","Rayleigh channel","Gaussian channel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=380111","doi":"10.1109/26.380111","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380111.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380111","startPage":"795","endPage":"803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A concatenated two-stage adaptive (CTSA) error control scheme for data transmission in time-varying channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A concatenated two-stage adaptive (CTSA) error control scheme for data transmission in time-varying channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4964110","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A concatenated two-stage adaptive (CTSA) error control scheme for data transmission in time-varying channels","sourcePdf":"00380111.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081854S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","articleId":"380111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":380112,"authors":[{"name":"L.C.

The problem is found to be NP-hard, and an effective, heuristic, polynomial-time algorithm is presented for computing approximate solutions. The minimax criterion yields greatly improved worst case performance while maintaining good average performance. In addition, the familiar MSE criterion is shown likewise to yield an NP-hard index assignment task.

For such systems, it is known that the spectral support of the optimum transmitter is not, in general, restricted to a Nyquist set, in contrast to the case for the additive-noise channel. Nevertheless, the problem of determining the optimum transmitter shaping function for the crosstalk channel without the Nyquist restriction is a difficult one, and has so far remained unsolved. Motivated by current interest in the high-speed digital subscriber line (HDSL) and related crosstalk-dominated applications, we explore a subcase of this problem in which only a single interferer is present. When applied to HDSL-like systems with a single (or dominant) interferer, our analysis and numerical results confirm that wider-than-Nyquist transmitters provide a large performance advantage over Nyquist-limited transmitters. Several interesting and counter-intuitive results also arise. For example, PAM and QAM systems operating at the same spectral efficiency do not, in general, perform identically over the crosstalk channel, despite their essential equivalence in additive noise. We explain why this is so, and show that for channels qualitatively similar to the HDSL wire-pair, QAM has a significant advantage over PAM at high data rates. Finally, we show how the characteristics of HDSL-like channels can be exploited by optimizing the symbol rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380116.pdf","startPage":"837","endPage":"850","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.380116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=380116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmitter design for data transmission in the presence of a data-like interferer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Data communication","Crosstalk","Additive noise","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Digital communication","DSL","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmitters","subscriber loops","crosstalk","telecommunication channels","twisted pair cables","data communication","digital communication","pulse amplitude modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data transmission","data-like interferer","digital communications systems","transmitter design","channel impairment","optimum transmitter shaping function","crosstalk channel","high-speed digital subscriber line","wider-than-Nyquist transmitters","Nyquist-limited transmitters","PAM","QAM","spectral efficiency","additive noise","HDSL wire-pair","high data rates","HDSL-like channels","symbol rate optimisation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","displayDocTitle":"Transmitter design for data transmission in the presence of a data-like interferer","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4964115","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmitter design for data transmission in the presence of a data-like interferer","sourcePdf":"00380116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040993S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"32","articleId":"380116","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":380118,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In the analysis of a DFE, a common assumption is that the receiver has perfect knowledge of the channel impulse response. However, this is not the case in practice, and for a rapidly fading channel, errors in channel tracking can become significant. We analyze theoretically the impact of these errors on the performance of a multichannel DFE. The expressions obtained for the achievable average MPSK bit error probabilities depend on the estimation error covariance. In order to specify this matrix, we focus on a special case when a Kalman filter is used as an optimal channel estimator. In this case, the probability of bit error can be assessed directly in terms of channel fading model parameters, the most interesting of which is the fading rate.

An empirical justification for this procedure is that it generally causes the signal-to-noise ratio to increase. Recently, very accurate models of impulsive noise were presented, based on the theory of symmetric /spl alpha/-stable probability density functions. We examine the performance of optimum receivers, designed to detect signals embedded in impulsive noise which is modeled as an infinite variance symmetric /spl alpha/-stable process, and compare it against the performance of several suboptimum receivers. As a measure of receiver performance, we compute an asymptotic expression for the probability of error for each receiver and compare it to the probability of error calculated by extensive Monte-Carlo simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.380123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380123","startPage":"904","endPage":"914","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380123.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of optimum and suboptimum receivers in the presence of impulsive noise modeled as an alpha-stable process","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380123/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","displayDocTitle":"Performance of optimum and suboptimum receivers in the presence of impulsive noise modeled as an alpha-stable process","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4964122","publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of optimum and suboptimum receivers in the presence of impulsive noise modeled as an alpha-stable process","sourcePdf":"00380123.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058337S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"188","articleId":"380123","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":380126,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An accurate method based on saddle point approximation is used. Previous work using saddle point approximation considered only basic integration-and-dump detection. The use of equalizers other than integration-and-dump complicates the computation because of the complexity of the moment generating function involved. When ISI is strong, use of an equalizer such as raised-cosine filtering is important for ISI reduction. To help optical receiver design, this paper explains the use of saddle point approximation when an equalizer is used. In addition to integration-and-dump, cosine and raised-cosine equalizers are considered for ISI reduction. To study the interdependence between the received waveform and equalizer used, two different input pulses are also considered. To verify the computation accuracy, exact contour integration based on the numerical quadrature method is performed. Results show that saddle point approximation can provide a fast and accurate computation. From the bit error rate (BER) performance computed, it is found that the traditional use of matched filtering has a poor performance when either ISI is strong or the APD gain is large, and the use of a proper equalizer can significantly improve the performance. In other words, the best choice of an equalizer design depends on the input waveform, amount of ISI, and the APD gain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380131.pdf","startPage":"989","endPage":"1000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.380131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=380131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saddle point bit error rate computations for optical communication systems incorporating equalizers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Optical computing","Optical fiber communication","Equalizers","Intersymbol interference","Filtering","Optical noise","Optical filters","Optical receivers","Optical design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","optical noise","intersymbol interference","computational complexity","optical receivers","integration","matched filters","optical fibre communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["saddle point bit error rate computations","optical communication systems","equalizers","noise","intersymbol interference","moment generating function","computational complexity","raised-cosine filtering","ISI reduction","optical receiver design","integration-and-dump equalizer","raised-cosine equalizer","cosine equalizer","input pulses","exact contour integration","numerical quadrature method","matched filtering","APD gain","input waveform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380131/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","displayDocTitle":"Saddle point bit error rate computations for optical communication systems incorporating equalizers","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4964130","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saddle point bit error rate computations for optical communication systems incorporating equalizers","sourcePdf":"00380131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040729S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","articleId":"380131","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":380142,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

The resulting simulation density consists of a sum of exponentially twisted distributions. For the additive Gaussian channel, this simulation density is equivalent to the conventional (mean-shift) noise biasing IS method, but with the bias vector chosen from a fixed set in a random manner. In order to properly select the bias vectors, the asymptotic decision boundary of the Bayesian equalizer is first determined. It is shown that the boundary is formed by multiple hyperplanes, and that the appropriate bias vectors are orthogonal to the hyperplanes. The simulation technique is then extended to the recursive symbol-by-symbol detector of Abend and Fritchman (A-F algorithm) proposed in 1970, and simulation results are presented for both recursive and non-recursive equalizers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Equalizers","Bayesian methods","Additive noise","Gaussian channels","Gaussian noise","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","equalisers","signal sampling","random processes","exponential distribution","signal detection","intersymbol interference","Gaussian channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["importance sampling simulation","Bayesian equalizers","large deviations theory","simulation density","exponentially twisted distributions","additive Gaussian channel","mean-shift noise biasing","bias vector","asymptotic decision boundary","multiple hyperplanes","recursive symbol-by-symbol detector","A-F algorithm","simulation results","non-recursive equalizers","recursive equalizers","randomized bias technique","intersymbol interference channels"]}],"doi":"10.1109/26.380142","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380142.pdf","startPage":"1107","endPage":"1115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A randomized bias technique for the importance sampling simulation of Bayesian equalizers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=380142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A randomized bias technique for the importance sampling simulation of Bayesian equalizers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380142/","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4964141","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A randomized bias technique for the importance sampling simulation of Bayesian equalizers","sourcePdf":"00380142.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053986S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","articleId":"380142","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":380145,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Finally, the impact of the algorithm on the receiver BER is briefly analyzed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380149","doi":"10.1109/26.380149","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380149.pdf","startPage":"1169","endPage":"1178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier frequency recovery in all-digital modems for burst-mode transmissions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Carrier frequency recovery in all-digital modems for burst-mode transmissions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4964148","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier frequency recovery in all-digital modems for burst-mode transmissions","sourcePdf":"00380149.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031726S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"278","articleId":"380149","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":380157,"authors":[{"name":"H.A.

The fading model is a nonfrequency selective Rayleigh fading with a first-order low pass spectrum for the quadrature fading components. The analytical methods are complemented by simulations. The influence of the fading bandwidth on the packet error rate and the packet throughput is discussed. Block codes as well as convolutional codes are considered. The results show that without forward error correction the throughput for slow fading is higher than for fast fading. With forward error correction the packet error rate is sensitive to the fading bandwidth. Furthermore it is shown that the convolutional code with intra packet interleaving is least sensitive to slow fading.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4964185","displayDocTitle":"Packet error rate in the non-interleaved Rayleigh channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet error rate in the non-interleaved Rayleigh channel","sourcePdf":"00380184.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03807S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"59","articleId":"380184","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":380185,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The ICA is a specific form of partitioning the trellis diagram of the encoder using its inherent symmetries and permits the optimal down scaling of the design to the point where a single-chip VD is feasible. The effectiveness of the ICA is demonstrated by obtaining better than linear tradeoff between throughput and complexity for a wide range of complexity reduction factors. The existence of isomorphic topologies for the VDs associated with encoders having different memories derived through the application of the ICA permits the design of programmable decoders. Programmable decoders in turn can be used in a portable communication environment to provide power control for the portable transceiver depending on the channel state and the required data rate. The feasibility of the design of single-chip VDs leads to a significant power saving in comparison to the multi-chip design option.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.380191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380191","endPage":"1418","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380191.pdf","startPage":"1409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The iterative collapse algorithm: a novel approach for the design of long constraint length Viterbi decoders.

In a typical cellular radio application, the performance-limiting impairment is interference due to synchronous data streams from other co-channel and adjacent channel users (CCI and ACI). The receiver under consideration employs an adaptive fractionally spaced decision feedback equalizer (DFE) Which exploits the correlation of the cyclostationary interference to achieve superior performance relative to the worst case when the interference is stationary noise. The paper presents ideal calculations which confirm that significant DFE performance gains are potentially achievable by explicitly accounting for the cyclostationary CCI. Two adaptive DFE strategies are considered. One approach is to adapt the DFE directly using iterative algorithms such as least mean square (LMS) or recursive least squares (RLS). Another approach is to compute the minimum mean square error DFE using an RLS channel impulse response (CIR) estimate and a sample estimate of the CCI autocorrelation obtained from the CIR estimation error during training. The best approach for adaptive equalization, in terms of adaptation speed and system performance, is to employ an RLS DFE which does not explicitly estimate the CIR or the CCI autocorrelation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.380194","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380194.pdf","startPage":"1441","endPage":"1453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive equalization for co-channel interference in a multipath fading environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=380194","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380194/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive equalization for co-channel interference in a multipath fading environment","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4964192","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive equalization for co-channel interference in a multipath fading environment","sourcePdf":"00380194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043633S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"46","articleId":"380194","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":380195,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

A signal received on a fading channel is subject to a multiplicative distortion (MD) and to the usual additive noise. Following a compensation of the MD, the signal provided to the detector may be thought to include only a single additive distortion term (\"final noise\"), which comprises the effects of the original additive noise, the MD, and the error in MD compensation. An exact expression for the probability density function of the final noise is derived. This allows calculation of error probability for arbitrary types of linear modulations. Results for many cases of interest are presented. Furthermore, as special cases of Ricean fading, error probability for Rayleigh fading and non-fading channels are obtained which either match the results or complete the approximate derivations formerly known from the literature.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the error probability of linearly modulated signals on frequency-flat Ricean, Rayleigh, and AWGN channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.380195","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380195.pdf","startPage":"1454","endPage":"1466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=380195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380195/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","displayDocTitle":"On the error probability of linearly modulated signals on frequency-flat Ricean, Rayleigh, and AWGN channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4964193","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the error probability of linearly modulated signals on frequency-flat Ricean, Rayleigh, and AWGN channels","sourcePdf":"00380195.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041466S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"77","articleId":"380195","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":380198,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Liu","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Kingston, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Yong Liu","id":"37350329600"},{"name":"S.D.

This algorithm combines decision feedback and adaptive linear prediction (DFALP) by using tentative coherent detection and the least mean square (LMS) algorithm. Both simulation results and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the performance of this algorithm compares favorably with the SADD algorithm in terms of decision delay, mean-square error and bit-error-rate.

QFPM results when two NFSK/2PSK (combined frequency and phase shift keying) signals are quadrature-carrier multiplexed. The power efficiency of QFPM and CP QFPM on the AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise) channel is always superior when compared to that of quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM), and their bandwidth efficiency is demonstrated to be under certain conditions comparable or better than that of QAM.

Data modulation is carried out by binary phase shift keying and direct sequence spread spectrum signaling. The micro-cellular communication media is modeled as a frequency selective fading channel with multipath propagation. The multipath diversity of the received signals from the K users is exploited by a bank of K RAKE correlators. Algorithms based on the maximum likelihood rule have been developed for estimating the complex channel coefficients as well as for detection of the desired data packets from the sufficient statistics provided by the RAKE correlators. The performance of the resulting multiuser detector is evaluated analytically and via Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate that the estimator of the channel coefficients has a variance close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound, and that the proposed multiuser detector is capable of eliminating the near-far effect as well as processing the signals propagated through multiple paths.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380205.pdf","startPage":"1556","endPage":"1565","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.380205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=380205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiuser receiver for code division multiple access communications over multipath channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Correlators","Maximum likelihood detection","Detectors","Phase modulation","Binary phase shift keying","Spread spectrum communication","Frequency","Fading","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","multipath channels","radio receivers","phase shift keying","fading","correlators","maximum likelihood estimation","maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access communications","multipath channel","multiuser receiver","multiuser communication system","multipath propagation","data modulation","binary phase shift keying","direct sequence spread spectrum signaling","micro-cellular communication media","frequency selective fading channel","multipath diversity","received signals","RAKE correlators","maximum likelihood rule","channel coefficients","data packets detection","statistics","multiuser detector","Monte Carlo simulations","Cramer-Rao lower bound","near-far effect","signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","displayDocTitle":"A multiuser receiver for code division multiple access communications over multipath channels","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4964203","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiuser receiver for code division multiple access communications over multipath channels","sourcePdf":"00380205.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088627S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"95","articleId":"380205","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":380206,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Performing extensive statistical and graphical tests, our main conclusion is that long-range dependence is an inherent feature of VBR video traffic, i.e., a feature that is independent of scene (e.g., video phone, video conference, motion picture video) and codec. In particular, we show that the long-range dependence property allows us to clearly distinguish between our measured data and traffic generated by VBR source models currently used in the literature. These findings give rise to novel and challenging problems in traffic engineering for high-speed networks and open up new areas of research in queueing and performance analysis involving long-range dependent traffic models. A small number of analytic queueing results already exist, and we discuss their implications for network design and network control strategies in the presence of long-range dependent traffic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4964204","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Long-range dependence in variable-bit-rate video traffic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-range dependence in variable-bit-rate video traffic","sourcePdf":"00380206.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052746S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"817","articleId":"380206","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":380208,"authors":[{"name":"S.

At several locations in each of five different rooms, we have studied line-of-sight and diffuse link configurations, with and without shadowing, amounting to a total of approximately 100 different channels. We have measured channel frequency responses over the 2-300 MHz range by using a swept-modulation frequency technique, and from these data, we have computed channel impulse responses, path losses and r.m.s. delay spreads. Using channel impulse responses, we have calculated power penalties induced by multipath intersymbol interference in baseband on-off-keyed links operating at bit rates of 10, 30 and 100 Mb/s, considering unequalized links and those employing zero-forcing decision-feedback equalization. Unshadowed line-of-sight configurations generally have smaller path losses, r.m.s. delay spreads and power penalties than their unshadowed diffuse counterparts. Shadowed line-of-sight configurations, however, generally exhibit larger values of all three parameters than the corresponding shadowed diffuse configurations. We show that among the channels measured here, there is a strong correspondence between channel r.m.s. delay spread and multipath power penalty. Finally, we provide an analysis indicating why non-directed infrared channels using intensity modulation and direct detection do not exhibit multipath fading, and justifying their representation as linear, time-invariant systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380210.pdf","doi":"10.1109/26.380210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380210","startPage":"1613","endPage":"1623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental characterization of non-directed indoor infrared channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380210/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental characterization of non-directed indoor infrared channels","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","accessionNumber":"4964208","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental characterization of non-directed indoor infrared channels","sourcePdf":"00380210.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082289S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"208","articleId":"380210","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":380212,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

The discrepancy in CIR between this model and the small signal model commonly used in the literature is important at high modulation indices (4.5 dB at about unity modulation index). This justifies the introduction of the large signal model for analyzing OBI.

This method is named QPR-TCM. Whereas previous contributions have considered the performance of TCM transmitted over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, the emphasis in this paper is on the performance of trellis coded M-ary QAM combined with PRS in the fading environment. We only consider the case where interleaving/deinterleaving is employed to further combat the fading and assume that the ideal channel state information (CSI) is available. Analytical upper bounds are derived using the well known transfer function bounding technique, the bandwidth efficiencies are computed and the numerical results for several practical schemes are compared to each other. One interesting result is that when the combined system is used on a Rician fading channel, the bit error probability upper bounds of the proposed 6QPR-TCM and 9QPR-TCM systems are better than their counterparts the 4QAM-TCM systems with 2 and 4 states, respectively, for SNR values greater than a threshold, which have the best error performances in the literature.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.380214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380214","endPage":"1662","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380214.pdf","startPage":"1653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error performance analysis of quadrature partial response trellis coded modulation (QPR-TCM) in fading mobile satellite channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380214/","displayDocTitle":"Error performance analysis of quadrature partial response trellis coded modulation (QPR-TCM) in fading mobile satellite channels","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","accessionNumber":"4964212","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error performance analysis of quadrature partial response trellis coded modulation (QPR-TCM) in fading mobile satellite channels","sourcePdf":"00380214.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040062S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","articleId":"380214","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":380216,"authors":[{"name":"Haibo Li","affiliation":["Image Coding Group, The Department of Electrical Engineering, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"lastName":"Haibo Li","id":"37367696000"},{"name":"R.

Such SS signals would be constrained in power so as not to interfere with pre-existing, narrowband users. In view of this application, suppression of strong narrowband signals that interfere with commercial SS communications systems is being investigated with renewed interest. Previous research has modeled narrowband users as sinusoidal or autoregressive signals, and consequently has advocated use of predictive altering to suppress such signals. In the present paper it is shown that when the narrowband interferer is in fact a digital communications signal these methods are less effective than techniques derived from multiuser communications. In particular, by modeling a narrowband user as a digital signal, optimal and asymptotically (low background noise) optimal linear algorithms for the recovery of the SS bit stream are developed. This technique represents not only a promising new approach to narrowband interference suppression, but also a new application for multiuser detection theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380223.pdf","startPage":"1725","endPage":"1737","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.380223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=380223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser detection techniques for narrowband interference suppression in spread spectrum communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Narrowband","Radio spectrum management","Personal communication networks","Spread spectrum communication","Interference constraints","Communication systems","Predictive models","Power system modeling","Digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","digital communication","personal communication networks","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","signal detection","code division multiple access","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser detection techniques","narrowband interference suppression","spread spectrum communications","personal communications","autoregressive signals","sinusoidal signals","predictive altering","digital communications","multiuser detection theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser detection techniques for narrowband interference suppression in spread spectrum communications","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4964220","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser detection techniques for narrowband interference suppression in spread spectrum communications","sourcePdf":"00380223.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075828S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"35","articleId":"380223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":380225,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.

The focus of the paper is on the multiuser interference rejecting capability of the receiver. The receiver uses a chip matched filter followed by an adaptive equalizer structure to perform the despreading operation. This adaptive structure allows the receiver to adjust to the prevailing interference and noise environment. An analysis of the receiver giving the form of the equalizer coefficients and the mean squared error in steady state is given. From these results the capacity of a CDMA network using this receiver structure is obtained and compared with a system using conventional receivers. The receiver is shown to be immune to the near-far problem in the sense that the performance without any power control is nearly identical to the performance with perfect power control. The receiver is also shown to offer a two-fold increase in capacity relative to a conventional receiver with perfect power control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.380225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380225.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","startPage":"1746","endPage":"1755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive direct-sequence code-division multiple-access receiver for multiuser interference rejection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=380225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive direct-sequence code-division multiple-access receiver for multiuser interference rejection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380225/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4964222","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive direct-sequence code-division multiple-access receiver for multiuser interference rejection","sourcePdf":"00380225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041343S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"344","articleId":"380225","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":380227,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

The partial selection problem occurs when dealing with non-exhaustive multi-path breadth-first searches, like in the M algorithm or the bidirectional algorithm. These algorithms are used in the decoding of convolutional codes. The paper presents a set of bounds to evaluate the quality of regular, Delta class, networks of depth 1gN and width N/2, with respect to their selection capabilities. The results from the bounds are compared to Monte Carlo simulations of the selection capabilities of the Banyan and Alekseyev networks.

A basic component in such loops is the frequency difference detector (FDD). This paper concentrates on a class of FDDs for use with binary continuous-phase modulation (CPM). Their derivation is based on two ideas: the maximum-likelihood principle for parameter estimation and Laurent's (1986) decomposition of a CPM signal into the sum of linearly modulated components. The proposed FDDs are suitable for digital implementation and their operation is independent of clock recovery. Analysis and simulation are employed to investigate tracking operation and acquisition capability of frequency control loops endowed with such FDDs. Numerical examples are provided for modulation schemes of practical interest such as MSK and Gaussian MSK. The loop acquisition range is found to be fairly large, about 0.5-1.0 times the bit rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380234.pdf","startPage":"1828","endPage":"1837","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.380234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=380234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency detectors for CPM signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Signal detection","Frequency locked loops","Tracking loops","Digital control","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Parameter estimation","Clocks","Independent component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency control","signal detection","continuous phase modulation","maximum likelihood estimation","tracking","digital communication","minimum shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CPM signals","frequency detectors","frequency tracking loops","digital links","carrier frequency control","frequency difference detector","binary continuous-phase modulation","maximum-likelihood principle","parameter estimation","Laurent's decomposition","CPM signal","linearly modulated components","clock recovery","simulation","tracking operation","acquisition","frequency control loops","MSK","Gaussian MSK","loop acquisition range","bit rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","displayDocTitle":"Frequency detectors for CPM signals","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4964231","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency detectors for CPM signals","sourcePdf":"00380234.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041282S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"38","articleId":"380234","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":380235,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Since the loss of data is mainly due to traffic congestion, and the minimum unit of loss is a cell which may contain multiple DPCM codewords, the loss process can be highly correlated. The contribution of this work comes in two parts. We first give a formulation which relates the performance of DPCM, in terms of signal-to-reconstruction-noise ratio, to the channel loss conditions. In particular we take into account any correlation that exists in the loss process. We then study in detail mechanisms which give rise to such correlation. Using simple source and multiplexing models, formulae are given which characterise the loss process as a result of statistical multiplexing. As a direct result of this treatment, we know that the maximum achievable performance of DPCM with reoptimised predictors further deteriorates when the loss process is correlated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/8633/00380240.pdf","startPage":"1686","endPage":"1696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380240","doi":"10.1109/26.380240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The performance of DPCM operating on lossy channels with memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb./March/April  1995","displayDocTitle":"The performance of DPCM operating on lossy channels with memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380240/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb./March/April 1995","accessionNumber":"4964216","volume":"43","issue":"2/3/4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The performance of DPCM operating on lossy channels with memory","sourcePdf":"00380240.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072124S","chronDate":"Feb./March/April  1995","isNumber":"8633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","articleId":"380240","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":380243,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

However, the performance of this detector is sensitive to signal shifts and mismatch between the assumed and the actual structure of the received signal. As such, the use of a matched filter detector in a multipath environment can result in substantially poorer performance than expected. Here, it is shown that the use of the incoherent (or sliding) matched filter can also result in a substantial performance loss if the signal autocorrelation function is narrow relative to the interarrival times of the pulses. In contrast, a detector that compares the zero-zero lag of the matched filter cumulant sequence to a threshold has a performance that is relatively insensitive to multipath channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","volume":"20","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4882734","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of the incoherent and skewness matched filter detectors in multipath environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of the incoherent and skewness matched filter detectors in multipath environments","sourcePdf":"00380243.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046236S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"10","articleId":"380243","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":380244,"authors":[{"name":"Shaolin Li","affiliation":["Computational Neurobiology Laboratory, Salk Institute, San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Shaolin Li","id":"37384177100"},{"name":"T.J.

The problem of separating a mixture of several independent signals in free-field conditions or a signal and echoes in confined spaces is compounded by propagation time delays between the source(s) and the microphones because the conventional Herault-Jutten network cannot tolerate time delays. In this paper, we combine a symmetrically balanced beamforming array with the conventional Herault-Jutten network. The resulting system can adaptively separate signals that include delays introduced by the propagation medium. The proposed algorithm has been simulated in digital communication multipath channels where intersymbol interference exists. The simulation results show two clear advantages of the proposed method over the conventional adaptive equalization: (1) there is no penalty for very long impulse responses caused by long delays, and (2) no training signals are needed for equalization. The design of a multibeamformer to handle the source separation of multiple broad-band signals is also presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380244/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4882733","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive separation of mixed broadband sound sources with delays by a beamforming Herault-Jutten network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive separation of mixed broadband sound sources with delays by a beamforming Herault-Jutten network","sourcePdf":"00380244.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037755S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"23","articleId":"380244","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":380245,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

Such systems usually have a gyrocompass as a single sensory input. Modern sea going vessels have a range of navigation aids most of which may be interconnected to form integrated systems. It is possible to employ the navigational data to provide best estimates of state vectors (Kalman filter) and optimal guidance strategies. Such techniques require powerful computing facilities, particularly if the dynamic characteristics of the vessel are changing, as may be the case in a maneuvering situation or changes in forward speed. This paper investigates the possibility of training a neural network to behave in the same manner as an optimal ship guidance system, the objective being to provide a system that can adapt its parameters so that it provides optimal performance over a range of conditions, without incurring a large computational penalty. A series of simulation studies have been undertaken to compare the performance of a trained neural network with that of the original optimal guidance system over a range of forward speeds. It is demonstrated that a single network has comparable performance to a set of optimal guidance control laws, each computed for different forward speeds.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/48.380245","startPage":"65","endPage":"72","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/8634/00380245.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.380245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The use of artificial neural networks for the intelligent optimal control of surface ships","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Artificial intelligence","Intelligent networks","Marine vehicles","Navigation","Neural networks","Computer networks","Intelligent sensors","Three-term control","PD control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal control","ships","navigation","state estimation","Kalman filters","neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","digital simulation","intelligent control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural networks","intelligent optimal control","surface ships","autopilots","PID control algorithms","fixed heading","course-changing","course-keeping","gyrocompass","sea going vessels","navigation aids","navigational data","state vectors","Kalman filter","optimal guidance strategies","dynamic characteristics","maneuvering situation","neural network","optimal ship guidance","simulation","optimal guidance control laws"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380245/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"The use of artificial neural networks for the intelligent optimal control of surface ships","volume":"20","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4882732","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The use of artificial neural networks for the intelligent optimal control of surface ships","sourcePdf":"00380245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.279027S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"66","articleId":"380245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":380413,"authors":[{"name":"M.

SETM is simple, fast and stable over the range of parameter values. The major contribution of this paper is that it shows that at least some aspects of data mining can be carried out by using general query languages such as SQL, rather than by developing specialized black-box algorithms. The set-oriented nature of SETM facilitates the development of extensions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8637","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/3041/8637/00380413.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.1995.380413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.1995.380413","startPage":"25","endPage":"33","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Set-oriented mining for association rules in relational databases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380413/","displayDocTitle":"Set-oriented mining for association rules in relational databases","conferenceDate":"6-10 March 1995","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4886438","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Set-oriented mining for association rules in relational databases","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00380413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047628S","chronDate":"6-10 Mar 1995","isNumber":"8637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3041","citationCount":"90","articleId":"380413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":380415,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Many of these approaches represent transformations as affine mappings from the original iteration space to a new iteration space. These approaches show a great deal of promise, but they all rely on the ability to generate code that iterates over the points in these new iteration spaces in the appropriate order. This problem has been fairly well-studied in the case where all statements use the same mapping. We have developed an algorithm for the less well-studied case where each statement uses a potentially different mapping. Unlike many other approaches, our algorithm can also generate code from mappings corresponding to loop blocking. We address the important trade-off between reducing control overhead and duplicating code.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FMPC.1995.380437","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Frontiers '95.

This requirement can be met by using high power or applying linearization techniques. Several methods like the emitter-coupled pair with emitter degeneration, the linearized cross-quad circuit and the concept of employing plurality of emitter-coupled pairs have been proposed to reduce the nonlinearity of the emitter-coupled pair. But they have been mainly characterized by their total harmonic distortion for audio applications. For RF-applications the l-dB gain compression point and the third-order intercept point are widely used. The authors consider that none of these figures of merit is appropriate to compare the performance of various linearization techniques. They define a signal-to-intermodulation ratio taking into account intermodulation products up to the 7th-order. This ratio is a much more significant parameter representing the circuit performance. They present the intermodulation behaviour of three linearization concepts compared with that of the conventional emitter-coupled pair.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380846/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Apr 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4880966","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of linearization techniques for differential amplifiers in integrated circuit design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of linearization techniques for differential amplifiers in integrated circuit design","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"00380846.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023581S","chronDate":"12-14 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3046","citationCount":"5","articleId":"380846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":380868,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In order to overcome the degrading effect introduced by the channel, conventional equalizers, based in digital filters, have been traditionally used. In this paper a new approach based on neural networks is considered. In particular the behavior of multilayer perceptron (MLP) structures applied to the channel equalization of cellular radio indoor environments for 4-QAM modulation is analyzed. In this case the system performance becomes limited by the co-channel interference rather than by the noise and, again, the equalization techniques based on MLP structures may be an effective tool in order to fight this degradation effect.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MELCON.1994.380868","startPage":"1139","endPage":"1142 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MELECON '94.

The fuzzy logic controller utilizes rules obtained from human expertise or input-output mapping of the controlled plant. The inputs to the fuzzy logic controller are the linguistic variable of speed error and change of speed error, while the output is change in switching control frequency of the voltage source inverter. The input voltage to the induction motor is determined from switching control frequency using constant voltage per hertz ratio (V/F) to ensure motor constant flux and maximum available torque per amp. The speed control utilizes a fuzzy logic based controller. Both digital simulation and laboratory test results for speed control of the induction motor drive are presented. Also a comparison between fuzzy logic controller and the traditional PI controller are presented. The results validate the robustness and the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy logic controller for high performance of the induction motor drive.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MELCON.1994.380888","startPage":"1058","endPage":"1061 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MELECON '94.

The ability of the LAV estimators to reject inconsistent measurements is exploited in order to decide whether a circuit breaker is closed or open. The formulation of the LAV state estimation is accordingly modified to include the circuit breaker models and associated constraints. The proposed approach is implemented and tested. Simulation results for single and multiple circuit breaker configurations are given.

Several researchers have suggested that short-term load forecasting (STLF) is a suitable area for the implementation of the NN approach. This paper presents work to further support two previous reports in which the authors described a method developed using NN and proposed a novel approach in applying NN to the problem of STLF. The proposed approaches to STLF have been developed for the PC environment as the primary target. With the increase in power and performance of networked PCs, such a platform is capable of supporting the large scale databases, high speed communications and processing power, required for the STFL process in the electricity supply industry (ESI). This improved method uses a NN architecture which consists of an ensemble of hidden layers, connected separately to a common input and output layer. The previously reported approaches are improved upon and enhanced to provide 3 hour ahead half hourly forecast together with a sliding window of validated system demand data applied directly to the input layer of the NN. The network includes a data filter that has been developed to remove the generalised noise from the input data set, which is used as an additional input for the NN. Results from annual demand curves with the corresponding forecasts for comparative purposes, which show that the NN approach achieves a high degree of accuracy, comparable with values reported in the literature for STLF, are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/380955/","accessionNumber":"4874949","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-14 April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Short term electric load forecast using artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short term electric load forecast using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"00380955.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038441S","chronDate":"12-14 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3046","citationCount":"2","articleId":"380955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":380979,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This yields very strong nonlinearities, which makes it very difficult to derive a comprehensive mathematical model for the behaviour of the machine. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used to overcome such problems. This paper presents ANNs as a new tool to handle one of the key problems in an SRM based drive system. A back propagation algorithm is used to train the network. To explore the validity of the proposed technique, the results of ANNs were compared with the experimentally measured results. The comparison between these results have validated the applicability of the proposed method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MELCON.1994.380979","pdfPath":"/iel2/3046/8642/00380979.pdf","startPage":"809","endPage":"812 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MELECON '94.

This structure has been designed using a two-phase dynamic logic, based on the massive use of transmission gates and inverters. It has been synthesized using eight macrocells, of three different types, and these, on their turn, are composed of five basic cells. The productivity of the design is high, as the complete structure is composed by 1556 transistor gates, of which only 26 have been physically designed. The resulting lay-out is rather compact, occupying around 1050/spl times/1150 pm in a SP-DM CMOS process of 1.5 /spl mu/m. It implements a non-overlapping bit-recoding algorithm, and may be used both in pipelined and non-pipelined modes. According to timing estimations, it could operate with clock frequencies up to 50 MHz. The application for which it is intended is the design of an Inner Product Processor for the support of Neural Network Algorithms in the Phonetic Encoding of Speech.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MELCON.1994.381099","startPage":"258","endPage":"261 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MELECON '94.

The proposed solution applies non-linear theories (Lyapunov direct method) to adaptive filtering in order to improve the linearity of the RF amplifiers. The obtained design requires lower circuit complexity than the LINC amplifier, and is not based on iterative algorithms nor sub-system identification. Up to 100 MHz these functions could be implemented, at present, with operational amplifiers and integrated analog multipliers (four quadrants). The adjusting algorithm convergence or the interruption of the communication are not problems in the proposed adaptive solution. The canceller structure design is based on model reference adaptive systems (MRAS): to cancel the error between the plant output (distortion output of the RF amplifier) and reference model (the desired signal obtained from a linear and low-power amplifier) by using continuous-time techniques. The proposed structure is studied by computer simulation (SPICE program) in a class-A RF power amplifier, The behaviour of the adapted amplifier is studied when power transistors approach nonlinear operating zones (saturation state).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Apr 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4874108","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Continuous-time adaptive control applied to RF amplifier linearization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous-time adaptive control applied to RF amplifier linearization","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"00381119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027193S","chronDate":"12-14 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3046","articleId":"381119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":381127,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Various conventional techniques have already been well investigated and presented in the literature. However, in the last few years, a lot of attention has been given to adaptive methods based on artificial neural networks, which can significantly improve the symptom interpretation and system performance in a case of malfunctioning. Such methods are especially considered in cases where no explicit algorithms or models for the problem under investigation exist. In such problems, automatic interpretation of faulty symptoms with the use of artificial neural network classifiers is recommended. Two different models of artificial neural networks, the extended backpropagation and the radial basis function, are discussed and applied with appropriate simulations for a real world applications in a chemical manufacturing plant.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381206/","accessionNumber":"4911538","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fault diagnosis in complex systems using artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault diagnosis in complex systems using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00381206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03813S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug 1994","isNumber":"8643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3047","citationCount":"18","articleId":"381206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":381209,"authors":[{"name":"Fjellstad","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Cybernetics, The Norwegian Institute of Technology, University of Trondheim, Trondheim, Norway"],"lastName":"Fjellstad","id":"37087625749"},{"name":"Fossen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Cybernetics, The Norwegian Institute of Technology, University of Trondheim, Trondheim, Norway"],"lastName":"Fossen","id":"37087624398"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1872-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"381209","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=381209","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater vehicle control","Output feedback","Proportional control","Position control","Nonlinear systems","Lyapunov methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["marine systems","feedback","two-term control","position control","attitude control","nonlinear control systems","Lyapunov methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quaternion feedback regulation","global attitude","attitude set-point control","position control","autonomous underwater vehicles","nonlinear PD-control","Lyapunov function","dynamic model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCA.1994.381209","pdfPath":"/iel2/3047/8643/00381209.pdf","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Control and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Control and Applications","startPage":"857","endPage":"862 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.1994.381209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quaternion feedback regulation of underwater vehicles","abstract":"Position and attitude set-point regulation of autonomous underwater vehicles in 6 degrees of freedom is discussed.

The control objective is to track the maximum available solar power in a photovoltaic array interfaced to an electric utility grid via a line-commutated inverter. The inverse dynamic characteristics of this interface scheme is identified via off-line training using a multi-layer perceptron type neural network. The ANN output is used as the control signal to vary the line-commutated inverter firing control angle, hence track the available maximum solar power. The weights of the ANN are also updated by a novel on-line training algorithm which utilizes the on-line power mismatch error. This ensures on-line maximum solar power tracking.

The introduction of this self-feedback path enables the network to exhibit a dynamic characteristic.

Comparisons are made between identified linear and neural models of a nonlinear boiler-generator simulation, and the potential of using these techniques on a real plant is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCA.1994.381379","startPage":"735","endPage":"740 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Control and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.1994.381379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8643","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Control and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3047/8643/00381379.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling and control of generating units using neural network techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381379/","displayDocTitle":"Modelling and control of generating units using neural network techniques","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4885493","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling and control of generating units using neural network techniques","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00381379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067757S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug 1994","isNumber":"8643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3047","citationCount":"2","articleId":"381379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":381452,"authors":[{"name":"Youlal","affiliation":["Laboratory Leesa Facult\u00e9 des Sciences, Mohammed-V University, Rabat, Morocco"],"lastName":"Youlal","id":"37088011433"},{"name":"Kada","affiliation":["Laboratory Leesa Facult\u00e9 des Sciences, Mohammed-V University, Rabat, Morocco"],"lastName":"Kada","id":"37088007324"},{"name":"Haloua","affiliation":["Laboratory Leesa Facult\u00e9 des Sciences, Mohammed-V University, Rabat, Morocco"],"lastName":"Haloua","id":"37088009251"},{"name":"Majdoul","affiliation":["Laboratory Leesa Facult\u00e9 des Sciences, Mohammed-V University, Rabat, Morocco"],"lastName":"Majdoul","id":"37088011615"},{"name":"Ramzi","affiliation":["Laboratory Leesa Facult\u00e9 des Sciences, Mohammed-V University, Rabat, Morocco"],"lastName":"Ramzi","id":"37088010409"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1872-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"381452","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chemical industry","Feedforward neural networks","Multivariable systems","Nonlinear systems","Backpropagation","Adaptive control","Identification","Intelligent control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distillation","chemical technology","feedforward neural nets","multivariable control systems","nonlinear control systems","backpropagation","adaptive control","identification","intelligent control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward multilayered hidden neural networks","adaptive control","identification","distillation process","nonlinear multivariable systems","dynamic backpropagation","learning system","chemical process control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=381452","abstract":"This paper describes and discusses a multivariable control application of the feedforward multilayered hidden neural networks. First, an identification and control scheme of nonlinear multivariable systems is developed with reference to adaptive control. In this scheme we make use of two multilayered hidden neural networks, both trained with dynamic backpropagation algorithm and assigned respectively the identification and control tasks. The basic theoretical concepts and definitions are introduced throughout the paper. Simulation results reveal that the proposed neural networks control scheme are practically feasible. The sufficiency of the training set for identifying and controlling a nonlinear multivariable distillation process is investigated. The application results show that performances of the proposed control scheme based on the multilayered hidden neural networks are superior to conventional control strategies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCA.1994.381452","startPage":"289","endPage":"294 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Control and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.1994.381452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8643","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Control and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3047/8643/00381452.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilayered neural networks for identification and control of a multivariable distillation process","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381452/","displayDocTitle":"Multilayered neural networks for identification and control of a multivariable distillation process","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4885420","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilayered neural networks for identification and control of a multivariable distillation process","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00381452.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029081S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug 1994","isNumber":"8643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3047","articleId":"381452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":381628,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The models can be easily adapted to match the electrical parameters of real circuit implementations. Generic macromodels for both current mode and voltage mode CNNs are provided. The macromodels not only simulate the conceptual CNN cell, but also provide the capability to model actual CNN architectures and their nonidealities. Moreover, macromodeling provides the capability to determine the effect of parameter variation on the operation of the CNN efficiently without the need for computationally expensive, exhaustive circuit simulations. We have used the CNN macromodels to develop robust testing strategies for detecting faults in VLSI implementations of CNN arrays. Three fault cases are introduced into a CNN array to provide insight to the usefulness of macromodeling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381647/","accessionNumber":"4905728","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A macromodel fault generator for cellular neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A macromodel fault generator for cellular neural networks","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"00381647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064619S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec 1994","isNumber":"8645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3049","citationCount":"1","articleId":"381647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":381648,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The paper is concerned with the physical implementation of a CNN which realizes a specific predefined image processing operation. The circuit is intended to be realized in a 1.2 /spl mu/m CMOS process. The VLSI chip is expected to be used as a smart sensor of visual information and its main function is to detect objects with an area which exceeds some user-defined threshold value. For proper operation the circuit should provide an appropriate image preprocessing to cancel the effects of non-uniform image illumination and to suppress image noise. The kernel of the proposed circuit is a reprogrammable CNN, based on the concept of a pulse-mode CNN. The paper presents an architecture of a basic element of the circuit-a reprogrammable cell, designed using the current-mode approach. The proposed cell architecture differs from the solutions presented so far since it is optimized to ensure these processing properties, which are important for proper circuit operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3049/8645/00381652.pdf","startPage":"351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.1994.381652","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.1994.381652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS current-mode VLSI implementation of cellular neural network for an image objects area estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS current-mode VLSI implementation of cellular neural network for an image objects area estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381652/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4905723","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS current-mode VLSI implementation of cellular neural network for an image objects area estimation","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"00381652.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05129S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 1994","isNumber":"8645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3049","articleId":"381652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":381653,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We study the phenomena of local diffusion and global propagation in a one-dimensional CNN described by the space-invariant A-template A = [A/sub -1/ A/sub 0/ A/sub 1/]. Roughly speaking, a CNN behaves in a local diffusion mode when two distant cells do not influence each other if the states of a number r of adjacent cells located between these two cells have reached some value. It behaves in a global propagation mode otherwise, i.e. when one of these two cells can always influence the other one, whatever the value of the state of r adjacent cells located in between these two cells. We can then compute the values of the template parameters for which the CNN has one of these behaviors. The distinction between these two methods of information processing is a radical one that has many practical consequences on: stability; the influence of boundary conditions; the dependence of the number of stable equilibria on the number of cells; the existence of limit cycles; and on the lengths of transients. For example, we can prove that the number of stable equilibria grows exponentially with the number of cells if and only if the CNN has a local diffusion behavior. If it operates in a global propagation mode, this is no longer true, but periodic solutions (one of which can be explicitly computed) are then present for some types of boundary conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.1994.381653","pdfPath":"/iel2/3049/8645/00381653.pdf","startPage":"349","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.1994.381653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approach to local diffusion and global propagation in 1-dim. cellular neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 1994","displayDocTitle":"An approach to local diffusion and global propagation in 1-dim. cellular neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4905722","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to local diffusion and global propagation in 1-dim. cellular neural networks","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"00381653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044059S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 1994","isNumber":"8645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3049","citationCount":"2","articleId":"381653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":381658,"authors":[{"name":"P.P.

Based on an information theory approach, an entropy associated with a given structure of the network was defined as a global descriptor of the system dynamics. Any kind of discrete time neural model with any size is allowed, including CNN's as a particular case. By performing two or one dimensional analysis trough the weights space, some new properties of the opposite-template CNN's were discovered, e.g. the existence of robustness domains which means that small controllable change in weights values implies no change in the network's entropy. Using this software package, robust chaotic networks capable of generating white-noise like signals were also discovered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381662/","accessionNumber":"4905713","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust oscillations and bifurcations in cellular neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust oscillations and bifurcations in cellular neural networks","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"00381662.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032354S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec 1994","isNumber":"8645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3049","citationCount":"6","articleId":"381662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":381663,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Mei Yang","affiliation":["Shanghai University, Shanghai, Shanghai, CN"],"lastName":"Chun-Mei Yang","id":"37087261077"},{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control Engineering, Shanghai University of Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Tao Yang","id":"37087145757"},{"name":"Kan-Yu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control Engineering, Shanghai University of Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Kan-Yu Zhang","id":"37087636508"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2070-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"381663","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=381663","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Intelligent networks","Cellular neural networks","Voltage","Hydrogen","Erbium","Stochastic systems","Fractals","Equations","Sufficient conditions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","bifurcation","cellular neural nets","discrete time systems","nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time cellular neural networks","quasi-period","chaos","DTCNN","2-cell autonomous DTCNN","quasi-periodic motions","periodic motions","3-cell autonomous DTCNN","3-cell nonautonomous DTCNN","strange attractors","bifurcation diagrams","transition procedures","periodic motion","separated branches","nonlinear discrete time dynamical systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CNNA.1994.381663","pdfPath":"/iel2/3049/8645/00381663.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","startPage":"297","endPage":"302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.1994.381663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chaos in the discrete time cellular neural networks","abstract":"The quasi-period and chaos in discrete time cellular neural networks (DTCNN) are studied in this paper.

Cellular neural networks have great potential in solving many important scientific problems in signal processing and optimization by the use of predetermined templates. Hardware annealing (SaHyun Bang, 1994), which is a paralleled version of effective mean field annealing in analog networks, is a highly efficient method of finding optimal solutions for cellular neural networks. It does not require any stochastic procedure and henceforth can be very fast. The generalized energy function of the network is first increased by reducing the voltage gain of each neuron. Then, the hardware annealing searches for the globally minimum energy state by continuously increasing the gain of neurons. The process of global optimization by the proposed hardware annealing method can be described by eigenvalues in the time varying dynamic system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.1994.381666","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3049/8645/00381666.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.1994.381666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal solutions of selected cellular neural network applications by the hardware annealing method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=381666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381666/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal solutions of selected cellular neural network applications by the hardware annealing method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4905709","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal solutions of selected cellular neural network applications by the hardware annealing method","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"00381666.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045349S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec 1994","isNumber":"8645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3049","citationCount":"5","articleId":"381666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":381669,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We discuss the basic linear theory of the CNN including issues of stability and template size.

It is then shown how general deblurring problems can be addressed with a CNN when the blurring operator is known. The proposed application is to solve the basic 3-D confocal image reconstruction task about the form of the blurring operator, confocal behavior in microscope images can be obtained with only 3-5 acquired image planes. In addition, the stored program capability of the CNN Universal Machine would provide integration of several image processing and detection tasks in the same architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3049/8645/00381673.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deblurring of images by cellular neural networks with applications to microscopy","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.1994.381673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.1994.381673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=381673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Deblurring of images by cellular neural networks with applications to microscopy","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4905702","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deblurring of images by cellular neural networks with applications to microscopy","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"00381673.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034738S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec 1994","isNumber":"8645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3049","citationCount":"13","articleId":"381673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":381674,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

Therefore learning is done on a more accurate model of a CMOS cell, and not on the original CNN model proposed by Chua and Yang (1988) and Nossek et al. (1990). This hardware-oriented approach is applied to a current-mode CNN-model based on the full-signal-range model of Rodriguez-Vaazquez et al. (1993) and Espejo (1994), where the dynamic block consists of two current mirrors. It is shown, that a two-quadrant multiplier is sufficient for the multiplication with the template coefficients, by changing the model, further reducing the area consumption. Using a hardware-oriented approach to learning thus not only allows to find template values for a specific VLSI-implementation, but may also lead to further simplifications of CNN-implementations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.1994.381682","startPage":"183","endPage":"188","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3049/8645/00381682.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.1994.381682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-oriented learning for cellular neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular neural networks","Semiconductor device modeling","Mirrors","Circuit synthesis","Hardware","Turing machines","Parasitic capacitance","MOSFET circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","CMOS integrated circuits","multiplying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural networks","hardware-oriented learning","parameter values","nonidealities","CMOS cell","current-mode CNN-model","full-signal-range model","dynamic block","current mirrors","two-quadrant multiplier","multiplication","template coefficients","area consumption","VLSI-implementation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381682/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-oriented learning for cellular neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4905693","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-oriented learning for cellular neural networks","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"00381682.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059777S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec 1994","isNumber":"8645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3049","citationCount":"3","articleId":"381682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":381683,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The proposed algorithm resembles the well-known perceptron learning algorithm and hence is called as recurrent perceptron learning algorithm (RPLA) as applied to a dynamical network, CNN. The RPLA can be described as the following set of rules: (i) increase each feedback template coefficient which defines the connection to a mismatching cell from its neighbor whose steady-state output is same with the mismatching cell's desired output. On the contrary, decrease each feedback template coefficient which defines the connection to a mismatching cell from its neighbor whose steady-state is different from the mismatching cell's desired output. (ii) Change the input template coefficients according to the rule stated in (i) by only replacing the word of \"neighbor\" with \"input\". (iii) Retain the template coefficients unchanged if the actual outputs match the desired outputs. The proposed algorithm RPLA has been applied for training CNNs to perform several image processing tasks such as edge detection, hole filling and corner detection. The performance of the templates obtained for the chosen input-(desired)output training pairs has been tested on a set of images which are different from the input images used in the training phase.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.1994.381688","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3049/8645/00381688.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.1994.381688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8645","startPage":"177","endPage":"182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent perceptron learning algorithm for completely stable cellular neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=381688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Recurrent perceptron learning algorithm for completely stable cellular neural networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381688/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4905692","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent perceptron learning algorithm for completely stable cellular neural networks","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"00381688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024837S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec 1994","isNumber":"8645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3049","citationCount":"19","articleId":"381688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":381689,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Instead of original assumption of constant variances of the statistical parameter distributions, we take variances to be linearly dependent on parameter nominal values, which leads us to construct an iterative process with very fast convergence.

Processing of images with sizes up to 100/spl times/100 pixels in realtime is principally possible. In order to process large images, which are much greater than the physical network, virtual processing is needed, and supported by the hardware. As prototype, a cascadable net of 2/spl times/2 cells is implemented on a chip using the 1.0 /spl mu/ process of ES2.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.1994.381702","startPage":"85","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.1994.381702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8645","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3049/8645/00381702.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realisation of a digital cellular neural network for image processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381702/","displayDocTitle":"Realisation of a digital cellular neural network for image processing","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4905678","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realisation of a digital cellular neural network for image processing","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"00381702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030999S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec 1994","isNumber":"8645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3049","citationCount":"7","articleId":"381702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":381703,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It overcomes some of the characteristics and restrictions inherent in CMOS VLSI technologies, and allows an arbitrarily large continuous-time analog CNN to be built up by modularly connecting CNN chips with a modest number of cells. The template values are step-wise programmable, with values chosen for functionality rather than according to conventional binary weighting. All external input, output and control signals are electrical and digital, so the CNN can be directly connected to a controller The design was carried out in a 1-micron n-well CMOS technology. Each cell occupies 0.4 mm/sup 2/, including all support circuitry; only one cell per chip was integrated in order to facilitate circuit testing. Measured CNN transients from a prototype 4/spl times/4 CNN, formed by connecting 16 one-cell chips are shown. The principal intended applications are the processing of acoustical signals and algorithm development.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3049/8645/00381703.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"84","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A programmable, modular CNN cell","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.1994.381703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.1994.381703","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=381703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"A programmable, modular CNN cell","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4905677","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A programmable, modular CNN cell","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"00381703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040223S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec 1994","isNumber":"8645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3049","citationCount":"11","articleId":"381703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":381704,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In contrast to the linear modelling methods, there is still no clearly defined engineering process from which a model can reliably be created from measurements taken from a physical system. Problems for the practical application of neural networks involve the interpretation of the trained models, and the explicit introduction of a priori models into the learning system, as well as the use, in many cases, only basic ad hoc validation and experiment design techniques.

Machine recognition of faces has several applications, ranging from static matching of controlled photographs as in mug shots matching and credit card verification to surveillance video images. Such applications have different constraints in terms of complexity of processing requirements and thus present a wide range of different technical challenges. Over the last 20 years researchers in psychophysics, neural sciences and engineering, image processing analysis and computer vision have investigated a number of issues related to face recognition by humans and machines. Ongoing research activities have been given a renewed emphasis over the last five years. Existing techniques and systems have been tested on different sets of images of varying complexities. But very little synergism exists between studies in psychophysics and the engineering literature. Most importantly, there exists no evaluation or benchmarking studies using large databases with the image quality that arises in commercial and law enforcement applications In this paper, we first present different applications of face recognition in commercial and law enforcement sectors. This is followed by a brief overview of the literature on face recognition in the psychophysics community. We then present a detailed overview of move than 20 years of research done in the engineering community. Techniques for segmentation/location of the face, feature extraction and recognition are reviewed. Global transform and feature based methods using statistical, structural and neural classifiers are summarized.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381842/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","publicationDate":"May 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5003042","volume":"83","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Human and machine recognition of faces: a survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human and machine recognition of faces: a survey","sourcePdf":"00381842.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12368S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1632","articleId":"381842","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":381844,"authors":[{"name":"N.

It has been shown that neural networks can be used to augment speech recognizers whose underlying structure is essentially that of hidden Markov models (HMM's). In particular, we have demonstrated that fairly simple layered structures, which we lately have termed big dumb neural networks (BDNN's), can be discriminatively trained to estimate emission probabilities for an HMM. Recently simple speech recognition systems (using context-independent phone models) based on this approach have been proved on controlled tests, to be both effective in terms of accuracy (i.e., comparable or better than equivalent state-of-the-art systems) and efficient in terms of CPU and memory run-time requirements. Research is continuing on extending these results to somewhat more complex systems. In this paper, we first give a brief overview of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and statistical pattern recognition in general. We also include a very brief review of HMM's, and then describe the use of ANN's as statistical estimators. We then review the basic principles of our hybrid HMM/ANN approach and describe some experiments. We discuss some current research topics, including new theoretical developments in training ANN's to maximize the posterior probabilities of the correct models for speech utterances. We also discuss some issues of system resources required for training and recognition. Finally, we conclude with some perspectives about fundamental limitations in the current technology and some speculations about where we can go from here.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8651","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/8651/00381844.pdf","doi":"10.1109/5.381844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.381844","startPage":"742","endPage":"772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks for statistical recognition of continuous speech","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381844/","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks for statistical recognition of continuous speech","isJournal":true,"volume":"83","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5003043","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks for statistical recognition of continuous speech","sourcePdf":"00381844.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121674S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"84","articleId":"381844","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":381846,"authors":[{"name":"E.A.

We give this model the name \"dataflow process networks,\" and study its formal properties as well as its utility as a basis for programming language design. Variants of this model are used in commercial visual programming systems such as SPW from the Alta Group of Cadence (formerly Comdisco Systems), COSSAP from Synopsys (formerly Cadis), the DSP Station from Mentor Graphics, and Hypersignal from Hyperception. They are also used in research software such as Khoros from the University of New Mexico and Ptolemy from the University of California at Berkeley, among many others. Dataflow process networks are shown to be a special case of Kahn process networks, a model of computation where a number of concurrent processes communicate through unidirectional FIFO channels, where writes to the channel are nonblocking, and reads are blocking. In dataflow process networks, each process consists of repeated \"firings\" of a dataflow \"actor.\" An actor defines a (often functional) quantum of computation. By dividing processes into actor firings, the considerable overhead of context switching incurred in most implementations of Kahn process networks is avoided. We relate dataflow process networks to other dataflow models, including those used in dataflow machines, such as static dataflow and the tagged-token model. We also relate dataflow process networks to functional languages such as Haskell, and show that modern language concepts such as higher-order functions and polymorphism can be used effectively in dataflow process networks.

Part I of the paper presents a review of stochastic processes and spectral estimation (with some new results) and a tutorial on simulating continuous noise processes with a known autospectral density or autocorrelation function. In defining these techniques for computer generating sequences, it also defines the necessary accuracy criteria. These methods are compared to some of the common techniques for noise generation and the problems, or advantages, of each are discussed. Finally, Part I presents results on simulating stochastic differential equations. A Runge-Kutta (RK) method is presented for numerically solving these equations. Part II of the paper discusses power law, or 1/f/sup /spl alpha//, noises. Such noise processes occur frequently in nature and, in many cases, with nonintegral values for /spl alpha/. A review of 1/f noises in devices and systems is followed by a discussion of the most common continuous 1/f noise models. The paper then presents a new digital model for power law noises. This model allows for very accurate and efficient computer generation of 1/f/sup /spl alpha// noises for any /spl alpha/. Many of the statistical properties of this model are discussed and compared to the previous continuous models. Lastly, a number of approximate techniques for generating power law noises are presented for rapid or real time simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.381848","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/8651/00381848.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.381848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8651","startPage":"802","endPage":"827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete simulation of colored noise and stochastic processes and 1/f/sup /spl alpha// power law noise generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=381848","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discrete simulation of colored noise and stochastic processes and 1/f/sup /spl alpha// power law noise generation","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381848/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"83","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"5003045","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete simulation of colored noise and stochastic processes and 1/f/sup /spl alpha// power law noise generation","sourcePdf":"00381848.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070576S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"309","articleId":"381848","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":381906,"authors":[{"name":"L.J.

The proposed receiver assumes knowledge of the structure of the clutter covariance matrix, but does not require that of its amplitude probability density function (apdf). Performance is analytically evaluated, showing that the loss, as measured with respect to the corresponding optimum structure, is kept within a few dBs even for a relatively small number of integrated pulses and that it largely outperforms the matched-filter detector under all instances of practical interest.

It is assumed that estimates of the correlation properties of the clutter/interference may be obtained independently by processing the received vectors from a set of reference cells. We characterize the detection performance of this algorithm when the signal to be detected is modeled as a zero-mean complex Gaussian random vector with unknown correlation matrix. Results show that for a prescribed false alarm probability and a given signal-to-clutter ratio (to be defined in the text), the detectability of Gaussian random signals depends on the eigenvalues of the matrix R/sub c//sup -1/R/sub s/. The nonsingular matrix R/sub c/ and the matrix R/sub s/ are the correlation matrices of clutter-plus-noise and signal vectors respectively. It is shown that the \"effective\" fluctuation statistics of the signal to be detected is determined completely by the eigenvalues of the matrix R/sub c//sup -1/R/sub s/. For example the signal to be detected has an effective Swerling II fluctuation statistics when all eigenvalues of the above matrix are equal. Swerling I fluctuation statistics results effectively when all eigenvalues except one are equal to zero. Eigenvalue distributions between these two limiting cases correspond to fluctuation statistics that lie between Swerling I and II models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.381913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/8653/00381913.pdf","startPage":"647","endPage":"657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.381913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CFAR detection in clutter with unknown correlation properties","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=381913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381913/","displayDocTitle":"CFAR detection in clutter with unknown correlation properties","volume":"31","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4969433","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CFAR detection in clutter with unknown correlation properties","sourcePdf":"00381913.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041994S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"40","articleId":"381913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":381914,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In the particular problem under study, multiple vehicles are assigned unique codes and receiver filters that have nearly orthogonal signatures. Narrowband users, that act as interference, are also present within the system. A code selection algorithm is used to select codes which have low autocorrelation sidelobes and low cross correlation peaks. Optimal mismatched filters are designed for these codes which minimize the peak values in the autocorrelation and the cross correlation functions. An adjustment to the filter design technique produces filters with nulls in their frequency response, in addition to having low correlation peaks. The method produces good codes and filters for a four-user system with length 34 four-phase codes. There is considerable improvement in cross and autocorrelation sidelobe levels over the matched filter case with only a slight decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the system. The mismatched filter design also allows the design of frequency nulls at any frequency with arbitrary null attenuation, null width, and sidelobe level, at the cost of a slight decrease in processing gain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Poly-phase codes and optimal filters for multiple user ranging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/7.381922","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/8653/00381922.pdf","startPage":"752","endPage":"767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.381922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8653","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=381922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381922/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","displayDocTitle":"Poly-phase codes and optimal filters for multiple user ranging","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4969442","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Poly-phase codes and optimal filters for multiple user ranging","sourcePdf":"00381922.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088523S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"66","articleId":"381922","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":381927,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

It is demonstrated here that a phased-array radar that employs adaptive spatial degrees of freedom, plus two different sets of adaptive temporal degrees of freedom can effectively cancel the aforementioned interference to an acceptable level. The two different sets of temporal taps required for each antenna element consist of one set spaced by the pulse repetition interval, so as to cancel ground clutter, and another spaced by about one-half of the reciprocal of the radar bandwidth, so as to cancel the diffuse jammer multipath which may enter through the main beam of the radar, as well as its sidelobes. Using the ideal covariance matrix, a simulation has been developed, and the necessary conditions for cancellation are analyzed and discussed. It is also shown that the cancellation can be performed either with the antenna elements or a set of beams, but that the beam space approach requires fewer space-time degrees of freedom for nearly the same level of cancellation as the element space approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.381927","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/8653/00381927.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.381927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8653","startPage":"805","endPage":"820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cancellation of diffuse jammer multipath by an airborne adaptive radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=381927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cancellation of diffuse jammer multipath by an airborne adaptive radar","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381927/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4969447","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cancellation of diffuse jammer multipath by an airborne adaptive radar","sourcePdf":"00381927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031236S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"59","articleId":"381927","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":381947,"authors":[{"name":"Tien-Fu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tien-Fu Chen","id":"37087221193"},{"name":"Jean-Loup Baer","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Jean-Loup Baer","id":"37087997637"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"381947","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":285,"citationCountPatent":28,"totalDownloads":1168},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prefetching","Delay","Hardware","Bandwidth","Counting circuits","Computer science","Timing","Predictive models","Bridges","Coherence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","performance evaluation","fault tolerant computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-based data prefetching","high-performance processors","memory latency","hardware function unit","data cache","prefetching data accesses","data access patterns","reference prediction table","instruction cache","lookahead program counter","SPEC benchmarks","hardware prefetching schemes","lookahead scheme"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=381947","abstract":"Memory latency and bandwidth are progressing at a much slower pace than processor performance. In this paper, we describe and evaluate the performance of three variations of a hardware function unit whose goal is to assist a data cache in prefetching data accesses so that memory latency is hidden as often as possible. The basic idea of the prefetching scheme is to keep track of data access patterns in a reference prediction table (RPT) organized as an instruction cache. The three designs differ mostly on the timing of the prefetching. In the simplest scheme (basic), prefetches can be generated one iteration ahead of actual use. The lookahead variation takes advantage of a lookahead program counter that ideally stays one memory latency time ahead of the real program counter and that is used as the control mechanism to generate the prefetches. Finally the correlated scheme uses a more sophisticated design to detect patterns across loop levels. These designs are evaluated by simulating the ten SPEC benchmarks on a cycle-by-cycle basis. The results show that 1) the three hardware prefetching schemes all yield significant reductions in the data access penalty when compared with regular caches, 2) the benefits are greater when the hardware assist augments small on-chip caches, and 3) the lookahead scheme is the preferred one cost-performance wise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"609","endPage":"623","doi":"10.1109/12.381947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.381947","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/8654/00381947.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective hardware-based data prefetching for high-performance processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Effective hardware-based data prefetching for high-performance processors","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4969395","volume":"44","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective hardware-based data prefetching for high-performance processors","sourcePdf":"00381947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035569S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"285","articleId":"381947","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":381948,"authors":[{"name":"E.D.

The required modular operations, however, must use specialized hardware whose design and implementation can create several problems. In this paper a modified residue arithmetic, called pseudo-RNS is introduced in order to alleviate some of the RNS problems when digital signal processing (DSP) structures are implemented. Pseudo-RNS requires only the use of modified binary processors and exhibits a speed performance comparable with other RNS traditional approaches. Some applications of the pseudo-RNS to common DSP architectures, such as multipliers and filters, are also presented in this paper. They are compared in terms of the area-time square product versus other RNS and weighted binary structures. It is proven that existing combinatorial or look-up table approaches for RNS are tailored to small designs or special applications, while the pseudo-RNS approach remains competitive also for complex systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast combinatorial RNS processors for DSP applications","doi":"10.1109/12.381948","startPage":"624","endPage":"633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.381948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8654","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/8654/00381948.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=381948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Fast combinatorial RNS processors for DSP applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"44","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4969396","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast combinatorial RNS processors for DSP applications","sourcePdf":"00381948.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059909S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"63","articleId":"381948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":381953,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Chuang Tsay","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Information Engineering, College of Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jong-Chuang Tsay","id":"37087345211"},{"name":"Pen-Yuang Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Information Engineering, College of Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Pen-Yuang Chang","id":"37087626377"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"381953","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Scheduling algorithm","Processor scheduling","Difference equations","Iterative algorithms","Systolic arrays","Broadcasting","Pipelines","Partitioning algorithms","Ear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["processor scheduling","systolic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-optimal regular arrays","linear schedules","cubical mesh algorithms","processor allocation","Algorithm mapping","data dependency","linear schedule","matrix multiplication","optimizing compiler","space optimal","systolic array"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of space-optimal regular arrays for algorithms with linear schedules","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=381953","doi":"10.1109/12.381953","startPage":"683","endPage":"694","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/8654/00381953.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.381953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8654","abstract":"The problem of designing space-optimal 2D regular arrays for N/spl times/N/spl times/N cubical mesh algorithms with linear schedule ai+bj+ck, 1/spl les/a/spl les/b/spl les/c, and N=nc, is studied.

It has been confirmed that a nickel film sputtered onto n/sup +/- and p/sup +/-single-silicon and polysilicon substrates is uniformly converted into the mono-silicide (NiSi), without agglomeration, by low-temperature (400-600/spl deg/C) rapid thermal annealing. This method ensures that the silicided layers have low resistivity. Redistribution of dopant atoms at the NiSi-Si interface is minimal, and a high dopant concentration is achieved at the silicide-silicon interface, thus contributing to low contact resistance. This NiSi technology was used in the experimental fabrication of deep-sub-micrometer CMOS structures; the current drivability of both n- and p-MOSFET's was higher than with the conventional titanium salicide process, and ring oscillator constructed with the new MOSFET's also operated at higher speed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.381988","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/8655/00381988.pdf","startPage":"915","endPage":"922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.381988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-aligned nickel-mono-silicide technology for high-speed deep submicrometer logic CMOS ULSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=381988","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/381988/","displayDocTitle":"Self-aligned nickel-mono-silicide technology for high-speed deep submicrometer logic CMOS ULSI","volume":"42","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4953274","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-aligned nickel-mono-silicide technology for high-speed deep submicrometer logic CMOS ULSI","sourcePdf":"00381988.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079866S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"234","articleId":"381988","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":382009,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

In general, a joint detection and estimation algorithm cannot simultaneously achieve optimal detection and optimal estimation performance. We develop a multihypothesis testing framework for studying the tradeoffs between detection and parameter estimation (classification) for a finite discrete parameter set. Our multihypothesis testing problem is based on the worst case detection and worst case classification error probabilities of the class of joint detection and classification algorithms which are subject to a false alarm constraint. This framework leads to the evaluation of greatest lower bounds on the worst case decision error probabilities and a construction of decision rules which achieve these lower bounds. For illustration, we apply these methods to signal detection, order selection, and signal classification for a multicomponent signal in noise model. For two or fewer signals, an SNR of 3 dB and signal space dimension of N=10 numerical results are obtained which establish the existence of fundamental tradeoffs between three performance criteria: probability of signal detection, probability of correct order selection, and probability of correct classification. Furthermore, based on numerical performance comparisons between our optimal decision rule and other suboptimal penalty function methods, we observe that Rissanen's (1978) order selection penalty method is nearly min-max optimal in some nonasymptotic regimes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.382015","startPage":"688","endPage":"703","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.382015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8656","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/8656/00382015.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal simultaneous detection and estimation under a false alarm constraint","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382015/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal simultaneous detection and estimation under a false alarm constraint","volume":"41","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4959137","publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal simultaneous detection and estimation under a false alarm constraint","sourcePdf":"00382015.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03698S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"59","articleId":"382015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":382016,"authors":[{"name":"Yunxin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Yunxin Li","id":"37279903900"},{"name":"B.

The OSA, a new type of the conventional symbol-by-symbol maximum a posteriori probability algorithm, requires only a forward recursion and the number of variables to be stored and recursively updated increases linearly, rather than exponentially, with the decision delay. Then, with little performance degradation, a suboptimum soft-output algorithm (SSA) is obtained by simplifying the OSA. The main computations in the SSA, as in the VA, are the add-compare-select operations. Simulation results of a convolutional-coded communication system are presented that demonstrate the superiority of the OSA and the SSA over the conventional VA when they are used as detectors. When the decision delay of the detectors equals the channel memory, a significant performance improvement is achieved with only a small increase in computational complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.382016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.382016","startPage":"704","endPage":"713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/8656/00382016.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum soft-output detection for channels with intersymbol interference","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimum soft-output detection for channels with intersymbol interference","volume":"41","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4959138","publicationDate":"May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum soft-output detection for channels with intersymbol interference","sourcePdf":"00382016.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055548S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"122","articleId":"382016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":382017,"authors":[{"name":"N.

This result extends Rissanen's (1984, 1986) lower bound for parametric families. We demonstrate the applicability of this result in several examples, e.g., parametric families with growing dimensionality, piecewise-fixed sources, arbitrarily varying sources, and noisy samples of learnable functions. Finally, we discuss implications of our results to statistical inference.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/8656/00382017.pdf","startPage":"714","endPage":"722","doi":"10.1109/18.382017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.382017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A strong version of the redundancy-capacity theorem of universal coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382017/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"A strong version of the redundancy-capacity theorem of universal coding","publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4959139","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A strong version of the redundancy-capacity theorem of universal coding","sourcePdf":"00382017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039846S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"67","articleId":"382017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":382018,"authors":[{"name":"A.D.

We suppose that the quantization algorithm is dynamic programming, where the current step depends on a vector of path metrics, which we call a metric function. Our principal objective is a concise representation of these metric functions and the possible trajectories of the dynamic programming algorithm. We shall consider quantization of equiprobable binary data using a convolutional code. Here the additive group of the code splits the set of metric functions into a finite collection of subsets. The subsets form the vertices of a directed graph, where edges are labeled by aggregate incremental increases in mean squared error (MSE). Paths in this graph correspond both to trajectories of the Viterbi algorithm and to cosets of the code. For the rate 1/2 convolutional code [1+D/sup 2/, 1+D+D/sup 2/], this graph has only nine vertices. In this case it is particularly simple to calculate per dimension expected and worst case MSE, and performance is slightly better than the binary [24, 12] Golay code. Our methods also apply to quantization of arbitrary symmetric probability distributions on [0, 1] using convolutional codes. For the uniform distribution on [0, 1], the expected MSE is the second moment of the \"Voronoi region\" of an infinite-dimensional lattice determined by the convolutional code. It may also be interpreted as an increase in the reliability of a transmission scheme obtained by nonequiprobable signaling. For certain convolutional codes we obtain a formula for expected MSE that depends only on the distribution of differences for a single pair of path metrics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.382019","startPage":"732","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/8656/00382019.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.382019","endPage":"746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Covering properties of convolutional codes and associated lattices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382019/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Covering properties of convolutional codes and associated lattices","volume":"41","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4959141","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Covering properties of convolutional codes and associated lattices","sourcePdf":"00382019.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046121S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"17","articleId":"382019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":382020,"authors":[{"name":"E.

One way the effects of ITI may be alleviated is through the use of multiple-head systems simultaneously writing and reading a number of adjacent tracks. In this paper we investigate the performance of two-track detectors, and design codes that combat two-dimensional interference patterns, ISI in the axial dimension, and ITI in the radial dimension, and recover the loss in SNR due to track-narrowing. Sliding-block decoders and reduced-complexity Viterbi detectors are also designed for these codes, which are seen to more than compensate for the performance loss for a large range of ITI levels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.382020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.382020","endPage":"755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/8656/00382020.pdf","startPage":"747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding for two-head recording systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382020/","displayDocTitle":"Coding for two-head recording systems","volume":"41","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4959142","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding for two-head recording systems","sourcePdf":"00382020.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031166S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"13","articleId":"382020","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":382023,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The authors investigate the way in which distributed algorithms should be changed in order to operate efficiently in this new environment. They introduce a class of new models for distributed algorithms which make explicit the difference between switching and processing. Based on these new models they define new message and time complexity measures which, they believe, capture the costs in many high-speed networks more accurately then traditional measures. In order to explore the consequences of the new models, they examine three problems in distributed computation. For the problem of maintaining network topology they devise a broadcast algorithm which takes O(n) messages and O(log n) time for a single broadcast in the new measure. For the problem of leader election they present a simple algorithm that uses O(n) messages and O(n) time. The third problem, distributed computation of a \"globally sensitive\" function, demonstrates some important features and tradeoffs in the new models and emphasizes and differences with the traditional network model. The results of the present paper influenced later research, as well as the design of IBM Networking Broadband Services (NBBS).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/8656/00382023.pdf","startPage":"769","endPage":"780","doi":"10.1109/18.382023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.382023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New models and algorithms for future networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382023/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"New models and algorithms for future networks","publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4959145","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New models and algorithms for future networks","sourcePdf":"00382023.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067434S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"28","articleId":"382023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":382026,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The size of this opto-electrostatic microvortex (OEMV) in various liquids (water, ethanol, acetone, nitrobenzene) varied with the experimental conditions, but stayed in the 10-/spl mu/m range. The velocity of the liquid flow in the vortex could be controlled by the intensity and frequency of the electric field (5.0/spl times/10/sup 4/ to 0.8/spl times/10/sup 6/ V/m, 2/spl times/10/sup 4/ to 1/spl times/10/sup 6/ Hz), by the laser power (0.01 to 2 W) and by the laser power density in the focal point. No microvortex was observed in benzene and chloroform.

The advantages of accurate charge equalization are very substantial and include reduced damage to battery cells in the stack, and a dramatic increase in battery life.

The coaxial winding transformer is known for its low and controlled leakage inductance. The transformer leakage inductance is used as the main driving impedance to control the total charging current for the individual cells. The use of one low-power converter to obtain charge equalization for the entire battery string is very attractive and leads to a low cost implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1995","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 1995","accessionNumber":"4948319","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Charge equalization for series connected battery strings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Charge equalization for series connected battery strings","sourcePdf":"00382117.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051777S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1995","isNumber":"8658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"148","articleId":"382117","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":382123,"authors":[{"name":"M.T.

So far, they have been applied for a few cases, mainly in the control of converters and drives, but their application in estimation is practically new. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that such a technology can be applied for estimation of feedback signals in an induction motor drive with some distinct advantages when compared to DSP based implementation. A feedforward neural network receives the machine terminal signals at the input and calculates flux, torque, and unit vectors (cos /spl theta//sub e/ and sin /spl theta//sub e/) at the output which are then used in the control of a direct vector-controlled drive system. The three-layer network has been trained extensively by Neural Works Professional II/Plus program to emulate the DSP-based computational characteristics. The performance of the estimator is good and is comparable to that of DSP-based estimation. The system has been operated in the wide torque and speed regions independently with a DSP-based estimator and a neural network-based estimator, and are shown to have comparable performance. The neural network estimator has the advantages of faster execution speed, harmonic ripple immunity, and fault tolerance characteristics compared to DSP-based estimator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.382124","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/8658/00382124.pdf","startPage":"620","endPage":"629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.382124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based estimation of feedback signals for a vector controlled induction motor drive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=382124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382124/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based estimation of feedback signals for a vector controlled induction motor drive","volume":"31","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-June 1995","accessionNumber":"4948326","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based estimation of feedback signals for a vector controlled induction motor drive","sourcePdf":"00382124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024203S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1995","isNumber":"8658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"156","articleId":"382124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":382137,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The dynamic analysis based on the complex notation exhibits a formal correspondence to the description using matrices of axes-oriented components; yet differences exist. The complex notation appears superior in that it allows the distinguishing between the system eigenfrequencies and the angular velocity of a reference frame which serves as the observation platform. The approach leads to the definition of single complex eigenvalues that do not have conjugate values associated with them. The use of complex state variables further permits the visualization of AC machine dynamics by complex signal flow graphs. These simple structures assist to form an understanding of the internal dynamic processes of a machine and their interactions with external controls.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/8659/00382137.pdf","startPage":"263","endPage":"271","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.382137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.382137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=382137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The representation of AC machine dynamics by complex signal flow graphs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["AC machines","Flow graphs","Machine windings","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Differential equations","Graphics","Delay effects","Stators","Voltage","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","machine theory","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","signal flow graphs","machine windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC machine","dynamics representation","complex signal flow graphs","induction motors","nonlinear higher-order dynamic systems","eigenfrequencies","angular velocity","reference frame","observation platform","single complex eigenvalues","complex state variables","dynamics visualization","internal dynamic processes","external controls interaction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"The representation of AC machine dynamics by complex signal flow graphs","volume":"42","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4952759","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The representation of AC machine dynamics by complex signal flow graphs","sourcePdf":"00382137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035585S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"190","articleId":"382137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":382153,"authors":[{"name":"G.-H.

The two most attractive features of the 16-CAP transceiver are its capability of operating in the presence of multiple users in a voice-grade UTP cable and the straightforward way in which it can provide scalability to lower speeds. It is also shown in the paper how the carrierless AM/PM (CAP) modulation scheme used for the ATM LAN standard can be utilized to provide substantially higher data rates than 51 Mb/s when there is only one user in a cable. Under this condition, data rates up to 155 Mb/s can be achieved over category 3 wiring and significantly higher rates can be achieved over high-performance category 5 wiring.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.382153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.382153","endPage":"632","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8660/00382153.pdf","startPage":"620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"51.84 Mb/s 16-CAP ATM LAN standard","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382153/","displayDocTitle":"51.84 Mb/s 16-CAP ATM LAN standard","volume":"13","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4958687","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"51.84 Mb/s 16-CAP ATM LAN standard","sourcePdf":"00382153.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046444S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"122","articleId":"382153","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":382154,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For simulations of congested networks, the effective throughput of TCP over ATM can be quite low when cells are dropped at the congested ATM switch. The low throughput is due to wasted bandwidth as the congested link transmits cells from \"corrupted\" packets, i.e., packets in which at least one cell is dropped by the switch. The authors investigate two packet-discard strategies that alleviate the effects of fragmentation. Partial packet discard, in which remaining cells are discarded after one cell has been dropped from a packet, somewhat improves throughput. They introduce early packet discard, a strategy in which the switch drops whole packets prior to buffer overflow. This mechanism prevents fragmentation and restores throughput to maximal levels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.382154","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"633","endPage":"641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8660/00382154.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.382154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamics of TCP traffic over ATM networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Switches","Asynchronous transfer mode","Throughput","Packet switching","Communication system traffic control","Traffic control","Transport protocols","Bandwidth","Buffer overflow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication traffic","asynchronous transfer mode","channel capacity","telecommunication congestion control","packet switching","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TCP traffic","ATM networks","performance","congestion control","packet-based networks","congested networks","effective throughput","congested ATM switch","wasted bandwidth","corrupted packets","packet-discard strategies","fragmentation","partial packet discard","early packet discard","buffer overflow"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Dynamics of TCP traffic over ATM networks","volume":"13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4958688","publicationDate":"May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382154/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamics of TCP traffic over ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00382154.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097206S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"266","articleId":"382154","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":382159,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The choice of a p-channel transistor, whose gate-to-channel junction is forward biased by the leakage current from the detector, avoids the preamplifier feedback resistor and performs a continuous dc reset of the collected charge. The reported design, fully compatible with the detector fabrication, makes the operation of the detector extremely simple, ensures the best charge collection capability and leads to improved charge resolution. The first detector produced with this type of transistor has a resolution of 27 electrons rms in the measurement of the collected charge at room temperature for a pixel active area of about 0.1 mm/sup 2/, and of 22 electrons rms at T=210 K.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon radiation detectors","Electrons","Anodes","Leakage current","Leak detection","Preamplifiers","Feedback","Resistors","Fabrication","Area measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detector circuits","nuclear electronics","JFET circuits","silicon","elemental semiconductors","leakage currents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["p-JFET","silicon radiation detectors","collecting anode","p-channel transistor","gate-to-channel junction","leakage current","continuous dc reset","detector fabrication","charge collection capability","charge resolution","pixel active area","210 K","Si"]}],"doi":"10.1109/55.382242","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel1/55/8662/00382242.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.382242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel p-JFET embedded in silicon radiation detectors that avoids preamplifier feedback resistor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=382242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel p-JFET embedded in silicon radiation detectors that avoids preamplifier feedback resistor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382242/","volume":"16","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4969586","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel p-JFET embedded in silicon radiation detectors that avoids preamplifier feedback resistor","sourcePdf":"00382242.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054203S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"19","articleId":"382242","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":382256,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

This model is used to arrive at a definition of hard faults and soft faults and to derive a relationship between the relative number of occurrence for either fault.

To predict this sensitivity, one usually needs to compute the so-called critical area (A/sub c/), which reflects how many and how large the defects must be in order to result in a circuit failure. The main computational problem in yield estimation is to calculate A/sub c/ efficiently for complicated, irregular layouts. A novel approach is suggested for this problem that results in an algorithm that will solve it efficiently. This paper provides an interactive, accurate, and fast method for the evaluation of critical area as a design tool; the tool utilizes good visual feedback to allow layout improvement for higher yield. The algorithm is compared to other yield-prediction methods, which use either the Monte Carlo approach (VLASIC) or a deterministic approach (SCA); the algorithm is shown to be faster. It also has the advantage that it can graphically show a detailed 'defect sensitivity map' that can assist a chip designer in improving the yield of his/her layout.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4965185","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"An interactive VLSI CAD tool for yield estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interactive VLSI CAD tool for yield estimation","sourcePdf":"00382276.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041689S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"30","articleId":"382276","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":382279,"authors":[{"name":"Crid Yu","affiliation":["University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Crid Yu","id":"37087143661"},{"name":"Tinaung Maung","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Tinaung Maung","id":"37087720424"},{"name":"C.J.

Given the dimensional control limitations of new technologies, the amount of wafer-to-wafer and within wafer nonuniformity of many steps is becoming a significant fraction of the total error budget, which already includes the usual step-to-step allocations. However, a significant portion of the total observed variability is systematic in nature. Accordingly, particle defects may not continue to dominate parametric yield loss without improved understanding of parametric variations. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of short-loop electrical metrology to carefully characterize and decouple wafer-level variability of several critical processing steps. More specifically, we present our method and give results obtained from variability analyses for lithography critical dimension (CD) and inter-level dielectric (ILD) thickness control. Using statistically designed experiments and dedicated test structures, the main factors affecting dielectric thickness variability has been identified. The systematic variability from a wafer stepper has been extracted using a physically based statistical data filter. Once isolated, the deterministic variability can be modeled and controlled to enhance process and circuit design for manufacturability (DFM). We hope that in the future this work will be coupled with novel DFM-oriented CAD tools that encapsulate this information in a fashion that makes it useful to process and circuit designers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/66.382279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8664","startPage":"150","endPage":"159","pdfPath":"/iel3/66/8664/00382279.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/66.382279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of short-loop electrical measurements for yield improvement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electric variables measurement","Dielectrics","Error correction","Metrology","Lithography","Thickness control","Circuit testing","Data mining","Filters","Semiconductor device modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit yield","integrated circuit measurement","design for manufacture","design of experiments","lithography","design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-loop electrical measurements","design for manufacturability","submicron processes","CAD tools","process design","circuit design","test structures","wafer stepper","systematic variability","statistical data filter","deterministic variability","nonuniformity","parametric yield loss","parametric variations","wafer-level variability","lithography","critical dimension","inter-level dielectric thickness control","statistically designed experiments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Use of short-loop electrical measurements for yield improvement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382279/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4965187","publicationDate":"May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of short-loop electrical measurements for yield improvement","sourcePdf":"00382279.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036046S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"25","articleId":"382279","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":382281,"authors":[{"name":"V.K.R.

Our approach is based on modifications of the symbolic/physical layout to reduce the sensitivity of the design to random point defects without increasing the area, rather than fault tolerance techniques. A layout compaction algorithm is presented and the yield improvement results of some industrial layout examples are shown. This algorithm has been implemented in a commercial CAD framework. Some routing techniques for wire length and via minimization are presented, and the results of wire length reduction in benchmark routing examples are shown. We demonstrate through topological optimization for PLA-based designs that yield enhancement can be applied even at a higher level of design abstraction. Experimental results show that it is possible to achieve significant yield improvements without increasing the layout area by applying the proposed techniques during layout synthesis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4965190","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Layout-synthesis techniques for yield enhancement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layout-synthesis techniques for yield enhancement","sourcePdf":"00382281.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046571S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"50","articleId":"382281","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":382282,"authors":[{"name":"E.P.

An efficient distributed database design must trade off performance and cost among retrieval and update activities at the various nodes. It must consider the concurrency control mechanism used as well as capacity constraints at nodes and on links in the network. It must determine where data will be allocated, the degree of data replication, which copy of the data will be used for each retrieval activity, and where operations such as select, project, join, and union will be performed. We develop a comprehensive mathematical modeling approach for this problem. The approach first generates units of data (file fragments) to be allocated from a logical data model representation and a characterization of retrieval and update activities. Retrieval and update activities are then decomposed into relational operations on these fragments. Both fragments and operations on them are then allocated to nodes using a mathematical modeling approach. The mathematical model considers network communication, local processing, and data storage costs. A genetic algorithm is developed to solve this mathematical formulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8665","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/8665/00382299.pdf","doi":"10.1109/69.382299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.382299","startPage":"305","endPage":"317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Allocating data and operations to nodes in distributed database design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382299/","displayDocTitle":"Allocating data and operations to nodes in distributed database design","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4954452","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Allocating data and operations to nodes in distributed database design","sourcePdf":"00382299.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077983S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"53","articleId":"382299","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":382304,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It is shown that for block-tridiagonal matrices resulting from two-dimensional finite difference grids, the communication overhead due to vector inner products dominates the communication overheads of the remainder of the computation on a large number of processors. However, with a suitable mapping, the parallel formulation of a PCG iteration is highly scalable for such matrices on a machine like the CM-5 whose fast control network practically eliminates the overheads due to inner product computation. The use of the truncated Incomplete Cholesky (IC) preconditioner can lead to further improvement in scalability on the CM-5 by a constant factor,as a result, a parallel formulation of the PCG algorithm with IC preconditioner may execute faster than that with a simple diagonal preconditioner even if the latter runs faster in a serial implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","volume":"6","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4954620","displayDocTitle":"Performance and scalability of preconditioned conjugate gradient methods on parallel computers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and scalability of preconditioned conjugate gradient methods on parallel computers","sourcePdf":"00382315.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042225S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"27","articleId":"382315","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":382317,"authors":[{"name":"P.T.

To this end, we propose a pipelined communication mechanism-pipelined circuit-switching (PCS)-which is a variant of the well known wormhole routing (WR) mechanism. PCS relaxes some of the routing constraints imposed by WR and as a result enables routing behavior that cannot otherwise be realized. This paper presents a new class of adaptive routing algorithms-misrouting backtracking with m misroutes (MB-m). This class of routing algorithms is made possible by PCS. We provide an analysis of the performance and static fault-tolerant properties of MB-m. The results of an experimental evaluation of PCS and MB-3 are also presented. This methodology provides performance approaching that of WR, while realizing a level of resilience to static faults that is difficult to achieve with WR.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.382317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/8666/00382317.pdf","startPage":"482","endPage":"497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.382317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A family of fault-tolerant routing protocols for direct multiprocessor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=382317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382317/","displayDocTitle":"A family of fault-tolerant routing protocols for direct multiprocessor networks","volume":"6","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4954622","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A family of fault-tolerant routing protocols for direct multiprocessor networks","sourcePdf":"00382317.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034263S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"130","articleId":"382317","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":382334,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

Genetic algorithms are \"global\" numerical-optimization methods, patterned after the natural processes of genetic recombination and evolution. The algorithms encode each parameter into binary sequences, called a gene, and a set of genes is a chromosome. These chromosomes undergo natural selection, mating, and mutation, to arrive at the final optimal solution. After providing a detailed explanation of how a genetic algorithm works, and a listing of a MATLAB code, the article presents three examples. These examples demonstrate how to optimize antenna patterns and backscattering radar-cross-section patterns. Finally, additional details about algorithm design are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/74.382334","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","startPage":"7","endPage":"15","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/74/8667/00382334.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/74.382334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An introduction to genetic algorithms for electromagnetics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Electromagnetic scattering","Simulated annealing","Antenna radiation patterns","Solid modeling","Electromagnetic forces","Radar scattering","Biological cells","Algorithm design and analysis","Animals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","electromagnetic wave scattering","radar cross-sections","binary sequences","antenna radiation patterns","backscatter","complete computer programs","electrical engineering computing","electrical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","electromagnetics","tutorial","antenna patterns optimisation","scattering patterns optimisation","numerical-optimization methods","natural processes","genetic recombination","evolution","binary sequences","gene","chromosome","natural selection","mating","mutation","optimal solution","MATLAB code","backscattering radar-cross-section patterns","algorithm design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","displayDocTitle":"An introduction to genetic algorithms for electromagnetics","volume":"37","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4977444","publicationDate":"April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382334/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An introduction to genetic algorithms for electromagnetics","sourcePdf":"00382334.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036535S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"523","articleId":"382334","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":382336,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

The ray analysis is also extended to the hybrid QUACYLs (e.g. aircraft wings) and hybrid QUASORs (e.g., satellite-launch vehicles), by introducing Hertz's principle of particle dynamics to EM theory.

This paper addresses the problem of efficiently synthesizing such filters. A class of extremal filters is defined by the property that their magnitude spectrum maximizes an integral criterion. It is found that these filters are characterized by their zeros on the unit circle, which frequently can be obtained from a set of orthogonal polynomials. A family of filters is constructed that minimize the subband aliasing energy and can generate wavelets with an arbitrary number of vanishing moments. The algorithm for generating these filters makes use of the Levinson recursions, Gaussian quadrature and a fast version of Euclid's algorithm. Similar to other methods for constructing quadrature mirror filters, the spectral factorization of a polynomial is the computationally expensive part of this algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8669/00382392.pdf","startPage":"1045","endPage":"1057","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.382392","doi":"10.1109/78.382392","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=382392","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Finite impulse response filter","Low pass filters","Mirrors","Signal processing algorithms","Signal processing","Polynomials","Signal analysis","Frequency estimation","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transforms","quadrature mirror filters","FIR filters","band-pass filters","filtering theory","network synthesis","polynomials","poles and zeros"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extremal wavelet-generating filters","Gaussian quadrature","orthogonal wavelets","FIR quadrature mirror filters","finite impulse response","perfect reconstruction filter banks","filter synthesis","magnitude spectrum","integral criterion","zeros","unit circle","orthogonal polynomials","subband aliasing energy minimisation","Levinson recursions","Euclid's algorithm","spectral factorization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382392/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of extremal wavelet-generating filters using Gaussian quadrature","accessionNumber":"4971231","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","volume":"43","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of extremal wavelet-generating filters using Gaussian quadrature","sourcePdf":"00382392.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038543S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","articleId":"382392","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":382394,"authors":[{"name":"F.

I see ibid., vol.43, no.5, p.1090, 1990. In part I we studied the system-theoretic properties of discrete time transfer matrices in the context of inversion, and classified them according to the types of inverses they had. In particular, we outlined the role of causal FIR matrices with anticausal FIR inverses (abbreviated cafacafi) in the characterization of FIR perfect reconstruction (PR) filter banks. Essentially all FIR PR filter banks can be characterized by causal FIR polyphase matrices having anticausal FIR inverses. In this paper, we introduce the most general degree-one cafacafi building block, and consider the problem of factorizing cafacafi systems into these building blocks. Factorizability conditions are developed. A special class of cafacafi systems called the biorthogonal lapped transform (BOLT) is developed, and shown to be factorizable. This is a generalization of the well-known lapped orthogonal transform (LOT). Examples of unfactorizable cafacafi systems are also demonstrated. Finally it is shown that any causal FIR matrix with FIR inverse can be written as a product of a factorizable cafacafi system and a unimodular matrix.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Role of anticausal inverses in multirate filter-banks .II.

A number of parametric estimation techniques have been proposed in the literature. In general, these methods require knowledge of the sensor-to-sensor correlation of the noise, which constitutes a significant drawback. This difficulty can be overcome only by introducing alternative assumptions that enable separating the signals from the noise. In some applications, the raw sensor outputs can be preprocessed so that the emitter signals are temporally correlated with correlation length longer than that of the noise. An instrumental variable (IV) approach can then be used for estimating the signal parameters without knowledge of the spatial color of the noise. A computationally simple IV approach has recently been proposed by the authors. Herein, a refined technique that can give significantly better performance is derived. A statistical analysis of the parameter estimates is performed, enabling optimal selection of certain user-specified quantities. A lower bound on the attainable error variance is also presented. The proposed optimal IV method is shown to attain the bound if the signals have a quasideterministic character.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382403/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","volume":"43","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4971239","publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Array processing in correlated noise fields based on instrumental variables and subspace fitting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Array processing in correlated noise fields based on instrumental variables and subspace fitting","sourcePdf":"00382403.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048065S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"54","articleId":"382403","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":382404,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

It is shown how fourth-order cumulants of multichannel observations increase the directional information compared with second-order statistics. Based on the interpretation, it is shown how cumulants can be used to increase the effective aperture of an arbitrary antenna array. The amount of partial information necessary to jointly calibrate an arbitrary array and estimate the directions of far-field sources is also investigated. It is proven that the presence of a doublet and use of fourth-order cumulants is sufficient to accomplish this task. The proposed approach is computationally efficient and more general than covariance-based algorithms that have addressed the calibration problem under constraints. A class of beamforming techniques is proposed to recover the source waveforms. Proposed estimation procedures are based on cumulants, which bring insensitivity to the spatial correlation structure of additive Gaussian measurement noise. Simulations are provided to illustrate the use of the proposed algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.382404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.382404","endPage":"1216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8669/00382404.pdf","startPage":"1200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of cumulants to array processing .I.

Computable Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) expressions are derived on the frequency and phase estimates as well as on the sample mean or variance of the multiplicative noise processes. The zero- and nonzero-mean multiplicative noise cases are addressed separately and are shown to yield distinct CRBs on the frequency and phase estimates. Tight lower and upper bounds on the CRBs themselves are developed, which, relative to the CRBs, are intuitively more appealing and easier to implement.

Previous ESPRIT algorithms do not use the fact that the operator representing the phase delays between the two subarrays is unitary. The authors present a simple and efficient method to constrain the estimated phase factors to the unit circle, if centro-symmetric array configurations are used. Unitary ESPRIT, the resulting closed-form algorithm, has an ESPRIT-like structure except for the fact that it is formulated in terms of real-valued computations throughout. Since the dimension of the matrices is not increased, this completely real-valued algorithm achieves a substantial reduction of the computational complexity. Furthermore, Unitary ESPRIT incorporates forward-backward averaging, leading to an improved performance compared to the standard ESPRIT algorithm, especially for correlated source signals. Like standard ESPRIT, Unitary ESPRIT offers an inexpensive possibility to reconstruct the impinging wavefronts (signal copy). These signal estimates are more accurate, since Unitary ESPRIT improves the underlying signal subspace estimates. Simulations confirm that, even for uncorrelated signals, the standard ESPRIT algorithm needs twice the number of snapshots to achieve a precision comparable to that of Unitary ESPRIT. Thus, Unitary ESPRIT provides increased estimation accuracy with a reduced computational burden.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.382406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.382406","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8669/00382406.pdf","startPage":"1232","endPage":"1242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unitary ESPRIT: how to obtain increased estimation accuracy with a reduced computational burden","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Unitary ESPRIT: how to obtain increased estimation accuracy with a reduced computational burden","volume":"43","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4971242","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382406/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unitary ESPRIT: how to obtain increased estimation accuracy with a reduced computational burden","sourcePdf":"00382406.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04044S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"423","articleId":"382406","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":382410,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The approach has been applied to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, and variants are in use by many researchers, The method provides a mechanism for incorporating a range of sources of evidence without strong assumptions about their joint statistics, and may have applicability to much more complex systems that can incorporate deep acoustic and linguistic context. The method is inherently discriminant and conservative of parameters. Despite these potential advantages, the hybrid method has focused on implementing fairly simple systems, which do surprisingly well on large continuous speech recognition tasks, Researchers are only beginning to explore the use of more complex structures with this paradigm. In particular, they are just beginning to look at the connectionist inference of language models (including phonology) from data, which may be required in order to take advantage of locally discriminant probabilities rather than simply translating to likelihoods. Finally, the authors' current intuition is that more advanced versions of the hybrid method can greatly benefit from a perceptual perspective.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382443/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4971230","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Continuous speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00382443.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080319S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"115","articleId":"382443","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":382472,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The methodology has been implemented in a computer program called SCAPP (Symbolic Circuit Analysis Program with Partitioning). The method solves the problem by utilizing a hierarchical network approach and the sequence of expressions concept rather than a topological approach and the single expression idea which have dominated symbolic analysis in the past. The result is a linear growth (for real circuits) in the number of terms in the symbolic solutions for the network approach versus the exponential growth exhibited by traditional methods. The analysis methodology uses a Reduced Modified Nodal Analysis (RMNA) technique that allows the characterization of symbolic networks in terms of only a small subset of the network variables (external variables). The analysis algorithm is most efficient when network partitioning is used. Partitioning results in a reduction in the number of terms in the symbolic solutions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/8671/00382473.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","doi":"10.1109/81.382473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.382473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=382473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hierarchical network approach to symbolic analysis of large-scale networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Large-scale systems","Circuit analysis","Circuit simulation","Analytical models","Frequency","Circuit analysis computing","Transfer functions","Admittance","Algorithm design and analysis","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit analysis computing","symbol manipulation","network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical network approach","symbolic analysis","large-scale networks","computer program","SCAPP","reduced modified nodal analysis","network partitioning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"A hierarchical network approach to symbolic analysis of large-scale networks","volume":"42","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4960754","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hierarchical network approach to symbolic analysis of large-scale networks","sourcePdf":"00382473.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037939S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"58","articleId":"382473","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":382476,"authors":[{"name":"F.

No modification is necessary to an existing encoder, and no additional bit rate is required. The concealment algorithm is kept simple so that real-time decoding and concealment is possible. A single bit error in these images can cause a block to split into several blocks or several blocks to merge into one. This causes the DCT coefficients of all subsequent blocks to be correctly decoded but stored in the wrong location in the image. Furthermore, the DC coefficient of all subsequent blocks may be incorrect. The error concealment algorithm uses transform domain information to identify the location of the affected blocks and to correct errors. The image quality after error concealment is shown to be significantly improved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8672/00382489.pdf","startPage":"533","endPage":"542","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.382489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.382489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=382489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An error concealment algorithm for images subject to channel errors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Discrete cosine transforms","Bit rate","Error correction codes","Image sequences","Image coding","Transform coding","Degradation","Digital images","MPEG standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image sequences","variable length codes","error correction codes","discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error concealment algorithm","channel errors","still images","image sequences","discrete cosine transform","variable length codes","real-time decoding","real-time concealment","DC coefficient","transform domain information","error correction code","image quality","DCT coefficients"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","displayDocTitle":"An error concealment algorithm for images subject to channel errors","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4960737","pubMedId":"18290004","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An error concealment algorithm for images subject to channel errors","sourcePdf":"00382489.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083955S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"81","articleId":"382489","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":382490,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It uses the \"gain plus additive noise\" linear model for the Lloyd-Max quantizer. Based on this, it is demonstrated how, by an appropriate choice of synthesis filters, one can cancel all signal-dependent errors at the output of the system. The only remaining error is random in nature and not correlated with the input signal. We therefore have a tradeoff between the error being only random or having signal-dependent components as well (since the error variances in both cases are comparable). As a result of having only a random error, it is possible to reduce this error using, for example, a noise removal technique. The result is then extended to the case where the input is a multidimensional signal, and arbitrary sampling lattices are used, as well as to the QMF (alias cancellation) case. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach, two types of experiments on images are carried out: In a toy example, it is shown that using noise removal could be beneficial. For a more realistic coding scheme, however, it is demonstrated that even in the case when the model is no longer valid (when some of the subbands are discarded), the output error is still much less correlated with the input signal as opposed to the commonly used subband system, while visually, the reconstructed images look very similar.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.382490","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8672/00382490.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.382490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"543","endPage":"553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subband coding systems incorporating quantizer models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=382490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","displayDocTitle":"Subband coding systems incorporating quantizer models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382490/","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4960738","pubMedId":"18290005","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subband coding systems incorporating quantizer models","sourcePdf":"00382490.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038777S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"41","articleId":"382490","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":382492,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The goal of the filtering is to recover a high-quality image from degraded observations. Models for desired image structures and contaminating processes are employed, but deviations from strict assumptions are allowed since the assumptions on signal and noise are typically only approximately true. The robustness of filters is usually addressed only in a distributional sense, i.e., the actual error distribution deviates from the nominal one. In this paper, the robustness is considered in a broad sense since the outliers may also be due to inappropriate signal model, or there may be more than one statistical population present in the processing window, causing biased estimates. Two filtering algorithms minimizing a least trimmed squares criterion are provided. The design of the filters is simple since no scale parameters or context-dependent threshold values are required. Experimental results using both real and simulated data are presented. The filters effectively attenuate both impulsive and nonimpulsive noise while recovering the signal structure and preserving interesting details.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.382492","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"569","endPage":"578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.382492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8672","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8672/00382492.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear filters","Image restoration","Finite impulse response filter","Noise robustness","Signal processing","Filtering theory","Degradation","Least squares methods","Estimation theory","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image restoration","filtering theory","least squares approximations","estimation theory","nonlinear filters","image enhancement","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image restoration","robust nonlinear filter","nonlinear regression filters","robust estimation theory","image structures","image contaminating processes","error distribution","signal model","statistical population","processing window","biased estimates","filtering algorithms","least trimmed squares criterion","experimental results","simulated data","real data","nonimpulsive noise","impulsive noise","signal structure recovery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A robust nonlinear filter for image restoration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382492/","volume":"4","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4960740","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"18290007","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust nonlinear filter for image restoration","sourcePdf":"00382492.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04347S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"16","articleId":"382492","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":382493,"authors":[{"name":"Gaofeng Wang","affiliation":["Tanner Research, Inc., Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Gaofeng Wang","id":"37087200817"},{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Jun Zhang","id":"37087165485"},{"name":"Guang-Wen Pan","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Guang-Wen Pan","id":"37087167855"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"382493","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=382493","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverse problems","Image processing","Image restoration","Image reconstruction","Motion estimation","Senior members","Image resolution","Sparse matrices","Testing","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image restoration","image representation","image resolution","wavelet transforms","inverse problems","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","multiresolution sparse matrix representation","linear operator","linear inverse problems","wavelet expansion coefficients","image resolution","multigrid/multiresolution processing","multigrid algorithm","image representation","image restoration"]}],"abstract":"We describe a wavelet-based approach to linear inverse problems in image processing. In this approach, both the images and the linear operator to be inverted are represented by wavelet expansions, leading to a multiresolution sparse matrix representation of the inverse problem.

A unique feature of the wavelet approach is a general and consistent scheme for representing an operator in different resolutions, an important problem in multigrid/multiresolution processing. This and the sparseness of the representation induce a multigrid algorithm. The proposed approach was tested on image restoration problems and produced good results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.382493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.382493","endPage":"593","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8672/00382493.pdf","startPage":"579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solution of inverse problems in image processing by wavelet expansion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382493/","displayDocTitle":"Solution of inverse problems in image processing by wavelet expansion","volume":"4","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4960741","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18290008","publicationDate":"May 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solution of inverse problems in image processing by wavelet expansion","sourcePdf":"00382493.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054176S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"46","articleId":"382493","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":382494,"authors":[{"name":"Moon Gi Kang","affiliation":["Department of Elelctrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Duluth, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Moon Gi Kang","id":"37087158789"},{"name":"A.K.

A number of approaches have been developed in determining this parameter. In this paper, a new paradigm is adopted, according to which the required prior information is extracted from the available data at the previous iteration step, i.e., the partially restored image at each step. We propose the use of a regularization functional instead of a constant regularization parameter. The properties such a regularization functional should satisfy are investigated, and two specific forms of it are proposed. An iterative algorithm is proposed for obtaining a restored image. The regularization functional is defined in terms of the restored image at each iteration step, therefore allowing for the simultaneous determination of its value and the restoration of the degraded image. Both proposed iteration adaptive regularization functionals are shown to result in a smoothing functional with a global minimum, so that its iterative optimization does not depend on the initial conditions. The convergence of the algorithm is established and experimental results are shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382494/","volume":"4","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4965542","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"18290009","publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"General choice of the regularization functional in regularized image restoration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General choice of the regularization functional in regularized image restoration","sourcePdf":"00382494.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038685S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"163","articleId":"382494","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":382495,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Lin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chung Hua Polytechnic Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jia-Lin Chen","id":"37087199580"},{"name":"A.

First, the feature map of the image is formed using Laws' micromasks and directional macromasks. Each pixel in the feature map is represented by a sequence of 4-D feature vectors. The feature sequences belonging to the same texture are modeled as an HMM. Thus, if there are M different textures present in an image, there are M distinct HMMs to be found and trained. Consequently, the unsupervised texture segmentation problem becomes an HMM-based problem, where the appropriate number of HMMs, the associated model parameters, and the discrimination among the HMMs become the foci of our scheme. A two-stage segmentation procedure is used. First, coarse segmentation is used to obtain the approximate number of HMMs and their associated model parameters. Then, fine segmentation is used to accurately estimate the number of HMMs and the model parameters. In these two stages, the critical task of merging the similar HMMs is accomplished by comparing the discrimination information (DI) between the two HMMs against a threshold computed from the distribution of all DI's. A postprocessing stage of multiscale majority filtering is used to further enhance the segmented result. The proposed scheme is highly suitable for pipeline/parallel implementation. Detailed experimental results are reported. These results indicate that the present scheme compares favorably with respect to other successful schemes reported in the literature.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8672/00382495.pdf","startPage":"603","endPage":"619","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.382495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.382495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=382495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised texture segmentation using multichannel decomposition and hidden Markov models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Image segmentation","Image edge detection","Feature extraction","Filtering","Artificial intelligence","Merging","Distributed computing","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image texture","hidden Markov models","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised texture segmentation","multichannel decomposition","hidden Markov models","feature map","4-D feature vectors","model parameters","Laws' micromasks","coarse segmentation","fine segmentation","discrimination information","postprocessing stage","multiscale majority filtering","pipeline/parallel implementation","directional macromasks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised texture segmentation using multichannel decomposition and hidden Markov models","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4960742","pubMedId":"18290010","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised texture segmentation using multichannel decomposition and hidden Markov models","sourcePdf":"00382495.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050572S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"43","articleId":"382495","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":382496,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Our spatial temporal adaptive (STA) method reduces the computational complexity of the approximate partial eigenvalue decomposition based on image encoding. Spatial temporal encoding is used to reduce storage and computation, and then, singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied. After the adaptive discrete cosine transform (DCT) encoding, blocks that are similar in consecutive images are consolidated. The computational economy of our method was verified by tests on different large sets of images. The results show that this method is 6 to 10 times faster than the traditional SVD method for several kinds of real images. The economy of this algorithm increases with increasing correlation within the image and with increasing correlation between consecutive images within a set. This algorithm is useful for pattern recognition using eigenvectors, which is a research field that has been active recently.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Image coding","Discrete cosine transforms","Singular value decomposition","Signal processing algorithms","Pattern recognition","Face recognition","Character recognition","Object recognition","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","computational complexity","singular value decomposition","image sequences","image coding","discrete cosine transforms","image recognition","adaptive codes","conjugate gradient methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial eigenvalue decomposition","large images","spatial temporal adaptive method","eigenvectors","real image sequence","computational complexity","image encoding","storage","singular value decomposition","adaptive DCT encoding","computational economy","pattern recognition","conjugate gradient method"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.382496","startPage":"620","endPage":"629","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8672/00382496.pdf","doi":"10.1109/83.382496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial eigenvalue decomposition of large images using spatial temporal adaptive method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","displayDocTitle":"Partial eigenvalue decomposition of large images using spatial temporal adaptive method","accessionNumber":"4965543","pubMedId":"18290011","publicationDate":"May 1995","volume":"4","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial eigenvalue decomposition of large images using spatial temporal adaptive method","sourcePdf":"00382496.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049386S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"30","articleId":"382496","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":382503,"authors":[{"name":"Soo-Chang Pei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Soo-Chang Pei","id":"37086968340"},{"name":"Chien-Cheng Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-Cheng Tseng","id":"37087163224"},{"name":"Ching-Yung Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Yung Lin","id":"37087193937"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"382503","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":111},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Filtering","Fractals","Image coding","Optical filters","Neural networks","Adaptive filters","Fuzzy systems","Image restoration","Fuzzy neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractals","wavelet transforms","iterative methods","image coding","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transform","scale space filtering","fractal images","general scale shift mapping","geometrical complexity","construction rule","fractal dimension estimation","iterated function system codes","performance"]}],"abstract":"In this correspondence, we consider wavelet transform and scale space filtering as special cases of general scale shift mapping (SSM).

The technologies and systems that are currently providing, or are proposed to provide, wireless communications services can be grouped into about seven relatively distinct groups. All of the technologies and systems are evolving as technology advances and perceived needs change. Some trends are becoming evident in the evolutions. The different groups and evolutionary trends are explored along with factors that influence the characteristics of members of the groups. The grouping is generally with respect to scale of mobility and communications applications or modes. Different design compromises are evident in the different technologies and systems. The evidence suggests that the evolutionary trajectories are aimed toward at least three large groups of applications or services, namely, high-tier PCS (current cellular radio), high-speed wireless local-area networks (WLANS), and low-tier PCS (an evolution from several of the current groups). It is not clear to what extent several groups, e.g., cordless telephones, paging, and wide area data, will remain after some merging with the three large groups.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8673","publicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/98/8673/00382529.pdf","doi":"10.1109/98.382529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/98.382529","startPage":"20","endPage":"35","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless personal communications: what is it?","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382529/","displayDocTitle":"Wireless personal communications: what is it?","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4952527","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless personal communications: what is it?","sourcePdf":"00382529.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069108S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"146","articleId":"382529","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":382531,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A sub-millimeter resolution is obtained even in the presence of some acoustic noise, which could prevent other simple detection strategies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.1993.382566","startPage":"631","endPage":"635","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.1993.382566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8674","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3054/8674/00382566.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network for fast-response ultrasonic distance sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382566/","displayDocTitle":"A neural network for fast-response ultrasonic distance sensors","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4890357","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network for fast-response ultrasonic distance sensors","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00382566.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025683S","chronDate":"18-20 May 1993","isNumber":"8674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3054","citationCount":"4","articleId":"382566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":382567,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Some experimental tests were also performed to support the results of this analysis. A simple and synchronous sampling clock generator was tested under different signal-to-noise ratios.

Consisting of a quasi-synchronous window whose DTFT (discrete-time Fourier transform) has as small side-lobes as desired to reduce long-range leakage, and a compensation algorithm to reduce short-range leakage after the normal fast Fourier transform, this method will give much more accurate results of the amplitudes as well as the phases than the conventional method, especially for higher frequency components, when there exists an undesirable asynchronous deviation. This technique is also suited to analyzing multiple frequency signals and signals containing interharmonics. The only constraint is that the minimum frequency interval between two adjacent components of the signal should be wider than the window's resolution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.1993.382673","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3054/8674/00382673.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"98","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.1993.382673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-synchronous sampling algorithm and its applications II High accurate spectrum analysis of periodic signal","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-synchronous sampling algorithm and its applications II High accurate spectrum analysis of periodic signal","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 May 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4890250","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/382673/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-synchronous sampling algorithm and its applications II High accurate spectrum analysis of periodic signal","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00382673.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027016S","chronDate":"18-20 May 1993","isNumber":"8674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3054","citationCount":"8","articleId":"382673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":382690,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Such systems are applied in urban, suburban and rural areas with base station antennas on local exchange buildings in microcell or macrocell environments. The design and optimisation of these systems is essentially determined by the radio channel properties. One key-point is the time-variability of the radio channel by Doppler shift. Due to fixed subscribers this time-variability is caused mainly by moving scatterers in the surroundings. Measurements show its minor impact on the radio system performance compared to conventional mobile radio systems. Therefore wideband propagation measurements in the 2 GHz frequency range are performed in different realistic scenarios with respect to PCS applications for fixed base station and subscriber station. Measurement results of the wideband complex channel impulse response, data evaluations according to its time-variability and frequency selectivity are presented. These results are applicable to different multiple access schemes like TDMA and CDMA to obtain the necessary system requirements for the air interface, the signal processing algorithms and radio link engineering.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4911571","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Radio propagation for local loop applications at 2 GHz","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio propagation for local loop applications at 2 GHz","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028795S","chronDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3056","citationCount":"21","articleId":"383038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":383041,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Another interesting approach is based on orthogonal multi-carrier transmission called the orthogonal-frequency-division-multiple-access (OFDM) technique. This technique permits to achieve a high spectral efficiency and to combat the frequency selective fading and the interference in the channel by switching-off some sub-carriers. The aim of the article is to study the performance of the combination of a spread-spectrum system with OFDM in the presence of narrow-band interference. This combination allows one to use the spectrum in an efficient way, to exploit frequency diversity, to increase the robustness against fading and interference and to retain many advantages of a spread-spectrum system. The interference is considered as narrow-band multi-tone sine interference. A method for evaluating both interference and fading process based on frequency domain analysis is studied. The estimated interference and fading process is used for weighting each received chip before despreading. The results showed that the combination of spread-spectrum/OFDM in the presence of multi-tone narrow-band interference in a frequency/time selective fading channel is a promising approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383042","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3056/8676/00383042.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Narrow-band interference rejection in orthogonal multi-carrier spread-spectrum communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=383042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383042/","displayDocTitle":"Narrow-band interference rejection in orthogonal multi-carrier spread-spectrum communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4911567","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrow-band interference rejection in orthogonal multi-carrier spread-spectrum communications","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025981S","chronDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3056","citationCount":"10","articleId":"383042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":383043,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In this paper we show that the associated iterative decoder can be formulated in a simpler fashion by passing information from one decoder to the next using log-likelihood ratios as opposed to channel values that need to be normalized. This is in accordance with the MAP derivation of the component decoders. A drawback of the codes has been discovered: the BER curves show a flattening at higher signal-to-noise ratios, this is due to the small minimum distance of the whole code. By analyzing the interleaver used in the encoder we can calculate approximations to the BER at high SNRs. Finally, by careful interleaver manipulation the minimum distance of the code can be increased and the error-coefficient for the remaining small distance events can be further reduced. Furthermore, we have investigated the influence of the interleaver length on the SNR needed to achieve a certain BER; short lengths might be encountered in mobile and personal communications systems (e.g. voice transmission). Simulations confirm both the analytical approximation to the BER as well as the method for interleaver design which yields a marked improvement at higher SNR.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383050","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3056/8676/00383050.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving decoder and code structure of parallel concatenated recursive systematic (turbo) codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=383050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383050/","displayDocTitle":"Improving decoder and code structure of parallel concatenated recursive systematic (turbo) codes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4916978","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving decoder and code structure of parallel concatenated recursive systematic (turbo) codes","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03243S","chronDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3056","citationCount":"17","articleId":"383050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":383053,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Ju Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering and Center for Telecommunications Research, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, TW"],"lastName":"Chung-Ju Chang","id":"37276906400"},{"name":"Fang-Ching Ben","affiliation":["Dept. of Commun.

Rejection of multiple access interference (MAI) is achieved by the cross-correlation properties of the selected code family. However, before the receiver has acquired synchronism to the desired sequence, the presence of interference is a major impairment. It has been argued that the performance of the acquisition sub-system in CDMA systems may limit the multiple access capacity more than error probability specifications. Therefore, analysis of the acquisition of synchronism process in CDMA systems must take into account the effect of MAI. In this work the performance of a non-coherent straight serial search acquisition sub-system has been evaluated in the presence of interference from other users, data modulation and noise. For this purpose, an analytical approach has been used, which allows the characterization of the effects of the interfering sequences on the acquisition process without the adoption of a Gaussian approximation. Several configurations have been analysed, and their performance obtained in terms of mean time to acquisition and overall probability of detection.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383057","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3056/8676/00383057.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8676","startPage":"68","endPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acquisition of synchronism in direct sequence CDMA mobile networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=383057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Acquisition of synchronism in direct sequence CDMA mobile networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383057/","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4916971","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acquisition of synchronism in direct sequence CDMA mobile networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058718S","chronDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3056","articleId":"383057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":383058,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper we present architectures for code division multiple access (CDMA) based hybrid macrocell/microcell systems. These architectures are based on the principle of reducing the interference to macrocell users in a highly dense environment. This is accomplished by replacing the macrocell antenna with many microcell antennas, which are connected to a macrocell processor. The functions of this processor is to configure the proper connections between users and antennas. The characteristics of microcell propagation are used to justify the proposed antenna connection protocols which include 2-antenna and 3-antenna protocols. System architectures for both linear and two-dimensional service areas are discussed. System performance is evaluated in terms of carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR). The analysis procedure models the number of users in each cell as a Poisson distributed random variable. The CIR expressions for both the conventional and hybrid systems are reformulated. It is shown that the proposed architecture can lead to a dramatic increase in capacity as compared to conventional CDMA cellular systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved performance of a CDMA cellular system with macrocell diversity","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383059","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3056/8676/00383059.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=383059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Improved performance of a CDMA cellular system with macrocell diversity","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4916969","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved performance of a CDMA cellular system with macrocell diversity","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054027S","chronDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3056","citationCount":"2","articleId":"383059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":383060,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The performance relevant to a three-arms RAKE receiver, with a refined multipath tracking structure, is compared with that obtained by a less sophisticated RAKE receiver and, for reference purposes, with that of a classical receiver synchronized on the strongest path. The receiver makes use of a pilot signal transmitted by the base station for synchronization and channel equalization purposes. The effects of the multipath tracking algorithm and the sensitivity to some parameters of paramount importance (pilot to useful signal power ratio, mobile speed, quantization) have been simulated under multipath fading propagation conditions.

In many occasions, this side information is treated as the received SNR of the current channel symbol or that of previous symbols. In particular, the finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) provides a mathematically tractable model for time-varying channels and uses only the received SNR of the symbol immediately preceding the current one. The FSMC model is constructed by partitioning the range of the received SNR into a finite number of intervals. Each state of the channel corresponds to one of these intervals. For a first-order Markovian model, given the information of the state immediately preceding the current one, any other previous state should be independent of the current state. Although the experimental measurement confirms the usefulness of the first-order Markovian assumption, one may argue that second or higher-order Markov processes should provide a more accurate model. We answer this question by showing that given the information corresponding to the previous symbol, the amount of uncertainty remaining in the current symbol should be negligible.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383065","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3056/8676/00383065.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8676","startPage":"160","endPage":"164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On verifying the first-order Markovian assumption for a Rayleigh fading channel model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=383065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On verifying the first-order Markovian assumption for a Rayleigh fading channel model","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383065/","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4911579","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On verifying the first-order Markovian assumption for a Rayleigh fading channel model","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056889S","chronDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3056","citationCount":"32","articleId":"383065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":383067,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Such a scheme, implemented on the uplink, ensures that all users' signals arrive at the base station with equal average power as they move within the satellite spot beam. Because of the lengthy round-trip delay on a satellite link, closed-loop power control systems are only of marginal benefit. Therefore, an open-loop APC scheme is proposed to counteract the effects of shadowing. A fairly general channel model, consisting of log-normal shadowing; and Rician fading, is assumed. This can be applied to a specific two-state land mobile satellite channel model, involving shadowed intervals with Rayleigh fading and unshadowed intervals with Rician fading. It is found that the power control error can be approximated by a log-normally distributed random variable. To quantify the performance of the APC, the standard deviation of the power control error in decibels is derived.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3056/8676/00383120.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"444","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=383120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open-loop power control error on a land mobile satellite link","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Error correction","Satellites","Shadow mapping","Power system modeling","Rician channels","Large-scale systems","Adaptive systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","telecommunication control","land mobile radio","mobile satellite communication","fading","Rician channels","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["open-loop power control error","land mobile satellite link","shadowing","distance losses","adaptive power control scheme","base station","round-trip delay","open-loop APC scheme","Rician fading","log-normal shadowing","two-state land mobile satellite channel model","Rayleigh fading","unshadowed intervals","log-normally distributed random variable"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Open-loop power control error on a land mobile satellite link","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4904974","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open-loop power control error on a land mobile satellite link","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093928S","chronDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3056","citationCount":"6","articleId":"383120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":383122,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

The programmes comprise narrowband propagation measurements, wideband propagation measurements in a bandwidth of 10 to 30 MHz, as well as interference measurements for the satellite up- and down-link. For the narrowband and the wideband experiments, an aeroplane is modelling the satellites. Radiating a test signal at 1.8 GHz, the aircraft is flying on specific paths: (a) circles with various flight heights and radii; thus, the receiving area on the ground is fully characterized as a function of the azimuth and elevation angle; and (b) paths simulating the satellite's motion in azimuth and elevation. For the interference measurements, a spectrum analyzer samples the noise spectra. Measurements have been performed at several L- and S-band frequencies. Hits from fixed service transmitters into the satellite antenna are the main effects on the up-link, whereas man-made noise (e.g., caused by microwave ovens) dominates on the down-link. Selected results of all campaigns are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8676","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3056/8676/00383123.pdf","endPage":"429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DLR channel measurement programme for low Earth orbit satellite systems","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383123","startPage":"423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=383123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"DLR channel measurement programme for low Earth orbit satellite systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383123/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4904971","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DLR channel measurement programme for low Earth orbit satellite systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037863S","chronDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3056","citationCount":"8","articleId":"383123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":383125,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

We present an analysis regarding a direct sequence code division multiple access (CDMA) and narrowband frequency division multiple access (FDMA) overlay in a satellite environment and discuss models which describe the behaviour of the mutual interference to both systems. Although a CDMA system has an inherent resistance to jamming, an FDMA system with a large number of active users constitutes a severe interference problem for successful operation. Fortunately, a CDMA design affords some flexibility in parameters such as centre frequency, spread rate and power level which can be chosen by the designer in response to different FDMA implementations. We present results for various FDMA frequency allocations within the overlay and discuss the impact of coding and conforming to existing International Telecommunications Union (ITU) regulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A performance analysis of an overlay of CDMA and FDMA satellite communications systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383125","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3056/8676/00383125.pdf","startPage":"412","endPage":"417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=383125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"A performance analysis of an overlay of CDMA and FDMA satellite communications systems","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4904969","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A performance analysis of an overlay of CDMA and FDMA satellite communications systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039722S","chronDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3056","citationCount":"1","articleId":"383125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":383136,"authors":[{"name":"F.V.

The first scenario uses fixed location and paging areas. Mobiles perform a location update as they enter a new location area. The second scenario uses a time-out based location updating scheme. Mobiles start their timer as they leave the paging area they are currently registered in. As the timer elapses, the mobile performs a location update. Both scenarios also differ in the way paging is performed. In the first scenario it is only necessary to page in the location area the mobile is currently registered in. In order to do this efficiently, the paging is done in a 2-step fashion: mobiles are paged first in the paging area in which they were registered in, and next in the entire location area they are registered in. In the second scenario the mobile is paged in multiple steps: first in the paging area it is registered in, next in a circle of paging areas surrounding that area, and so on, until the mobile is found, or the number of steps has reached a certain upper limit. Results comprise a quantitative and qualitative comparison of these scenarios, and guidelines for optimal application.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evaluation of location management procedures","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383136","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3056/8676/00383136.pdf","startPage":"359","endPage":"364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=383136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"An evaluation of location management procedures","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4904958","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evaluation of location management procedures","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032021S","chronDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3056","citationCount":"51","articleId":"383136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":383144,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

In anticipation of the union of these two technologies, packet based CDMA is studied. In particular, for a fixed size data packet, the effects of code rate on the decoded bit error rate is investigated. By increasing the redundancy for error correction, more errors can be corrected; however, more co-channel interference is introduced. Through the analysis of the trade-off between redundancy and co-channel interference, it will be shown that an optimum code rate exists. For a Rayleigh fading and lognormal shadowing channel with ideal power control and ideal interleaving, the channel symbol error rate for the forward and reverse link is derived. Using these expressions, an upper bound on the decoded bit error rate is determined. Performing a numerical evaluation, some results are provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code rate optimization for coded packet CDMA cellular networks","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383144","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3056/8676/00383144.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=383144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Code rate optimization for coded packet CDMA cellular networks","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4904950","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code rate optimization for coded packet CDMA cellular networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.019627S","chronDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3056","citationCount":"1","articleId":"383144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":383154,"authors":[{"name":"H.H.

To the future personal communications services (PCS), a comprehensive study of CDMA PCS in the 1.8 GHz band in various radio environments has been conducted by Telesis Technologies Laboratory (TTL) in cooperation with Qualcomm Inc. in San Diego. We present the results of TTL's study on spectrum sharing feasibility for CDMA PCS. The study demonstrated that in rural and suburban areas, where microwave beams are generally well confined and easy to be predicted, it is possible to significantly reduce the PCS forward link interference to OFS by carefully facilitating coordination between microwave terminals and PCS base stations. The CDMA spectrum sharing capabilities can be substantially improved by taking advantage of rigorous power control for the CDMA systems. In the case of the mobile stations inside the microwave beam, the unique feature of soft hand-off for CDMA systems shows significance in reducing interference to the fixed microwave.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383154","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3056/8676/00383154.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8676","startPage":"267","endPage":"271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sharing feasibility for CDMA PCS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=383154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sharing feasibility for CDMA PCS","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383154/","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4904940","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sharing feasibility for CDMA PCS","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038411S","chronDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3056","citationCount":"1","articleId":"383154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":383157,"authors":[{"name":"L.P.

The current design trend for these systems is to deploy a large number of small cells, each served by a base station incorporating a conventional antenna system. Although this approach addresses the coverage problem, it has a number of significant drawbacks. Large numbers of small cells result in reduced trunking efficiency, increased system complexity, increased system costs and increased deployment times. If antenna arrays coupled with adaptive signal processing techniques are employed at the base station, however, improved coverage, capacity and trunking efficiency can be obtained with cells of moderate to large size. Spatial division multiple access (SDMA) is a particular approach to the use of base station antenna arrays in PCS systems. The authors describe the fundamentals of the SDMA approach and its key impacts on the design of PCS systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383159","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 3rd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3056/8676/00383159.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1994.383159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impacts of SDMA on PCS system design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=383159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383159/","displayDocTitle":"The impacts of SDMA on PCS system design","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4904935","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impacts of SDMA on PCS system design","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037815S","chronDate":"27 Sep-1 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3056","citationCount":"13","articleId":"383159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":383256,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This means the requirement of charging energy e/sup 2/(2C) being much larger than the thermal energy could only be met at very low temperatures.

It is also shown how 64 M flash memories can be achieved without such a technology breakthrough.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4905056","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The solution of over-erase problem controlling poly-Si grain size-modified scaling principles for flash memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The solution of over-erase problem controlling poly-Si grain size-modified scaling principles for flash memory","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031119S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","isNumber":"8678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3058","citationCount":"21","articleId":"383280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":383281,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The threshold voltage of DTMOS drops as the gate voltage is raised, resulting in a much higher current drive than standard MOSFET at low power supply voltages. On the other hand, V/sub t/ is high at V/sub gs/=0, therefore the leakage current is low. We provide experimental results and 2-D device and mixed-mode simulations to analyze DTMOS and compare its performance with a standard MOSFET. These results verify excellent DC inverter characteristics down to V/sub dd/=0.2 V, and good ring oscillator performance down to 0.3 V for DTMOS.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4905047","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic threshold voltage MOSFET (DTMOS) for ultra-low voltage operation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic threshold voltage MOSFET (DTMOS) for ultra-low voltage operation","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062011S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","isNumber":"8678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3058","citationCount":"116","articleId":"383301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":383315,"authors":[{"name":"Hon-Sum Wong","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

The CCD has both a storage region under a thick gate oxide and a barrier region under a thin gate oxide for each transfer electrode. In order to attain high charge transfer efficiency for an extremely low driving voltage below 2 V, a new alignment-deviation-free structure and a potential pocket suppression structure are introduced. A 1/3 inch format 270 K pixel IT-CCD image sensor with the horizontal CCD driving voltage of 1.8 V is developed by employing the single layer electrode structure for the first time. The four-phase vertical CCDs also have the single layer electrode structure.

Accordingly SOISPICE-aided examinations of SRAM and DRAM circuits imply that conservative designs will be necessitated in PD/SOI technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1994.383323","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3058/8678/00383323.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"664","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1994.383323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic floating-body instabilities in partially depleted SOI CMOS circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic floating-body instabilities in partially depleted SOI CMOS circuits","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4897350","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383323/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic floating-body instabilities in partially depleted SOI CMOS circuits","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040935S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","isNumber":"8678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3058","citationCount":"47","articleId":"383323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":383329,"authors":[{"name":"K.

However, Q/sub BD/ for negative gate bias (-V/sub g/) shows an opposite trend to Q/sub BD/(+V/sub g/), i.e. Q/sub BD/(-V/sub g/) decreases dramatically with decreasing oxide thickness. Therefore, there is an increased polarity dependence of dielectric breakdown when oxide thickness scales down.

During high constant current stressing, V/sub G/ variation with time shows two distinct modes, i.e., a stable mode and a fluctuation mode named as quasi-breakdown. Once the quasi-breakdown starts, gate current in low field abruptly increases. From the experimental results, it could be concluded that the quasi-breakdown occurs when injected electrons travel in the oxide conduction band ballistically. Localized physical damage near the Si/SiO/sub 2/ interface is believed to be the cause of the quasi-breakdown, The great increase of gate current after the quasi-breakdown was modeled by a superposition of F-N tunneling current and direct tunneling current with a finite series resistance, and a good agreement has been found.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3058/8678/00383337.pdf","startPage":"605","endPage":"608","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1994.383337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1994.383337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8678","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=383337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-breakdown of ultrathin gate oxide under high field stress","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fluctuations","Tunneling","Electric breakdown","Electrons","Leakage current","Monitoring","Stress measurement","Research and development","Electronics industry","MOS devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor device reliability","MIS devices","electric breakdown","dielectric thin films","failure analysis","silicon","elemental semiconductors","silicon compounds","tunnelling","semiconductor device models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrathin gate oxide","high field stress","oxide failure mode","constant current stressing","fluctuation mode","quasi-breakdown","injected electrons","localized physical damage","Si/SiO/sub 2/ interface","superposition","F-N tunneling current","direct tunneling current","series resistance","MOS devices","device failure","Si-SiO/sub 2/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-breakdown of ultrathin gate oxide under high field stress","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4897336","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-breakdown of ultrathin gate oxide under high field stress","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065475S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","isNumber":"8678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3058","citationCount":"64","articleId":"383337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":383338,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Yin Hao","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Center, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Ming-Yin Hao","id":"37086996406"},{"name":"Kafai Lai","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Center, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Kafai Lai","id":"37087574173"},{"name":"Wei-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Center, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Wei-Ming Chen","id":"37087159468"},{"name":"J.C.

In this paper, a novel \"two-step dip\" wafer-cleaning procedure is proposed for ultra-thin dielectric growth. Improved dielectric integrity has been observed for ultra-thin thermal oxides and N/sub 2/O oxynitrides fabricated using this surface preparation technique. Dielectric breakdown mechanism for the ultra-thin N/sub 2/O oxynitrides was also investigated in this study. It was found that holes generated within the dielectrics were responsible for the catastrophic breakdown for both thermal oxides and N/sub 2/O oxynitrides within the thickness range studied (33-87 /spl Aring/). In addition, stress-induced leakage current (SILC) does not monotonically increase when the dielectrics are aggressively scaled down to the ultra-thin regime. This \"turn-around\" effect of SILC can be explained using the trap-assisted tunneling model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1994.383338","startPage":"601","endPage":"604","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3058/8678/00383338.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1994.383338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability characteristics and surface preparation technique for ultra-thin (33 /spl Aring/-87 /spl Aring/) oxides and oxynitrides","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dielectric substrates","Leakage current","Tunneling","Surface cleaning","Electron traps","Design for quality","Silicon","Hydrogen","Passivation","Hafnium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOS capacitors","semiconductor device reliability","surface cleaning","electric breakdown","dielectric thin films","leakage currents","tunnelling","semiconductor process modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability characteristics","surface preparation technique","ultra-thin oxides","ultra-thin oxynitrides","dielectric breakdown","stress-induced leakage current effects","wafer-cleaning procedure","two-step dip","dielectric integrity","catastrophic breakdown","trap-assisted tunneling model","MOS capacitors","33 to 87 angstrom","N/sub 2/O"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Reliability characteristics and surface preparation technique for ultra-thin (33 /spl Aring/-87 /spl Aring/) oxides and oxynitrides","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4897335","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability characteristics and surface preparation technique for ultra-thin (33 /spl Aring/-87 /spl Aring/) oxides and oxynitrides","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051713S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","isNumber":"8678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3058","citationCount":"2","articleId":"383338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":383340,"authors":[{"name":"H.S.

It was found that these devices operate well when the gate length is around 0.1 /spl mu/m, because gate leakage current falls in proportion to the gate length and the drain current increases in inverse proportion. A very high drivability of 1.1 mAspl mu/m at 15 V was obtained, even in devices with a 0.14 pm gate length. A record high transconductance, 1,010 mS/mm at room temperature was also obtained in 0.09 /spl mu/m MOSFETs. Confirmation was obtained that hot-carrier reliability improves as the gate oxide thickness is reduced, even in the 1.5 nm case. High current drive at the low supply voltage of 0.5 V was also demonstrated. We made clear that very high performance is obtained in Si MOSFETs, if we can use a high capacitance gate insulator. In future devices, the tunnel gate oxide may be a good candidate for such a gate film, depending upon their applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tunneling gate oxide approach to ultra-high current drive in small geometry MOSFETs","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1994.383340","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3058/8678/00383340.pdf","startPage":"593","endPage":"596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1994.383340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8678","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=383340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Tunneling gate oxide approach to ultra-high current drive in small geometry MOSFETs","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4897333","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tunneling gate oxide approach to ultra-high current drive in small geometry MOSFETs","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030678S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","isNumber":"8678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3058","citationCount":"53","articleId":"383340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":383353,"authors":[{"name":"E.

These devices are demonstrated in a novel circuit consisting of only two devices and capable of computing a 5-bit absolute-value-of-difference at an energy consumption of less than 1 pJ.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383371/","accessionNumber":"4891452","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Flash-based programmable nonlinear capacitor for switched-capacitor implementations of neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flash-based programmable nonlinear capacitor for switched-capacitor implementations of neural networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044262S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","isNumber":"8678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3058","citationCount":"7","articleId":"383371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":383376,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This model, combined with an interface charge generation model, is used to study effects of stress-induced interface and oxide charges on flash device erase and programming speeds, band-to-band tunneling leakage current, and threshold voltage shift. An efficient cycle-weighting method is introduced to simulate flash device programming/erase (P/E) cycle endurance. Excellent agreement has been achieved between the simulation predications and experimental data over various operation conditions without parameter fittings or preassumed interface and oxide charge distributions. Simulation results show that the endurance characteristics are mainly affected by both the P/E gate current reduction due to oxide charges and the flat-band voltage increase due to both oxide and interface charges.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1994.383409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1994.383409","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3058/8678/00383409.pdf","startPage":"295","endPage":"298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flash EPROM endurance simulation using physics-based models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Flash EPROM endurance simulation using physics-based models","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4886261","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flash EPROM endurance simulation using physics-based models","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038933S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","isNumber":"8678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3058","citationCount":"9","articleId":"383409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":383410,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We discuss the relationship between the HBT collector structure and its microwave power performance, demonstrating that the launcher structure suppresses the Kirk effect near the saturation region and increases the current handling capability. A fabricated HBT, which has an emitter size of 2 /spl mu/m/spl times/20 /spl mu/m/spl times/32 fingers, exhibits a power added efficiency, /spl eta/add, of 70% with an output power, Pout, of 30 dBm and a power gain, Ga, of 15.7 dB at a supply voltage of 3.5 V and a frequency of 900 MHz. At 2.5 V, Pout is 26.5 dBm, /spl eta/add is 70% and Ga is 14.7 dB. These results demonstrate that HBTs with a collector launcher structure are appropriate for power applications, especially at low voltage operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383432/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4886238","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","displayDocTitle":"3.5 V, 1 W high efficiency AlGaAs/GaAs HBTs with collector launcher structure","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3.5 V, 1 W high efficiency AlGaAs/GaAs HBTs with collector launcher structure","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069955S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","isNumber":"8678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3058","citationCount":"10","articleId":"383432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":383433,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It is shown, for the first time, that a L/sub g/=0.25 /spl mu/m and t/sub ox/=85 /spl Aring/ transistor utilizing a pocket implant together with a light V/sub TN/ implant (pocket-with-V/sub TN/) can satisfy the stringent requirements of subthreshold leakage, diode leakage, V/sub T/ during charging, and a tolerance for L/sub g/ variation of 0.08 /spl mu/m for manufacturability. The success of the pocket-implant device in meeting the above design spec is due to the reduced V/sub T/ roll-off at shorter L/sub g/ and reduced body effect at longer L/sub g/ compared to those of a conventional device. An optimum range of substrate bias is determined to be -1.5 to -2 V.

The SA-STI technology results in an extremely small cell size of 0.67 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ per bit, 67% of the smallest flash memory cell reported so far, by using a 0.35 /spl mu/m technology. The key technologies to realize a small cell size are (1) 0.4 um width Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) to isolate neighboring bits and (2) a floating gate that is self-aligned with the STI, eliminating the floating-gate wings. Even though the floating-gate wings are eliminated, a high coupling ratio of 0.65 can be obtained by using the side-walls of the floating gate to increase the coupling ratio. Using this self-aligned structure. A reliable tunnel oxide can be obtained because the floating gate does not overlap the trench corners, so enhanced tunneling at the trench corner is avoided. Therefore, the SA-STI cell combines a low bit cost with a high performance and a high reliability, such as the fast programming (0.2 /spl mu/sec/byte), fast erasing (2 msec), good write/erase endurance (>10/sup 6/ cycles), and excellent read disturb characteristics(>10 years). This paper describes the process technologies and the device performance of the SA-STI cell, which can be used to realize NAND EEPROMs of 256 Mbit and beyond.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Isolation technology","Nonvolatile memory","Fabrication","Tunneling","EPROM","Etching","Power supplies","Costs","Filling","Dielectrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EPROM","MOS memory circuits","NAND circuits","isolation technology","integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-aligned shallow trench isolation cell","SA-STI cell","NAND EEPROMs","ultra high-density memory cell","low bit cost","flash EEPROM","self-aligned floating gate","high coupling ratio","reliable tunnel oxide","high performance","high reliability","fast programming","fast erasing","write/erase endurance","read disturb characteristics","process technologies","3 V","256 Mbit","0.35 micron","2 ms","10 year"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=383466","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1994.383466","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3058/8678/00383466.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1994.383466","startPage":"61","endPage":"64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8678","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.67 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ self-aligned shallow trench isolation cell (SA-STI cell) for 3 V-only 256 Mbit NAND EEPROMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 0.67 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ self-aligned shallow trench isolation cell (SA-STI cell) for 3 V-only 256 Mbit NAND EEPROMs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4881004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 0.67 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ self-aligned shallow trench isolation cell (SA-STI cell) for 3 V-only 256 Mbit NAND EEPROMs","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044278S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","isNumber":"8678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3058","citationCount":"12","articleId":"383466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":383468,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The bottom n-well layer, which surrounds the p-well, is used as electron supply source in the SHE. By adopting SHE for erasure, the electric field required across the tunnel oxide was reduced to 1/4, compared with FN erasure. It needs less than 1 second for erasure, which is sufficient for DINOR operation. It is shown that V th window narrowing during erase/write cycling was significantly reduced by using SHE for erasure, as compared with using FN tunneling.

In the VLSI era, however, difficulties have arisen with respect to storage capacitance. As a result, cost advantages have been reduced to the level expressed by \"The Bi Rule\". The use of materials with a high dielectric constant and the use of the polarization reversal current of ferroelectric materials are not perfect solutions to this problem because they are not in accordance with the scaling rule. Ferroelectric memories using the field effect current of a semiconductor by the remanent polarization of the ferroelectric material, however, are in accordance with the scaling rule. The first experimental verification of the nonvolatile memory action was reported by Moll and Tarui in 1963, and this basic memory action has been used in MFS transistors. Ferroelectric memories are nonvolatile and are expected to be high-speed devices, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, but it will be necessary to optimize the interface between the semiconductor and ferroelectric material. This is a worthwhile challenge in the effort to develop new memories for the 21st century.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383474/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4880996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Future DRAM development and prospects for ferroelectric memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Future DRAM development and prospects for ferroelectric memories","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00383474.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064572S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 1994","isNumber":"8678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3058","citationCount":"7","articleId":"383474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":383587,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

The problem that we deal with is the determination of the location, size, orientation and shape of a major portion of the human brain stem: an extended anatomical structure of the middle and lower brain. This object is not easily visualizable and cannot be extracted with traditional intermediate level segmentation techniques because only its lower part (cortico-spinal tract) and upper part (mesencephalon) are well defined. A substantial length is completely connected with the rest of the brain by the right and left superior and inferior cerebellar peduncles and the central tegmental tract, having almost the same image intensity, making our approach especially advantageous over other segmentation techniques. The search problem can be considered as a one of large scale optimisation and we describe a genetic algorithm (GA) based method for its solution. Finally we briefly describe recent extensions to our approach that allow the GA-based system to be used for arbitrarily shaped objects.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Genetic Algorithms in Image Processing and Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Genetic Algorithms in Image Processing and Vision","pdfPath":"/iel3/3066/8686/00383626.pdf","startPage":"8/1","endPage":"8/7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms and deformable geometric models for anatomical object recognition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8686","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=383626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/383626/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1994","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms and deformable geometric models for anatomical object recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4834988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-20 Oct. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms and deformable geometric models for anatomical object recognition","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00383626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021739S","chronDate":"1994","isNumber":"8686","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3066","citationCount":"3","articleId":"383626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":383628,"authors":[{"name":"N.R.

RDD-100 adopts the view that systems development is best achieved by incrementally developing a system model that will persist over the lifecycle and be shared and managed by the people involved. RDD-100 provides a unique capability of modelling system behaviour and investigating the dynamic aspects of this behaviour. It enables system architectures to be represented and provides valuable information which can be used as the basis for trade-off analysis. RDD-100 also supports system requirements extraction, traceability from requirements to system specification and design, and the ability to generate major reports directly from the RDD-100 database.

Timing alone does not distinguish all rhythms for all patients. Hence, more computationally intensive morphology analysis is required for complete diagnosis. An analog VLSI neural network has been designed and tested to perform cardiac morphology classification tasks. Analog techniques were chosen to meet the strict power and area requirements of the implantable system while incurring the design difficulties of noise, drift and offsets inherent in analog approaches. The robustness of the neural network architecture however, to a large extent, overcomes these inherent shortcomings of the analog approach. The network is a 10:6:3 multilayer perceptron with on chip digital weight storage. The chip also includes a bucket brigade input to feed the Intracardiac Electrogram (ICEG) to the network and a Winner Take All circuit for converting classifications to a binary representation. The training system trained the network in loop and included a commercial implantable defibrillator in the signal processing path. The system has successfully distinguished two arrhythmia classes on a morphological basis for seven different patients with an average of 95% true positive and 97% true negative detections for the dangerous rhythm.

To achieve minimum energy design goals, system designers need a technique to accurately model the energy consumption of their design alternatives without performing a full physical design and full-circuit simulation. This paper presents and compares five approaches for modeling the energy consumption of CMOS circuits. These five modeling approaches have been chosen to represent the various levels of model complexity and accuracy found in the current literature. These modeling approaches are applied to the energy consumption of SRAM's to provide examples of their use and to allow for the comparison of their modeling qualities. It was found that a mixed characterization model-using a CV/sup 2/ prediction for digital subsections and fitted simulation results for the analog subsections-is satisfactory (within /spl plusmn/1 process variation) for predicting the absolute energy consumed per cycle. This same model is also very good (within 2%) for predicting an optimum organization for the internal structures of the SRAM. Several common architectures and circuit designs for SRAM's are analyzed with these models. This analysis shows that global, rather than local improvements, produce the largest energy savings.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/384170/","volume":"30","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4963973","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy consumption modeling and optimization for SRAM's","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy consumption modeling and optimization for SRAM's","sourcePdf":"00384170.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050911S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"51","articleId":"384170","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":384171,"authors":[{"name":"F.

As originally developed for cellular mobile radio (CMR) systems, the sector average is obtained from the spatial average of the received signal as the mobile traverses a path of 20 or so wavelengths. This approach has also been applied indoors with the assumption that a unique average could be obtained by moving either end of the radio link. Unlike the CMR path for indoor propagation, however, both ends of the radio link are in a rich multipath environment. It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that moving both ends of the link is required to achieve a unique average. When averaging is accomplished by moving only one end, the result can experience variations of as much as /spl plusmn/2 dB when the other end is moved by a fraction of a wavelength.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bilateral averaging over receiving and transmitting areas for accurate measurements of sector average signal strength inside buildings","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.384195","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/8717/00384195.pdf","startPage":"508","endPage":"512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.384195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8717","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=384195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/384195/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Bilateral averaging over receiving and transmitting areas for accurate measurements of sector average signal strength inside buildings","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4969312","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bilateral averaging over receiving and transmitting areas for accurate measurements of sector average signal strength inside buildings","sourcePdf":"00384195.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039172S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"36","articleId":"384195","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":384201,"authors":[{"name":"B.D.

The plant is an unknown feedback-linearizable discrete-time system, represented by an input-output model. To derive the linearizing-stabilizing feedback control, a (possibly nonminimal) state-space model of the plant is obtained. This model is used to define the zero dynamics, which are assumed to be stable, i.e., the system is assumed to be minimum phase. A linearizing feedback control is derived in terms of some unknown nonlinear functions. A layered neural network is used to model the unknown system and generate the feedback control. Based on the error between the plant output and the model output, the weights of the neural network are updated. A local convergence result is given. The result says that, for any bounded initial conditions of the plant, if the neural network model contains enough number of nonlinear hidden neurons and if the initial guess of the network weights is sufficiently close to the correct weights, then the tracking error between the plant output and the reference command will converge to a bounded ball, whose size is determined by a dead-zone nonlinearity. Computer simulations verify the theoretical result.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/8718/00384214.pdf","startPage":"791","endPage":"801","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/9.384214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.384214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8718","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=384214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive control of a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Control systems","Signal processing algorithms","Feedback control","Convergence","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Error correction","Nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","nonlinear control systems","linearisation techniques","discrete time systems","state-space methods","self-adjusting systems","feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear self-tuning adaptive control","discrete-time systems","neural networks","unknown feedback-linearizable discrete-time system","input-output model","linearizing-stabilizing feedback control","state-space model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/384214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive control of a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems using neural networks","volume":"40","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4959081","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive control of a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00384214.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027354S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"422","articleId":"384214","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":384218,"authors":[{"name":"U.

A game theory approach to the latter tracking problems is presented where, given a specific reference signal, the controllers play against nature which can choose any initial state and any bounded energy disturbance input and measurement noise.

Small gain techniques can be applied to such systems to derive robust time-invariant controllers. Yet, this approach is often overly conservative when the parameters /spl theta/ undergo large variations during system operation. In general, higher performance can be achieved by control laws that incorporate available measurements of /spl theta/ and therefore \"adjust\" to the current plant dynamics. This paper discusses extensions of H/sub /spl infin// synthesis techniques to allow for controller dependence on time-varying but measured parameters. When this dependence is linear fractional, the existence of such gain-scheduled H/sub /spl infin// controllers is fully characterized in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The underlying synthesis problem is therefore a convex program for which efficient optimization techniques are available. The formalism and derivation techniques developed here apply to both the continuous- and discrete-time problems. Existence conditions for robust time-invariant controllers are recovered as a special case, and extensions to gain-scheduling in the face of parametric uncertainty are discussed. In particular, simple heuristics are proposed to compute such controllers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8718","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/8718/00384219.pdf","doi":"10.1109/9.384219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.384219","startPage":"853","endPage":"864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A convex characterization of gain-scheduled H/sub /spl infin// controllers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/384219/","displayDocTitle":"A convex characterization of gain-scheduled H/sub /spl infin// controllers","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4959086","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A convex characterization of gain-scheduled H/sub /spl infin// controllers","sourcePdf":"00384219.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04618S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"924","articleId":"384219","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":384241,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

True value simulation is performed for a sample of vector pairs chosen randomly from the test set. Transition probabilities and observabilities are estimated from the simulation data. These allow us to estimate fault detection probabilities per vector pair. Fault models considered are the transition faults, path delay faults, and the longest path delay faults. We analyze the vector sampling error and find a high-confidence lower bound for the detection probability that is used to compute the fault coverage for the entire vector set. Experimental results show that vector sampling can provide a close approximation to other methods. It requires reduced computing resources compared to other statistical methods.

The PVL algorithm has significantly superior numerical stability, while retaining the same efficiency as algorithms that compute the Pade approximation directly through moment matching, such as AWE and its derivatives. As a consequence, it produces more accurate and higher-order approximations, and it renders unnecessary many of the heuristics that AWE and its derivatives had to employ. The algorithm also computes an error bound that permits to identify the true poles and zeros of the original network.

Knowledge of the SAW properties of the layered structure is critical for the optimum and accurate design of such devices. The acoustic properties of ZnO films sputtered on {001}-cut <110>-propagating GaAs substrates are investigated in this article, including SAW velocity, effective piezoelectric coupling constant, propagation loss, diffraction, velocity surface, and reflectivity of shorted and open metallic gratings. The measurements of these essential SAW properties for the frequency range between 180 and 360 MHz have been performed using a knife-edge laser probe for film thicknesses over the range of 1.6-4 /spl mu/m and with films of different grain sizes. The high quality of dc triode sputtered films was observed as evidenced by high K/sup 2/ and low attenuation. The measurements of the velocity surface, which directly affects the SAW diffraction, on the bare and metalized ZnO on SiO/sub 2/ or Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/ on {001}-cut GaAs samples are reported using two different techniques: 1) knife-edge laser probe, 2) line-focus-beam scanning acoustic microscope. It was found that near the <110> propagation direction, the focusing SAW property of the bare GaAs changes into a nonfocusing one for the layered structure, but a reversed phenomenon exists near the <100> direction. Furthermore, to some extent the diffraction of the substrate can be controlled with the film thickness. The reflectivity of shorted and open gratings are also analyzed and measured. Zero reflectivity is observed for a shorted grating. There is good agreement between the measured data and theoretical values.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.384443","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/8722/00384443.pdf","startPage":"351","endPage":"361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.384443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ZnO films on {001}-cut <110>-propagating GaAs substrates for surface acoustic wave device applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=384443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/384443/","displayDocTitle":"ZnO films on {001}-cut <110>-propagating GaAs substrates for surface acoustic wave device applications","volume":"42","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4964942","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ZnO films on {001}-cut <110>-propagating GaAs substrates for surface acoustic wave device applications","sourcePdf":"384443.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047377S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"21","articleId":"384443","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":384444,"authors":[{"name":"H.

As opposed to previous treatments of the effect of the beam-vessel angle on the received acoustic signal, a wideband signal is transmitted and the returned signal in each sample volume is analyzed. High-resolution experimental M-mode images of radio-frequency (rf) echo signals are used to visualize the flow in individual regions of interest. These experiments confirm the predictions of a theoretical model for the signal and its second moment. It is shown that the two major effects limiting the correlated signal interval are the spread of axial velocities within the sample volume and the transit time across the lateral beam width. Particularly for small beam-vessel angles, the spread of velocities limits the correlated signal interval. In addition, the experimental results demonstrate that accurate velocity estimation for low volume flow rates and particularly for large beam-vessel angles may involve detection of changes in the correlation magnitude. For low volume flow rates, the shape of the correlation surface can be affected by small regions of blood with a strong scattering intensity located near the initial region of interest.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/384452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4964951","volume":"42","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effect of the beam-vessel angle on the received acoustic signal from blood","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of the beam-vessel angle on the received acoustic signal from blood","sourcePdf":"384452.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043338S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"16","articleId":"384452","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":384453,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Array apertures are synthesized using an active multi-element receive subaperture and a multi-element transmit subaperture defocused to emulate a single-element spatial response with high acoustic power. Echo signals are recorded independently by individual elements of the receive subaperture. Each method uses different spatial frequencies and acquisition strategies for imaging, and therefore different sets of active transmit/receive element combinations. Following acquisition, image points are reconstructed using the complete data set with full dynamic focus on both transmit and receive. Various factors affecting image quality have been evaluated and compared to conventional imagers through measurements with a 3.5 MHz, 128-element transducer array on different gel phantoms. Multielement synthetic aperture methods achieve higher electronic signal to noise ratio and better contrast resolution than conventional synthetic aperture techniques, approaching conventional phased array performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthetic aperture imaging for small scale systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.384453","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/8722/00384453.pdf","startPage":"429","endPage":"442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.384453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8722","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=384453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/384453/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","displayDocTitle":"Synthetic aperture imaging for small scale systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4964952","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthetic aperture imaging for small scale systems","sourcePdf":"384453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053026S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"411","articleId":"384453","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":384514,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Signal validation is generally performed by like-sensor comparisons (direct redundancy). When the increase of sensors is impossible, one uses in preference analytical redundancy. Analytical redundancy refers to the physical relationships, such as conservation of mass or conservation of energy, that exist among the many variables being measured in a system. These validation techniques must be implemented to increase systems reliability and to facilitate detection of failures. This paper presents several methods of detection and location of measurement failures using or not models of the process. For the model-based approach the authors present the standardized imbalance residuals analysis and the standardized least square residuals; usually, these techniques are presented by using linear models and here the authors extend to non-linear models.

Two solutions to represent time in neural networks are presented: the spatial representation and the dynamic representation. The model proposed, which uses the dynamic representation of time, is based on recurrent connections. By adding to each input neuron a self-recurrent connection it is proved that a network composed of such input neurons and binary output neurons is able to learn perfectly simple temporal sequences. The learning algorithm is based on a gradient descent of an error defined for binary neurons. This neural network is used for process fault detection and particularly in manufacturing systems in which sequence recognition is done both on the nature of the events and on their temporal constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1993.384900","startPage":"375","endPage":"380 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference - SMC","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1993.384900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8733","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference - SMC","pdfPath":"/iel2/3093/8733/00384900.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal sequence learning with neural networks for process fault detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/384900/","displayDocTitle":"Temporal sequence learning with neural networks for process fault detection","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4911008","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal sequence learning with neural networks for process fault detection","confLoc":"Le Touquet, France","sourcePdf":"00384900.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057866S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3093","citationCount":"3","articleId":"384900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":384905,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong Binglin","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Zhong Binglin","id":"37087588008"},{"name":"Yan Tinghu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yan Tinghu","id":"37087588554"},{"name":"Huang Ren","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Huang Ren","id":"37087585312"},{"name":"J.A.

Using fuzzy rules defined for each class, input data are directly classified without use of the neural network.

Efficient neural-based approaches for both kinds of situations are proposed in this paper. When geometrical knowledge is available, the weights and structure of the neural networks are constrained according to the geometry of the array. When statistical information is available, neural networks which optimize a statistical criterion (namely the measure of dependence) are developed.

Further, the paper provides a mathematical framework for achieving reasonable generalization properties via an appropriate training algorithm (supervised decision-directed learning) with a structure that provides acceptable knowledge representations of the data, The concepts and methods presented in the paper are illustrated through one practical example from medical diagnosis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1993.384948","startPage":"645","endPage":"650 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference - SMC","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1993.384948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8733","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference - SMC","pdfPath":"/iel2/3093/8733/00384948.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network based approach to knowledge acquisition and expert systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/384948/","displayDocTitle":"A neural network based approach to knowledge acquisition and expert systems","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4897169","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network based approach to knowledge acquisition and expert systems","confLoc":"Le Touquet, France","sourcePdf":"00384948.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033276S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3093","citationCount":"2","articleId":"384948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":385056,"authors":[{"name":"B.

When the surface of the dielectric is assumed to coincide with the surface of the cells designated as dielectric cells, then Yee's FDTD obtains the RCS of a larger cube than expected. It is shown that a cell size adjustment of a half-cell on all the cube surfaces approximately corrects the computed RCS. A better correction is obtained by rederiving the equation used to update the tangential components of the electric field at the surface of the cube.

It not only possesses the versatility of any time domain method but also offers the speed and accuracy of most other analytical techniques. Since a two-dimensional lattice is used as the computational space, the required CPU time and RAM space can be kept affordable even for a personal computer. Two examples of its application are presented. The first is the problem of the hollow rectangular waveguide, for which the analytical solution is readily available. The second is the solution of a more complex case, a boxed microstrip line on sapphire which can be considered as an inhomogeneous anisotropic guided wave structure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3094/8735/00385331.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"363 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.1993.385331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1993.385331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8735","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=385331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple mode analysis of waveguides using compact FDTD","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Lattices","Read-write memory","Microcomputers","Application software","Hollow waveguides","Rectangular waveguides","Microstrip","Anisotropic magnetoresistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rectangular waveguides","microstrip lines","dispersion (wave)","electromagnetic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis","computational complexity","sapphire"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact FDTD","dispersion analysis","guided wave structures","finite-difference time-domain","versatility","speed","accuracy","two-dimensional lattice","CPU time","RAM space","hollow rectangular waveguide","boxed microstrip line on sapphire"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/385331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1993-July 2 1993","displayDocTitle":"Multiple mode analysis of waveguides using compact FDTD","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4885095","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple mode analysis of waveguides using compact FDTD","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00385331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02648S","chronDate":"June 28 1993-July 2 1993","isNumber":"8735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3094","citationCount":"3","articleId":"385331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":385349,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The uniform sampling scheme, widely used in current applications, requires memory storage and computational complexity which increase very rapidly with the desired accuracy. In this work, to circumvent this difficulty for the case of large structures with localized isolated discontinuities, where higher accuracy (resolution) is required only over some specific parts, a nonuniform sampling scheme is presented. Although the proposed approach is more general, its application to Pocklington's equation is investigated here. The CG-FFT method for uniform sampling is applied to the radiation and scattering problem of a straight wire antenna, for a wide range of lengths.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonuniform sampling","Equations","Wire","Sampling methods","Matrix decomposition","Gradient methods","Scattering","Application software","Computational complexity","Green's function methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integral equations","conjugate gradient methods","fast Fourier transforms","computational complexity","wire antennas","electromagnetic wave scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient method","radiation problem","fast Fourier transform","storage","computational complexity","accuracy","localized isolated discontinuities","nonuniform sampling scheme","Pocklington's equation","scattering problem","straight wire antenna"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APS.1993.385398","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3094/8735/00385398.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"79 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1993.385398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CG-FFT method with nonuniform sampling for Pocklington's equation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=385398","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A CG-FFT method with nonuniform sampling for Pocklington's equation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/385398/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4885028","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1993-July 2 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CG-FFT method with nonuniform sampling for Pocklington's equation","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00385398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064915S","chronDate":"June 28 1993-July 2 1993","isNumber":"8735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3094","articleId":"385398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":385407,"authors":[{"name":"G.P.

The finite element method (FEM) is used on the scatterer and a small region enclosing it. At the boundary of this finite region the surface integral equation is used to impose boundary conditions on the electromagnetic field components. In the process of generating the FEM mesh a special scheme is used so that when integral equation boundary conditions are imposed the bandwidth of the matrix does not increase at random but leads to a well-structured matrix. This matrix is then solved using matrix partitioning techniques. Numerical results are presented; the E/sub /spl rho// and E/sub /spl phi// components of scattered field for a transverse electric (TE) wave incident at 45/spl deg/ to z-axis are shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3094/8735/00385545.pdf","startPage":"1772","endPage":"1775 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.1993.385545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1993.385545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8735","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=385545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scattering from dielectric cylinders: E/sub s/ formulation, using a combination of FEM and integral equation approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dielectrics","Electromagnetic scattering","Integral equations","Boundary conditions","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Finite element methods","Electromagnetic fields","Mesh generation","Bandwidth","Tellurium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","electromagnetic wave scattering","mesh generation","boundary integral equations","variational techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric cylinders","variational formulation","surface integral equations","scattering from arbitrary anisotropic cylinders","finite element method","boundary conditions","electromagnetic field components","mesh","matrix partitioning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/385545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1993-July 2 1993","displayDocTitle":"Scattering from dielectric cylinders: E/sub s/ formulation, using a combination of FEM and integral equation approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4978542","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scattering from dielectric cylinders: E/sub s/ formulation, using a combination of FEM and integral equation approach","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00385545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08379S","chronDate":"June 28 1993-July 2 1993","isNumber":"8735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3094","citationCount":"2","articleId":"385545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":385560,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This method, referred to as spread spectrum clock generation, or SSCG, is applicable to most microprocessor based systems. A unique waveform used to frequency modulate a digital clock signal results in a spectrum with sideband harmonics that are nearly uniform in amplitude when measured with an EMI receiver. This has the effect of spreading the energy of a discrete frequency harmonic over a wider bandwidth, thereby reducing the amplitudes of the harmonics. Attenuation as high as 13 dB is presented using an experimental setup, an actual SSCG integrated circuit, and theoretically computed results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel2/3095/8736/00385656.pdf","startPage":"227","endPage":"231","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.1994.385656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEMC.1994.385656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=385656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spread spectrum clock generation for the reduction of radiated emissions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Clocks","Frequency modulation","Microprocessors","Amplitude modulation","Digital modulation","Frequency measurement","Integrated circuit measurements","Electromagnetic interference","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","electromagnetic interference","clocks","interference suppression","frequency modulation","monolithic integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum clock generation","radiated emissions reduction","frequency modulation","FM","system clock","microprocessor based systems","digital clock signal","sideband harmonics","EMI receiver","discrete frequency harmonic","bandwidth","attenuation","experimental setup","integrated circuit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/385656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Spread spectrum clock generation for the reduction of radiated emissions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4868854","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-26 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spread spectrum clock generation for the reduction of radiated emissions","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00385656.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033194S","chronDate":"22-26 Aug 1994","isNumber":"8736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3095","citationCount":"174","articleId":"385656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":385679,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

One example is for radiation from slots, and the other is coupling of energy from a nonresonant aperture to an attached shielded cable that results in enhanced radiation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of the finite-difference time-domain method to radiation from shielded enclosures","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.1994.385679","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel2/3095/8736/00385679.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEMC.1994.385679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=385679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/385679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Application of the finite-difference time-domain method to radiation from shielded enclosures","conferenceDate":"22-26 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4868831","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the finite-difference time-domain method to radiation from shielded enclosures","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00385679.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046407S","chronDate":"22-26 Aug 1994","isNumber":"8736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3095","citationCount":"8","articleId":"385679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":385680,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This adaptive algorithm which uses as performance criterion the maximization of the array output power to adjust a phase angle, is developed and applied to antenna system in order to control automatically its directivity pattern.

For good conductors, where the wavelength decreases many orders of magnitude from its free-space size, and the fields are decaying exponentially, it becomes impractical to shrink the cell size so as to maintain linearity between cells. When the number of cells per wavelength criterion is violated at a boundary, FDTD will not yield correct estimates of reflection from, or transmission into, that boundary. The work presented details and provides validation for two approaches that can be used to achieve realistic results when modeling good conductors with FDTD using practical cell sizes. These approaches do not require modifications to the FDTD algorithms, and do not affect program execution times. Achieving accurate loss estimates will be of particular interest to those modeling resonant structures using FDTD.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/15.385885","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/8741/00385885.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.385885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling good conductors using the finite-difference, time-domain technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=385885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/385885/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling good conductors using the finite-difference, time-domain technique","volume":"37","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4969375","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling good conductors using the finite-difference, time-domain technique","sourcePdf":"00385885.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062081S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"19","articleId":"385885","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":385890,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The method is based on using a finite-difference technique to solve the time-domain MTL equations on the tubes, as well as the modified nodal analysis (MNA) formulation of the nonlinear lumped circuits in the junctions. The important consideration is the interface between the MTL and MNA regimes. This interface is accomplished via the first and last finite-difference current/voltage pair on each MTL of the network and, except for this, the two regimes are solved independently of each other. The advantage of the FDTD method is that the MTL equations may contain distributed source terms representing the coupling with an external field. We apply the method to previously published examples of multiconductor networks solved by other numerical methods, and the results agree exceptionally well. The case of an externally coupled field is also considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/8741/00385890.pdf","startPage":"252","endPage":"259","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/15.385890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.385890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8741","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=385890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The finite-difference time-domain solution of lossy MTL networks with nonlinear junctions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Network topology","Circuit topology","Partial differential equations","Voltage","Propagation losses","Multiconductor transmission lines","Coupling circuits","Electromagnetic fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission line theory","nonlinear network analysis","lumped parameter networks","finite difference time-domain analysis","network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-difference time-domain solution","lossy MTL networks","nonlinear junctions","numerical technique","lossy multiconductor transmission line","tube/junction networks","nonlinear lumped circuits","time-domain MTL equations","modified nodal analysis","interface","finite-difference current/voltage pair","FDTD method","distributed source","external field coupling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/385890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"The finite-difference time-domain solution of lossy MTL networks with nonlinear junctions","volume":"37","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4969380","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The finite-difference time-domain solution of lossy MTL networks with nonlinear junctions","sourcePdf":"00385890.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077241S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"25","articleId":"385890","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":385891,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In the analysis, we employ, as a model of the impulsive noise, Middleton's (1977) model labeled class A. First, the statistical characteristics of the in-phase and quadrature components of the impulsive noise are investigated, and it is proved that, in contrast to Gaussian noise, these components are dependent especially for the impulsive noise with small impulsive indices. Next, with consideration of the dependence between the in-phase and quadrature components of the noise, the performance of QAM systems with the conventional receiver designed for Gaussian noise is analyzed. The numerical results show that the performance is much worse than that achieved under Gaussian noise. Moreover, we show the design of the maximum likelihood receiver for class A impulsive noise and the great performance improvement by this receiver is confirmed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/15.385891","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/8741/00385891.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.385891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8741","startPage":"260","endPage":"267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of QAM systems under class A impulsive noise environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=385891","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of QAM systems under class A impulsive noise environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/385891/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4969381","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of QAM systems under class A impulsive noise environment","sourcePdf":"00385891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035215S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"85","articleId":"385891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":385902,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The NADC portables require a linear power amplifier for the spectrally efficient linear modulation scheme, /spl pi//4-DQPSK. It is well known that these PA's can exhibit non-linear characteristics that degrade system performance. System degradation is measured using bit error rate (BER) as the figure of merit. The PA is modeled by its AM-AM and AM-PM characteristics; the receiver architecture contains the simple, yet robust, differential detector. Simulation results are presented for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), Rayleigh fading, and frequency selective fading environments, and compared to results for a truly linear PA. In addition, PA spectral regrowth is discussed as well as the potential use of a linearization technique to compensate for the PA effects.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/385912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4964067","volume":"44","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of non-linear transmit power amplifiers for North American digital cellular portables","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of non-linear transmit power amplifiers for North American digital cellular portables","sourcePdf":"00385912.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043342S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"27","articleId":"385912","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":385913,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A channel (or resource) is a fixed frequency bandwidth (FDMA), a specific time-slot within a frame (TDMA), or a particular code (CDMA), depending on the multiple access technique used. A cost function has been defined by which the optimum channel to be assigned on demand can be selected. In addition, a suitable mobility model has been derived to determine the effects of handovers on network performance. The performance of the proposed DCA technique has been derived by computer simulations in terms of call blocking and handover failure probabilities.

Results have shown that 20/spl lambda/ separation in the horizontal plane or 15/spl lambda/ in the vertical plane is sufficient to obtain a cross-correlation of less than 0.7 for most of the time at 1800 MHz. Similar cross-correlation results were obtained for polarization diversity. When the antenna is inclined at 45/spl deg/, a 6 dB degradation in signal level was recorded for space diversity schemes. However, the diversify gain is unaffected by tilt and remains unchanged at 5-6 dB for horizontal and 3.5-4.5 dB for vertical separation. For polarization diversity, only a little degradation is experienced because most of the energy lost on the vertical branch is recovered on the horizontal branch. The diversity gain is between 1-2 dB at 0/spl deg/ tilt and increases to 3-5.2 dB at 45/spl deg/.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.385925","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/8742/00385925.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.385925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An experimental evaluation of the performance of two-branch space and polarization diversity schemes at 1800 MHz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=385925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/385925/","displayDocTitle":"An experimental evaluation of the performance of two-branch space and polarization diversity schemes at 1800 MHz","volume":"44","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4964080","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental evaluation of the performance of two-branch space and polarization diversity schemes at 1800 MHz","sourcePdf":"00385925.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062162S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"183","articleId":"385925","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":385926,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Multitone transmission is proposed because the associated larger symbol duration is favorable to combat the effects of multipath propagation. The multiple access capability of the system is achieved by means of DS/SS which also helps to combat the presence of several paths. On the other hand, DS/SS is also attractive to decrease the multiple access interference. The performance of this system is investigated for a multipath, slowly Rician fading and frequency selective channel, and a suboptimal receiver based on matched filters. The multiple access interference is also taken into account, A model for the computation of the bit error probability is derived for QPSK modulation of the orthogonal tones by the spread symbols. The system performance is investigated for selection diversity and maximal ratio combining (RAKE reception). Then the influence of the number of tones is investigated for given bandwidth, bit rate and transmission power. The positive effect of a multitone spread spectrum transmission is demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.385926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/8742/00385926.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.385926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multitone spread spectrum multiple access communications system in a multipath Rician fading channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/385926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Multitone spread spectrum multiple access communications system in a multipath Rician fading channel","volume":"44","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4964081","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multitone spread spectrum multiple access communications system in a multipath Rician fading channel","sourcePdf":"00385926.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049751S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"174","articleId":"385926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":385927,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

Even so, the adaptive filter can be rather efficient because during the hopping interval, while the jamming signal parameters are constant, the filter adjusts its weights; and if the hopping rate is not too high, there are time periods when the interfering signal is suppressed. In order to have a better insight into the performance of these systems, we analyze the DS spread spectrum receiver behavior, when the jamming signal frequency is continuously changing (chirp signal). We find that this is a reasonable step for a jammer that is trying to be more efficient. In such a case, a two-sided filter structure shows worse overall performance than a prediction error structure. As the jamming frequency sweeping rate or bandwidth is increased, the system performance is degraded. The analysis provides an insight into how much the system performance will be degraded as a function of the interfering (frequency sweeping) signal parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/8743/00385934.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.385934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.385934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8743","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=385934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rejection of frequency sweeping signal in DS spread spectrum systems using complex adaptive filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Spread spectrum communication","Jamming","Adaptive filters","Degradation","Interference","Signal analysis","Performance analysis","System performance","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","jamming","adaptive filters","filtering theory","frequency hop communication","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency sweeping signal rejection","DS spread spectrum systems","complex adaptive filters","narrowband interference adaptive filtering","frequency hopped jamming signal","CW interference","adaptive filter","jamming signal parameters","hopping rate","interfering signal suppression","system performance","DS spread spectrum receiver","chirp signal","jamming signal frequency","two-sided filter structure","prediction error structure","bandwidth","sweeping rate","signal parameters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/385934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Rejection of frequency sweeping signal in DS spread spectrum systems using complex adaptive filters","volume":"43","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4871802","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rejection of frequency sweeping signal in DS spread spectrum systems using complex adaptive filters","sourcePdf":"00385934.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055566S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"24","articleId":"385934","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":385939,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Hybrid CDMA/FDMA combines two schemes in such a way that the resulting hybrid network is robust against interference and is much more spectrally efficient than a CDMA system. Several possible architectures are introduced for the hybrid CDMA/FDMA subcarrier fiber optic local area network (LAN). The networks utilize CDMA and SCM, an asynchronous multiple access scheme. Direct sequence spread spectrum multiple access (DS/SSMA), the most common form of CDMA is employed. It is shown that by using the code sequence sets for which the shift-and-add property holds, intermodulation products (IMPs) and harmonics have a similar interference-like effect as nonmatching sequences do. Owing to the fact that the shift-and-add property holds for conventional spreading sequences, suppression of nonlinear distortions is examined. An average error probability performance evaluation of the selected configuration is presented for a transceiver pair. In analysis of the system, the authors assume the interference term arising from other users is Gaussian distributed. The results are compared to that obtained by exact evaluation of interference distribution using Gauss quadrature rule integration method. The authors compare the performance of this scheme for two different code sequence lengths. They also present some preliminary experimental results on the proposed LAN implementation as well as its measured transmission performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.385940","startPage":"75","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/8743/00385940.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.385940","endPage":"87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A subcarrier multiplexed CDM optical local area network, theory and experiment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/385940/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"A subcarrier multiplexed CDM optical local area network, theory and experiment","volume":"43","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4871796","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A subcarrier multiplexed CDM optical local area network, theory and experiment","sourcePdf":"00385940.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029069S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","articleId":"385940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":385946,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Dong Yao","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yu-Dong Yao","id":"38230308400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"385946","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":159},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=385946","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic repeat request","Error analysis","Throughput","Transmitters","Error probability","State estimation","Delay","Switches","Communication switching","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","error statistics","time-varying channels","channel capacity","parameter estimation","signal detection","error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["go-back-N ARQ scheme","variable-error-rate channels","nonstationary channels","channel state","operation mode","throughput"]}],"abstract":"In nonstationary channels, error rates vary considerably.

Computer simulations demonstrate that the proposed detectors give a much smaller symbol error probability than the LMF when the noise has an impulsive component and produces only a slight performance degradation in the case of pure Gaussian noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/8743/00385950.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.385950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.385950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8743","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=385950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matched median filter for detecting QAM signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Signal detection","Working environment noise","Gaussian noise","Noise robustness","Computer simulation","Detectors","Error probability","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature amplitude modulation","signal detection","Gaussian noise","white noise","matched filters","filtering theory","median filters","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QAM signal detection","matched median filter","complex matched median filter","impulsive type noise","linear matched filter","noise environments","computer simulations","symbol error probability","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/385950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Matched median filter for detecting QAM signals","volume":"43","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4871786","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matched median filter for detecting QAM signals","sourcePdf":"00385950.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027591S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","articleId":"385950","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":385951,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

The emphasis of First Sight is on the analysis of motion information gathered solely from the outline of a moving human object. Two main processes are implemented in First Sight. The first process uses a novel technique to extract the outline of a moving human body from an image sequence. The second process, which employs a new human body model, interprets the outline and produces a labeled two-dimensional human body stick figure for each frame of the image sequence. Extensive knowledge of the structure, shape, and posture of the human body is used in the model. The experimental results of applying the technique on unedited image sequences with self-occlusions and missing boundary lines are encouraging.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.385981","startPage":"359","endPage":"377","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/8745/00385981.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.385981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"First Sight: A human body outline labeling system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Labeling","Image sequences","Biological system modeling","Machine vision","Image motion analysis","Information analysis","Motion analysis","Data mining","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sequences","biomechanics","motion estimation","edge detection","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["First Sight","human body outline labeling system","moving human body","image sequence","labeled two-dimensional human body stick figure","shape","posture","self-occlusions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/385981/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"First Sight: A human body outline labeling system","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4942725","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"First Sight: A human body outline labeling system","sourcePdf":"00385981.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049741S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"120","articleId":"385981","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":386007,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

The various architectures of this class differ only in the design of their routing networks, which could be systolic, semisystolic, or RAM-based. These architectures compute the Recursive Pyramid Algorithm, which is a reformulation of Mallat's pyramid algorithm for the DWT. The DWT is computed in real time (running DWT), using just N/sub w/(J-1) cells of storage, where N/sub w/ is the length of the filter and J is the number of octaves. They are ideally suited for single-chip implementation due to their practical I/O rate, small storage, and regularity. The N-point 1-D DWT is computed in 2N cycles. The period can be reduced to N cycles by using N/sub w/ extra MAC's. Our architectures are shown to be optimal in both computation time and in area. A utilization of 100% is achieved for the linear array. Extensions of our architecture for computing the M-band DWT are discussed. Also, two architectures for computing the 2-D DWT (separable case) are discussed. One of these architectures, based on a combination of systolic and parallel filters, computes the N/sup 2/-point 2-D DWT, in real time, in N/sup 2/+N cycles, using 2NN/sub w/ cells of storage.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI architectures for the discrete wavelet transform","doi":"10.1109/82.386170","startPage":"305","endPage":"316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.386170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/8754/00386170.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=386170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/386170/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"VLSI architectures for the discrete wavelet transform","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4971297","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI architectures for the discrete wavelet transform","sourcePdf":"00386170.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04857S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"217","articleId":"386170","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":386175,"authors":[{"name":"Jiun-In Guo","affiliation":["Computer & Communication Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jiun-In Guo","id":"37277255400"},{"name":"Chi-Min Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Min Liu","id":"37351136400"},{"name":"Chein-Wei Jen","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chein-Wei Jen","id":"37267413900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7130"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-125X"}],"articleNumber":"386175","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, a coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC)-based array architecture is presented for computing the multidimensional (M-D) discrete Hartley transform (DHT). Since the kernel of the M-D DHT is inseparable, the M-D DHT problems cannot be computed through the 1-D DHT's directly. Bracewell et al. have presented an algorithm for the M-D DHT through the 1-D DHT's. The existing hardware architectures have been designed using this algorithm. However, the postprocessing required in the algorithm leads to high hardware overhead. This paper presents a new algorithm to compute M-D DHT through a special 1-D transform which is derived through considering both the separable computation and the efficient implementation with CORDIC architectures. This algorithm provides a direct way to compute the M-D DHT separably through 1-D transforms with simpler postprocessing than that in Bracewell's approach. Also, the algorithm exploits the symmetry of the triangular functions to reduce the computational complexity. Using this algorithm, we design an array architecture for the M-D DHT. This architecture features a systolic computing style, PE's with a CORDIC structure, low I/O cost, and the encapsulated new M-D DHT algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multidimensional systems","Discrete transforms","Signal processing algorithms","DH-HEMTs","Computer architecture","Hardware","Discrete Fourier transforms","Kernel","Computational complexity","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hartley transforms","digital arithmetic","systolic arrays","parallel algorithms","computational complexity","signal processing","digital signal processing chips","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CORDIC-based array architecture","multidimensional discrete Hartley transform","coordinate rotation digital computer","multidimensional DHT","1D transform","postprocessing","triangular functions","computational complexity","systolic computing style","DSP chip","VLSI implementation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=386175","doi":"10.1109/82.386175","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/8754/00386175.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.386175","startPage":"349","endPage":"355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel CORDIC-based array architecture for the multidimensional discrete Hartley transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel CORDIC-based array architecture for the multidimensional discrete Hartley transform","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/386175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","volume":"42","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4971301","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel CORDIC-based array architecture for the multidimensional discrete Hartley transform","sourcePdf":"00386175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043246S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"9","articleId":"386175","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":386181,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Since existing strategies characterize modules for purely random inputs, they fail to account for the effect of signal statistics on switching activity. The dual bit type (DBT) model, however, accounts not only for the random activity of the least significant bits (LSB's), but also for the correlated activity of the most significant bits (MSB's), which contain two's-complement sign information. The resulting model is parameterizable in terms of complexity factors such as word length and can be applied to a wide variety of modules ranging from adders, shifters, and multipliers to register files and memories. Since the model operates at the register transfer level (RTL), it is orders of magnitude faster than gate- or circuit-level tools, but while other architecture-level techniques often err by 50-100% or more, the DBT method offers error rates on the order of 10-15%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/92.386219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/8756/00386219.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.386219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architectural power analysis: The dual bit type method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/386219/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","displayDocTitle":"Architectural power analysis: The dual bit type method","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4977985","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architectural power analysis: The dual bit type method","sourcePdf":"00386219.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041174S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"8756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"247","articleId":"386219","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":386223,"authors":[{"name":"B.A.A.

Design methods compatible across the analog-digital boundaries would expedite the design process, and in this paper we address analog high-level design issues. An approach for systems-level synthesis of a class of analog systems is presented. A behavioral level for the analog domain is characterized in terms of state equations and transfer functions in the continuous and discrete domains. State-space representations are generated from transfer function specifications that exhibit system level characteristics such as controllability and observability as, well as decoupled and parallel architectures. These state-space representations are synthesized into behavioral-level, technology-independent architectures composed of analog functional components. An intermediate architecture in a circuit implementation technology is synthesized from the behavioral architecture. The various algorithmic procedures for synthesis are implemented in the program ARCHGEN. Behavioral simulation is used for architecture verification and design space exploration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/92.386223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.386223","endPage":"244","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/8756/00386223.pdf","startPage":"231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ARCHGEN: Automated synthesis of analog systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/386223/","displayDocTitle":"ARCHGEN: Automated synthesis of analog systems","volume":"3","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4977989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ARCHGEN: Automated synthesis of analog systems","sourcePdf":"00386223.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054029S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"8756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"51","articleId":"386223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":386226,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Optimization for reconvergent paths and duplication of logic can be automatically considered during the sweeping procedure. Experimental results show that our approach is very promising.

Since in most consumer electronics, and more specifically for hearing instruments, the usable volume is decreasing very rapidly, maximum miniaturization is achieved by using flip-chips. In order to avoid open circuits during reflow soldering of all other components, a high melting soldering process is required for the bonding of the IC's. An additional advantage of the AuSn process is that the bumps do not completely melt, and a certain stand-off height is guaranteed. The bumps are deposited on top of the band pads and are bonded to copper tracks on a polyimide foil. The required tin is either deposited on the bump or on the copper tracks. Both AuSn soldering processes are performed by using pulsed heat thermode (gang) bonding. It has been found that the quality of the bonds depends on the microstructure formed in the bonding region. Energy dispersed X-ray analysis (EDX) measurements indicate that eutectic (80/20) Au-Sn or /spl xi/' phases are required for good quality bonds. To obtain these phases, the temperature at the interface and the initial amount of tin are optimized. As a consequence of a large thermal mismatch and a small stand-off height of the IC, the number of cycles to failure during temperature shock experiments is limited. The results are remarkably improved (by a factor of 20) by using an epoxy-based underfill material.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/386258/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","publicationDate":"May 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4967904","volume":"18","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reliable Au-Sn flip-chip bonding on flexible prints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable Au-Sn flip-chip bonding on flexible prints","sourcePdf":"00386258.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050085S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"96","citationCount":"24","articleId":"386258","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":386263,"authors":[{"name":"H.L.

This paper discusses the use of conductive adhesives as a replacement for solder on SMT-printed circuit boards. As a result of a world-wide market survey, a number of conductive adhesives have been selected. The key issue of this paper has been to uncover the market for adhesive types and their composition, as well as the technical investigation of the influence of component termination and printed-circuit surface types on adhesive bonding stability. Four different types of adhesives on two different metal surfaces are compared with conventional solder technology. Each adhesive has been applied to the PCB's by either screen printing or dispensing according to the manufacturer's recommendation, followed by curing. All PCB's went through thermal and humidity cycling followed by electrical measurements of resistance; all variants have been adhesion tested. All adhesive variants have been microsectioned for metallurgical and microstructure examination. Energy Dispersive Analysis of X-ray (EDAX) of the metal particles in the adhesive has been carried out and documented. Rework of conductive joints is briefly addressed. Finally, aspects of occupational health are discussed concerning work with adhesive types. Work with epoxy-based adhesives has been brought into special focus.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/96.386263","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","pdfPath":"/iel4/96/8757/00386263.pdf","startPage":"284","endPage":"291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/96.386263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conductive adhesives for SMT and potential applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/386263/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Conductive adhesives for SMT and potential applications","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4967908","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conductive adhesives for SMT and potential applications","sourcePdf":"00386263.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032155S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"96","citationCount":"21","articleId":"386263","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":386264,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

However, the long-term behavior of conductive adhesive joints under various climatic conditions shows large variations with the type of adhesive and metallization used and needs further clarification. In this paper electrical and mechanical behavior of conductive adhesives are discussed for bonding R 1206 jumpers with SnPb or AgPd terminations on bare copper, SnPb or Au plated boards, both directly after bonding and after climate testing (damp heat, hot storage, and rapid change of temperature). The influence of the component terminations is found to be dominant. AgPd terminations show only small increase in contact resistance.

A similar level of scrutiny that is used to evaluate contact resistance performance for interconnections made with solder and separable connectors is necessary for electrically conductive adhesives. Experience with solder interconnection and separable connectors shows low initial contact resistance of less than 10 m/spl Omega/ when bulk conductor material is minimized in the measurement scheme. Stability is typically determined to be less than a 5-10 m/spl Omega/ change as a function of stress. The main intent of this study is to characterize the electrical contact resistance performance of joints made with isotropic electrically conductive adhesives. A copper comb pattern test vehicle was designed and fabricated using 0.25-mm thick lead frame material. The plating finishes that were applied to the copper substrate included a palladium alloy, gold, tin, and nickel. Test samples were made with several electrically conductive adhesives. Samples consisted of two comb patterns bonded to each other making a gang of 40 lap joints. Variables from circuit packaging such as coefficient of thermal expansion mismatches are purposely avoided in this study. Contact resistance measurements were made initially and as a function of time during environmental tests. Stresses included thermal cycling, thermal aging, and temperature and humidity conditioning. The stability of electrical contact resistance is shown to be influenced by both plating metallurgy and the conductive adhesive itself. Contact resistance equivalent to solder is possible with some electrically conductive adhesives on appropriate metallurgical finishes. Mechanically, adhesive joints are less robust than solder joints, and therefore care must be taken to eliminate or minimize the effects of mechanical loading.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/96.386265","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","pdfPath":"/iel4/96/8757/00386265.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/96.386265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of contact resistance for isotropic electrically conductive adhesives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/386265/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of contact resistance for isotropic electrically conductive adhesives","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4967910","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of contact resistance for isotropic electrically conductive adhesives","sourcePdf":"00386265.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046143S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"96","citationCount":"58","articleId":"386265","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":386266,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

Six different isotropically conductive, silver-loaded epoxies were evaluated for the surface mount process. These adhesives were used to attach electrically and mechanically 160-lead, 25-mil pitch, quad flat package (QFP) and 0805 chip components on PCB's with hash gold, passivated copper, and tin/lead metallization. The reliability of the conductive adhesive joints was evaluated in two types of environmental test: constant humidity at 60/spl deg/C and 90% RH for 1000 h, and temperature cycling for 1000 h from -40/spl deg/C to 85/spl deg/C. Under these conditions, both the electrical performance, in terms of contact resistance and surface insulation resistance (SIR), and the mechanical strength of the adhesive bonds were evaluated. The results show that reliable conductive adhesive joining can be achieved for both chip components and QFP components on PCB's with all three metallizations tested. Under well-controlled conditions, and with the right choice of adhesive for the application in mind, no significant increase or variation in electrical resistance during the temperature cycling test was encountered. The humidity exposure test was found to have a minor impact on both contact resistance and adhesion strength of most adhesives tested. In general. There was little difference between the different PCB metallizations used (except for SIR measurements). No evidence of silver migration could be observed after the humidity exposure for any of the adhesives tested.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8757","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","pdfPath":"/iel4/96/8757/00386266.pdf","doi":"10.1109/96.386266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/96.386266","startPage":"305","endPage":"312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability assessment of isotropically conductive adhesive joints in surface mount applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/386266/","displayDocTitle":"Reliability assessment of isotropically conductive adhesive joints in surface mount applications","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4967911","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability assessment of isotropically conductive adhesive joints in surface mount applications","sourcePdf":"00386266.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044527S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"96","citationCount":"33","articleId":"386266","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":386267,"authors":[{"name":"Johan Liu","affiliation":["The Swedish Institute of Production Engineering Research IVF, Molndal, Sweden"],"lastName":"Johan Liu","id":"37279469600"},{"name":"L.

Electroless Ni/Cu plating is a maskless low-cost approach to bumping directly on aluminum bondpads. An immersion tin layer for coating and soldering is plated on the copper. Due to the high alkalinity (pH>12) of electroless Cu baths, a thick Ni layer of about 7 /spl mu/m is required on the aluminum for seating. A shear strength of 180 cN and a contact resistance of less than 2 m/spl Omega/ for the bumps were obtained. Because of the high hardness of nickel, conventional gang bonding techniques are not applicable. The hardness of electroless copper is about 200 mHV/sub 25/, and after annealing in the range of 130-150 mHV/sub 25/ thermocompression gang bonding of Au plated tape to the Ni/Cu/Sn metallization was carried out. The average pull strength was 50 cN. The influences of the size and electroless solder plating of the deposited copper are also investigated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8757","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","pdfPath":"/iel4/96/8757/00386270.pdf","doi":"10.1109/96.386270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/96.386270","startPage":"334","endPage":"338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electroless nickel/copper plating as a new bump metallization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/386270/","displayDocTitle":"Electroless nickel/copper plating as a new bump metallization","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4967915","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electroless nickel/copper plating as a new bump metallization","sourcePdf":"00386270.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051239S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"96","citationCount":"21","articleId":"386270","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":386286,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.S.G.

The network is optimized through iterative addition and deletion of redundant connections. With the use of the connection fault model, the problem of identifying connections that can be made without affecting the network's functionality is converted into the problem of identifying redundant connection faults. Efficient test generation algorithms can thus be applied directly. Techniques that can efficiently locate redundant wires and/or nodes after adding a redundant wire are also proposed. Experiment results on MCNC benchmark circuits show that, on average, a 16% reduction in gate count and a 20% reduction in connection count can be achieved at a low computational cost. The suggested technique can also be applied for timing optimization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/EDAC.1993.386447","publicationTitle":"1993 European Conference on Design Automation with the European Event in ASIC Design","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 European Conference on Design Automation with the European Event in ASIC Design","pdfPath":"/iel2/3099/8762/00386447.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDAC.1993.386447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8762","startPage":"373","endPage":"377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-level logic optimization by redundancy addition and removal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=386447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-level logic optimization by redundancy addition and removal","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Feb 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/386447/","conferenceDate":"22-25 Feb. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4885199","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-level logic optimization by redundancy addition and removal","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00386447.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025261S","chronDate":"22-25 Feb 1993","isNumber":"8762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3099","citationCount":"57","articleId":"386447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":386449,"authors":[{"name":"P.E.

Approximate tree matching has applications in genetic sequence comparison, scene analysis, error recovery and correction in programming languages, and cluster analysis. Edit distance determination is a computationally intensive task, and the design of special purpose hardware could result in a significant speed up. This paper describes in detail a VLSI architecture for computing the edit distance between arbitrary ordered trees, based on a parallel, systolic realization of the dynamic programming algorithm proposed by S.Y. Lu (1979). This architecture represents a significant improvement over that described by Sastry and Ranganathan (1994), which restricted the type of trees that could be processed by it.

We have simulated the SPEC92 benchmarks on a statically scheduled quad-issue processor model, running code from the Multiflow compiler. Non-blocking loads and stream buffers both provide a significant performance advantage, and their combination performs significantly better than either alone. For example, with a 64-byte, 2-way set associative cache with 32 cycle fetch latency, non-blocking loads reduce the run-time by 21% while stream-buffers reduce it by 26%, and the combined use of the two yields a 47% reduction. The addition of speculative execution further improves the performance of the systems that we have simulated, with or without non-blocking loads and stream buffers, by an additional 20% to 4O%.

This paper presents the non-consistent dual register file, an alternative implementation and management of the register file. Non-consistent dual register files support the bandwidth demands and the high register requirements, penalizing neither access time nor implementation cost. The proposal is evaluated for software pipelined loops and compared against a unified register file. Empirical results show improvements on performance and a noticeable reduction of the density of memory traffic due to a reduction of the spill code. The spill code can in general increase the minimum initiation interval and decrease loop performance. Additional improvements can be obtained when the operations are scheduled having in mind the register file organization proposed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.1995.386558","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 1st IEEE Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 1st IEEE Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel2/3040/8763/00386558.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.1995.386558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8763","startPage":"22","endPage":"31","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-consistent dual register files to reduce register pressure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=386558","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-consistent dual register files to reduce register pressure","chronOrPublicationDate":"1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/386558/","conferenceDate":"22-25 Jan. 1995","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"4881194","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-consistent dual register files to reduce register pressure","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00386558.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03762S","chronDate":"1995","isNumber":"8763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3040","citationCount":"9","articleId":"386558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":386573,"authors":[{"name":"B.J.

Our paper provides an empirical investigation of the feasibility of transmitting real-time packet streams across a large extant campus network, the University of Virginia campus network. This network is representative of contemporary large enterprise networks consisting of Ethernet segments connected by high-performance routers to high-speed back-bones, e.g., FDDI rings. We focus on interactive packet voice. Delay and loss measurements are obtained for packet voice streams transmitted over three paths through the network.

The PSE causes some packets to experience latencies up to 100 times the average or to completely starve out due to 16 collisions. The PSE causes some packets to experience high delays at realistic offered loads as low as 40% and causes complete starvation of some packets at offered loads as low as 60%. The PSE makes CSMA/CD LANs unsuitable for real-time traffic except at offered loads much less than 100%. It is the limiting factor in the usable bandwidth of the bus. As an alternative to CSMA/CD, we present the fair dual distributed queue (FDDQ) algorithm. Under high load, FDDQ uses a single reservation mini-dot per packet and a tree-based collision resolution algorithm (CRA) to maintain two distributed queues of waiting senders. This provides two priority FCFS access to the network. FDDQ provides utilizations and average latencies very similar to those of CSMA/CD but is fair even at extremely high offered loads. The protocol is stable for a constant number of senders, is simple enough to be practical, should be implementable in firmware, and completely eliminates the PSE.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 19th Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/3026/8764/00386599.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"217","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 19th Conference on Local Computer Networks","doi":"10.1109/LCN.1994.386599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.1994.386599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8764","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=386599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The packet starvation effect in CSMA/CD LANs and a solution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Local area networks","Delay","Traffic control","Ethernet networks","Road accidents","Bandwidth","Access protocols","Microprogramming","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","local area networks","packet switching","distributed algorithms","optimisation","queueing theory","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet starvation effect","CSMA/CD LAN","solution","Ethernet controllers","latencies","delays","real-time traffic","usable bandwidth","limiting factor","fair dual distributed queue algorithm","single reservation mini-dot","tree-based collision resolution algorithm","protocol","firmware","FDDQ"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/386599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1994","displayDocTitle":"The packet starvation effect in CSMA/CD LANs and a solution","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4916903","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The packet starvation effect in CSMA/CD LANs and a solution","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00386599.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035599S","chronDate":"1994","isNumber":"8764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3026","citationCount":"10","articleId":"386599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":386835,"authors":[{"name":"Chow","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, Canada"],"lastName":"Chow","id":"37087538955"},{"name":"Serinken","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, Canada"],"lastName":"Serinken","id":"37087536096"},{"name":"Shlien","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, Canada"],"lastName":"Shlien","id":"37087539161"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1479-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"386835","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":44,"totalDownloads":89},"abstract":"A novel technique for protecting identification documents (ID) against forgery and tampering is described. A security seal is printed beside the photograph on the face of the ID card. The security seal has the dimensions of a postage stamp and contains encrypted information derived from the photograph as well as alphanumeric information normally found on an ID card. It is used to verify the legitimacy of the ID card. The verification station consists of a scanner interfaced to a personal computer. During the verification process, the card is placed on the scanner, which transfers a digital representation of the card image to the computer.

It is shown that two coupled quantum wells brought in resonance by an applied electric field will, due to the reduction in the exciton oscillator strengths, have a modulation of the refractive index which is more than one order of magnitude larger than in a similar quantum well structure based on the quantum confined Stark effect, but with no coupling between the quantum wells. Calculations show that combining this strong electrorefractive effect with self-photo-induced modulation in a biased-pin-diode modulator configuration, results in an optical nonlinearity with a figure of merit of 20 cm/sup 3//J at a wavelength of 1.55 /spl mu/m.

These include gain saturation, spontaneous emission, the gain-frequency relation, and the line-width enhancement factor. This new model replicates many of the published experimental results and also gives additional insight into the internal operation of the device. In particular, gain saturation combined with the standing waves created by colliding pulses within the saturable absorber produce a transient gain grating. This is found to have significant effects in locking either the even or the odd modes together in CPM. A performance comparison between CPM and SCPM is completed and some key design parameters of both configurations are explored.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.387042","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/8770/00387042.pdf","startPage":"1051","endPage":"1058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.387042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Dynamics of monolithic passively mode-locked semiconductor lasers","volume":"31","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4982480","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387042/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamics of monolithic passively mode-locked semiconductor lasers","sourcePdf":"00387042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042659S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"91","articleId":"387042","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":387066,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A high-bandwidth and low-power memory circuit design is the key technology to realize the IMAP-LSI. We adopted following new designs for memory circuit. (1) Memory access time is designed to be twice as fast as PE execution time (2) Employment of dynamic power control mode, which reduces the memory power consumption down to 30% of maximum power without a loss in access-speed (3) Simplified synchronization with PE's (4) 4-way block redundancy.

For this purpose, motion estimation and compensation techniques have been successfully applied. This paper studies motion estimation algorithms in the context of first generation coding techniques commonly used in digital TV. In this framework, estimating the motion in the scene is not an intrinsic goal. Motion estimation should indeed provide good temporal prediction and simultaneously require low overhead information. More specifically the aim is to minimize globally the bandwidth corresponding to both the prediction error information and the motion parameters. This paper first clarifies the notion of motion, reviews classical motion estimation techniques, and outlines new perspectives. Block matching techniques are shown to be the most appropriate in the framework of first generation coding. To overcome the drawbacks characteristic of most block matching techniques, this paper proposes a new locally adaptive multigrid block matching motion estimation technique. This algorithm has been designed taking into account the above aims. It leads to a robust motion field estimation precise prediction along moving edges and a decreased amount of side information in uniform areas. Furthermore, the algorithm controls the accuracy of the motion estimation procedure in order to optimally balance the amount of information corresponding to the prediction error and to the motion parameters. Experimental results show that the technique results in greatly enhanced visual quality and significant saving in terms of bit rate when compared to classical block matching techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387089/","volume":"83","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4990498","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Motion estimation techniques for digital TV: a review and a new contribution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion estimation techniques for digital TV: a review and a new contribution","sourcePdf":"387089.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084617S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"8772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"292","articleId":"387089","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":387092,"authors":[{"name":"R.

With the growing availability of digital transmission links, progress in signal processing, VLSI technology and image compression research, visual communications has become more feasible than ever. Digital video coding technology has developed into a mature field and a diversity of products has been developed-targeted for a wide range of emerging applications, such as video on demand, digital TV/HDTV broadcasting, and multimedia image/video database services. With the increased commercial interest in video communications the need for international image and video coding standards arose. Standardization of video coding algorithms holds the promise of large markets for video communication equipment. Interoperability of implementations from different vendors enables the consumer to access video from a wider range of services and VLSI implementations of coding algorithms conforming to international standards can be manufactured at considerably reduced costs. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of today's image and video coding standards and their role in video communications. The different coding algorithms developed for each standard are reviewed and the commonalities between the standards are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.387092","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/8772/00387092.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.387092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8772","startPage":"907","endPage":"924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital video coding standards and their role in video communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387092","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital video coding standards and their role in video communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387092/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"83","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4984212","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital video coding standards and their role in video communications","sourcePdf":"00387092.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095035S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"8772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"71","articleId":"387092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":387094,"authors":[{"name":"B.M.

The most important performance factors are efficient use of over-the-air spectrum, coverage versus quality, cost, interoperability, and the existence of a practical transition scenario. It is concluded that all receivers need not have the same peformance, and that low-cost receivers must be available for noncritical locations in the home. If this variation in price and performance is made possible by appropriate system design, then interoperability is facilitated and nondisruptive improvement over time is made possible, as desired by the Federal Communications Commission. In the second part of the paper, techniques that may permit meeting these requirements are discussed. These include joint multiresolution source and channel coding, multicarrier modulation, and hybrid analog/digital coding and transmission. The analog transform coefficients are subjected to spread-spectrum processing, and coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplex (COFDM) is applied to the complex hybrid symbols to be transmitted through the channel. Various methods of equalization and of improving noise, interference, and multipath rejection are compared. Finally, an example is given of a system that meets the various requirements by making use of a number of the techniques discussed. The system provides extended coverage, albeit at lower quality than currently proposed all-digital systems, and equal or higher quality than such systems in much of their service area. It also features self-optimization at each receiver depending on signal quality and receiver characteristics, and facilitates the design of receivers of lower cost and performance for less-critical applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/8772/00387095.pdf","startPage":"958","endPage":"981","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.387095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.387095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8772","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced television systems for terrestrial broadcasting: Some problems and some proposed solutions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["TV broadcasting","Costs","Pulp manufacturing","FCC","Signal resolution","Channel coding","Digital modulation","Modulation coding","Spread spectrum communication","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["television broadcasting","channel coding","source coding","spread spectrum communication","frequency division multiplexing","equalisers","multipath channels","television receivers","television interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced television systems","terrestrial broadcasting","interference","multipath rejection","self-optimization","regulatory authorities","over-the-air spectrum","performance factors","practical transition scenario","coverage versus quality","cost","interoperability","equalization","receivers","multiresolution source coding","channel coding","multicarrier modulation","hybrid analog/digital coding","noise","analog transform coefficients","spread-spectrum processing","coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplex"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","displayDocTitle":"Advanced television systems for terrestrial broadcasting: Some problems and some proposed solutions","volume":"83","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4990503","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced television systems for terrestrial broadcasting: Some problems and some proposed solutions","sourcePdf":"00387095.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102086S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"8772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"166","articleId":"387095","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":387096,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This digitization, which is already well advanced in many program production areas and transmission links, now has to be extended to complete the last link in the broadcast chain; i.e., from broadcast transmitter to consumer receivers. It is therefore necessary to develop wholly new techniques for the broadcasting of digitally coded TV programmes. Thus an efficient baseband digital coding must be combined with a robust digital modulation and channel coding scheme that can meet the requirements of every mode of broadcast reception. This article presents the research work related to the coded orthogonal frequency division multiplex (COFDM) technology, which has now been completed in the field of digital radio (DAB), and which is under progress in the field of digital terrestrial TV.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency division multiplexing","TV broadcasting","Broadcast technology","Production","Radio transmitters","Baseband","Robustness","Digital modulation","Channel coding","Radio broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital television","television broadcasting","digital communication","frequency division multiplexing","channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coded orthogonal frequency division multiplex","broadcasting networks","digitization","program production areas","transmission links","broadcast transmitter","consumer receivers","digitally coded TV programmes","baseband digital coding","digital modulation","channel coding scheme","broadcast reception","digital terrestrial TV","digital radio","COFDM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387096","doi":"10.1109/5.387096","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/8772/00387096.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.387096","startPage":"982","endPage":"996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8772","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded orthogonal frequency division multiplex [TV broadcasting]","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coded orthogonal frequency division multiplex [TV broadcasting]","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","volume":"83","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4990504","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded orthogonal frequency division multiplex [TV broadcasting]","sourcePdf":"00387096.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02461S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"8772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"538","articleId":"387096","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":387140,"authors":[{"name":"N.G.

To overcome the difficulties, wavelet-bases have been used previously which lead to a sparse matrix. The authors refer to \"MoM with wavelet bases\" as \"wavelet MoM\". There have been three different ways of applying the wavelet techniques to boundary integral equations: 1) wavelets on the entire real line which requires the boundary conditions to be enforced explicitly, 2) wavelet bases for the bounded interval obtained by periodizing the wavelets on the real line, and 3) \"wavelet-like\" basis functions. Furthermore, only orthonormal (ON) bases have been considered. The present authors propose the use of compactly supported semi-orthogonal (SO) spline wavelets specially constructed for the bounded interval in solving first-kind integral equations. They apply this technique to analyze a problem involving 2D EM scattering from metallic cylinders. It is shown that the number of unknowns in the case of wavelet MoM increases by m-1 as compared to conventional MoM, where m is the order of the spline function. Results for linear (m=2) and cubic (m=4) splines are presented along with their comparisons to conventional MoM results. It is observed that the use of cubic spline wavelets almost \"diagonalizes\" the matrix while maintaining less than 1.5% of relative normed error. The authors also present the explicit closed-form polynomial representation of the scaling functions and wavelets.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On solving first-kind integral equations using wavelets on a bounded interval","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.387178","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/8774/00387178.pdf","startPage":"614","endPage":"622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.387178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8774","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387178/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"On solving first-kind integral equations using wavelets on a bounded interval","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4988728","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On solving first-kind integral equations using wavelets on a bounded interval","sourcePdf":"00387178.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044578S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"178","articleId":"387178","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":387193,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The task was to learn the invariant characteristics of the relationship between sensory information and the FES-control signal by using off-line supervised training. Sensory signals were recorded using pressure sensors installed in the insoles of a subject's shoes and goniometers attached across the joints of the affected leg. The FES-control consisted of pulses corresponding to time intervals when the subject pressed on the manual push-button to deliver the stimulation during FES-assisted ambulation. The machine learning techniques used were the adaptive logic network (ALN) and the inductive learning algorithm (IL). Results to date suggest that, given the same training data, the IL learned faster than the ALN while both performed the test rapidly. The generalization was estimated by measuring the test errors and it was better with an ALN, especially if past points were used to reflect the time dimension. Both techniques were able to predict future stimulation events. An advantage of the ALN over the IL was that ALN's can be retrained with new data without losing previously collected knowledge. The advantages of the IL over the ALN were that the IL produces small, explicit, comprehensible trees and that the relative importance of each sensory contribution can be quantified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.387193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/8775/00387193.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.387193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8775","startPage":"541","endPage":"551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine learning in control of functional electrical stimulation systems for locomotion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Machine learning in control of functional electrical stimulation systems for locomotion","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387193/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4969357","pubMedId":"7790010","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine learning in control of functional electrical stimulation systems for locomotion","sourcePdf":"00387193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039426S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"8775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"97","articleId":"387193","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":387200,"authors":[{"name":"K.

As a result, a practically sparse solution is obtained; computer-simulated solutions for L/sub p/-norm (p=2, 1, 0.5, 0.2) have a small number of significant moments around the real source-dipoles. In particular, the solution for L/sub 1/-norm is equivalent to the minimum-L/sub 1/-norm solution of the original inverse problem.

Many companies are engaged in assessing ways in which their productivity, product quality, and operations can be improved. A relatively new area of such improvements is business process management (BPM). BPM can be any structured approach used to analyze and continually improve fundamental activities, such as manufacturing, marketing, communications, and other major elements of a company's operation. This paper describes a generic step-by-step method for BPM which encompasses methods employed in industry from incremental improvements to reengineering. To better understand BPM, the authors have conducted a survey of major US companies on their approaches to process quality assessment. This report summarizes the findings of the survey and work with a number of leading companies, and may be useful to quality managers and others involved in total quality management, continuous improvement, or reengineering efforts. Due to the interest in BPM, a number of methods and tools, including software, have been used or developed to aid in its implementation. The authors relate some of these methods and tools to the individual steps of the generic BPM method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/17.387274","startPage":"119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","pdfPath":"/iel1/17/8778/00387274.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/17.387274","endPage":"128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Business process management: survey and methodology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387274/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Business process management: survey and methodology","volume":"42","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4953287","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Business process management: survey and methodology","sourcePdf":"00387274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052199S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"17","citationCount":"123","articleId":"387274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":387298,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

The parameter estimates produced by such algorithms are subject to both random and systematic errors when the record of input samples consists of a fundamental sine wave corrupted by harmonic distortion or noise. The errors occur because, in general, such sine-fits will incorporate a portion of the harmonic distortion or noise into their estimate of the fundamental. Bounds are developed for these errors for least-squares four-parameter (amplitude, frequency, phase, and offset) sine-fit algorithms. The errors are functions of the number of periods in the record, the number of samples in the record, the harmonic order, and fundamental and harmonic amplitudes and phases.

This paper presents an optimization model that identifies the types of component improvements and the level of effort spent on those improvements to maximize one or more performance measures (e.g., system reliability or availability) subject to constraints (e.g., cost) in the presence of uncertainty about the component failure rates. For each component failure mode, some possible improvements are identified along with their cost and the resulting improvement in failure rates for that failure mode. The objective function is defined as a stochastic function of the performance measure of interest-in this case, 5/sup th/ percentile of the mean time-between-failure distribution. The problem formulation is combinatorial and stochastic. Genetic algorithms are used as the solution method. Our approach is demonstrated on a case study of a personal computer system. Results and comparison with enumeration of the configuration space show that genetic algorithms perform very favorably in the face of noise in the output: they are able to find the optimum over a complicated, high dimensional, nonlinear space in a tiny fraction of the time required for enumeration. The integration of genetic algorithm optimization capabilities with reliability analysis can provide a robust, powerful design-for-reliability tool.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/24.387368","startPage":"172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel1/24/8781/00387368.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/24.387368","endPage":"178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms in optimization of system reliability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387368/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms in optimization of system reliability","volume":"44","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4988735","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms in optimization of system reliability","sourcePdf":"00387368.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024713S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"61","articleId":"387368","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":387380,"authors":[{"name":"N.P.

To aid in design decision making, a theoretical framework is advanced; the axiomatic approach to design. Axiomatic design consists of: (1) domains in the design world; (2) mapping between these domains; (3) characterization of a design by a vector in each domain; (4) decomposition of the characteristic vectors into hierarchies through a process of zigzagging between the domains; and (5) the design axioms, viz, independence and information axioms. Statistical process control (SPC) and other methodologies to improve quality are valid only when they are consistent with the independence and information axioms. This paper presents several criteria that govern the design and manufacture of quality products. To be able to control the quality of products, a design must satisfy the independence axiom. Based on this axiom and some theorems, several design criteria are derived and discussed. These criteria provide the bounds for the validity of some of the SPC techniques being used. When there is more than one acceptable design of a product or process, the information axiom must be used to select the best design(s).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/24.387380","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel1/24/8781/00387380.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/24.387380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8781","startPage":"256","endPage":"264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing-in of quality through axiomatic design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Designing-in of quality through axiomatic design","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387380/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4988747","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing-in of quality through axiomatic design","sourcePdf":"00387380.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028619S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"14","articleId":"387380","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":387406,"authors":[{"name":"S.G.

The analysis includes both the adaptive prediction error filters and the adaptive transversal filters with two-sided taps. If the product of the instantaneous frequency offset /spl Omega//sub l/, between the jamming signal and the carrier of the spread-spectrum signal, and the sampling period /spl Delta/ is 360/spl deg/ (/spl Omega//sub l//spl middot//spl Delta/=360/spl deg/), the filter gain is reduced to zero. The filter gain G highly depends on the filter adaptation rate /spl mu/. Depending on /spl mu/, G can vary from zero to more than 20 dB for a jammer/signal power ratio (J/S) of 20 dB. If /spl Omega//sub l//spl middot//spl Delta/ is small enough (/spl les/10/spl deg/), the performance of the transversal filter is better than that of the prediction error filter, in the case when /spl mu/ is small. For larger values of /spl mu/ or /spl Omega//sub l//spl middot//spl Delta/, these performances are approximately the same.

The characteristics and implementation aspects of this Bayesian DFE are analyzed, and its performance is compared with those of the conventional symbol or fractional spaced DFE and the maximum likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE). In terms of computational complexity, the adaptive Bayesian DFE is slightly more complex than the conventional DFE but is much simpler than the adaptive MLSE. In terms of error rate in symbol detection, the adaptive Bayesian DFE outperforms the conventional DFE dramatically. Moreover, for severely fading multipath channels, the adaptive MLSE exhibits significant degradation from the theoretical optimal performance and becomes inferior to the adaptive Bayesian DFE.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/8782/00387409.pdf","startPage":"1937","endPage":"1946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.387409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.387409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8782","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Bayesian decision feedback equalizer for dispersive mobile radio channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Decision feedback equalizers","Dispersion","Maximum likelihood estimation","Fading","Adaptive equalizers","Land mobile radio","Robustness","Performance analysis","Maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","fading","multipath channels","adaptive equalisers","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","Bayes methods","decision feedback equalisers","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive Bayesian decision feedback equalizer","dispersive mobile radio channels","adaptive equalization","fading channels","performance","computational complexity","error rate","symbol detection","severely fading multipath channels","adaptive MLSE","degradation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Bayesian decision feedback equalizer for dispersive mobile radio channels","volume":"43","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4969527","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Bayesian decision feedback equalizer for dispersive mobile radio channels","sourcePdf":"00387409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034727S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"68","articleId":"387409","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":387411,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A set of punctured convolutional codes derived from the same original low rate code are said to be complementary if they are equivalent (in terms of their distance properties) and if when combined yield at least the original low rate code. Based on these CPC codes the author proposes and analyzes a variation of the type II hybrid ARQ scheme which is called a type III hybrid ARQ scheme. With the type III hybrid ARQ scheme, the starting code rate can be chosen to match the channel noise requirements, and as with the type II scheme, packets that are detected in error are not discarded, but are combined with complementary transmissions provided by the transmitter to help recover the transmitted message. The main advantage is that any complementary sequence sent for a packet that is detected with errors is self decodable. That is the decoder does not have to rely on previously received sequences for the same data packet for decoding, as is generally the case with incremental redundancy ARQ schemes. This feature is desirable especially in situations where a transmitted packet can be lost or severely damaged as a result of interference. CPC codes can find applications in diversity transmission systems. A novel complementary diversity scheme which makes use of CPC codes is briefly discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.387438","startPage":"2005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/8783/00387438.pdf","endPage":"2009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.387438","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387438/","displayDocTitle":"Complementary punctured convolutional (CPC) codes and their applications","volume":"43","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4994731","publicationDate":"June 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complementary punctured convolutional (CPC) codes and their applications","sourcePdf":"00387438.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048093S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"88","articleId":"387438","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":387442,"authors":[{"name":"K.B.

Starting from this point of view, the quadratic receiver for orthogonal signals over the Gaussian channel with unknown phase/fading has been shown to be equivalent to a detector-estimator receiver. The estimator makes an optimum estimate of the unknown complex channel gain based on the channel measurement provided by the unmodulated component of the received signal. This channel estimate then forms a (partially) coherent reference for the detector in detecting the data carried by the antipodal signaling component of the received signal. This paper exploits this detector-estimator structure of the quadratic receiver, and generalizes it to a receiver in which the estimator makes an estimate of the channel gain in each signaling interval based on the totality of signals received over all the signaling intervals or a subset of these intervals. The generalized quadratic receiver is just as simple to implement as the conventional quadratic receiver, and theoretical and simulation results show that it can achieve substantial performance gains over the conventional receiver. A theory is presented to show that the generalized quadratic receiver is an implementable approximation to the optimum symbol-by-symbol receiver for uncoded orthogonal signals over the Gaussian channel with unknown phase/fading. The theory shows that the structure provides a unified and systematic approach to the design of coherent symbol-by-symbol receivers, and shows that the conventional carrier-loop-type receivers are ad hoc.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gaussian channels","Phase detection","Detectors","Phase estimation","Fading","Gain measurement","Paints","Communications Society","Research and development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection","fading","Gaussian channels","radio receivers","Rayleigh channels","frequency shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized quadratic receivers","pilot tone","Gaussian channel","orthogonal signal structure","antipodal signal set","unmodulated signal component","channel measurement","unknown phase/fading","detector-estimator receiver","complex channel gain","received signal","channel estimate","partially coherent reference","antipodal signaling component","signaling intervals","simulation results","performance gains","optimum symbol-by-symbol receiver","uncoded orthogonal signals","receivers design","carrier-loop-type receivers","FSK"]}],"doi":"10.1109/26.387445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/8783/00387445.pdf","startPage":"2050","endPage":"2059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.387445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized quadratic receivers for orthogonal signals over the Gaussian channel with unknown phase/fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generalized quadratic receivers for orthogonal signals over the Gaussian channel with unknown phase/fading","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387445/","volume":"43","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4994738","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized quadratic receivers for orthogonal signals over the Gaussian channel with unknown phase/fading","sourcePdf":"00387445.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074786S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","articleId":"387445","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":387448,"authors":[{"name":"Qun Shi","affiliation":["Communication Systems Technology Laboratory, Panasonic Technologies, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Qun Shi","id":"37346688600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"387448","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Optical noise","Signal to noise ratio","Gaussian noise","Optical fibers","Bit error rate","Performance analysis","Fiber lasers","Laser modes","Laser noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre networks","optical fibre communication","optical modulation","laser noise","subcarrier multiplexing","Poisson distribution","error statistics","coding errors","quadrature amplitude modulation","amplitude modulation","Gaussian noise","error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["M-ary QAM transmission","optical fiber","hybrid subcarrier-multiplexed transmission","asymptotic clipping noise distribution","error correction codes","AM/QAM transmission","optimum receiver design","BER","hybrid systems","laser clipping","SCM signal","Poisson impulse train","optical modulation indices","AM signals","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","impulsive index","clipping index","power ratio","Gaussian noise","experimental data","digital signals"]}],"abstract":"Performance analysis for a hybrid subcarrier-multiplexed (SCM) AM/QAM transmission over an optical fiber is presented. It is shown that the bit-error-rate (BER) of M-ary QAM in such hybrid systems can be significantly affected due to occasional laser \"clipping\" of the SCM signal. Here we analytically determine the asymptotic distribution of the clipping noise by modeling it as a Poisson impulse train. The BER of M-ary QAM is then evaluated in terms of optical modulation indices of M-ary QAM and AM signals which in turn specify signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), impulsive index (clipping index) of the clipping noise, and power ratio of the Gaussian noise to the clipping noise. Numerical examples are given and compared with experimental data with reasonably good agreement for small SNR's. The results have application for estimating the BER's of digital signals for SCM analog/digital transmission over an optical fiber and for employing appropriate error correction codes and/or optimum receiver design for such environments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.387448","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/8783/00387448.pdf","startPage":"2077","endPage":"2084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.387448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic clipping noise distribution and its impact on M-ary QAM transmission over optical fiber","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387448","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387448/","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic clipping noise distribution and its impact on M-ary QAM transmission over optical fiber","volume":"43","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4994741","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic clipping noise distribution and its impact on M-ary QAM transmission over optical fiber","sourcePdf":"00387448.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046528S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"24","articleId":"387448","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":387453,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Laxpati","affiliation":["LMS Engmeenng, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Laxpati","id":"38222484900"},{"name":"J.W.

The communication signal is characterized by a DS-spread MFSK signal bandwidth that may exceed the FH slot spacing, and the signal consists of multiple M-ary symbols per DS code period. An equation for the bit error rate (BER) is developed for the signal in the presence of multitone jamming. The equation is flexible enough to allow examination of optimization of jamming strategy. It is shown that the jamming strategy may be optimized by varying the number of tones, their placement, or both. It is shown that in the presence of optimized jamming, overlapping systems are more resistant to jamming than nonoverlapping systems with equal parameters (except for the number of FH slots). It is also demonstrated that, in some cases, the addition of DS spreading to an FH system, without increasing the total system bandwidth, can significantly improve the system's resistance to partial band multitone jamming.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.387453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/8783/00387453.pdf","startPage":"2118","endPage":"2126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.387453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of a hybrid SFH/DS MFSK link in the presence of worst case multitone jamming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387453/","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of a hybrid SFH/DS MFSK link in the presence of worst case multitone jamming","volume":"43","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4994746","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of a hybrid SFH/DS MFSK link in the presence of worst case multitone jamming","sourcePdf":"00387453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031644S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","articleId":"387453","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":387454,"authors":[{"name":"Songchar Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Technology, National Yurulin Institute of Technology, Tou-Liu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Songchar Jiang","id":"37350304600"},{"name":"M.-T.T.

This scheme is based on a sensing period and a handshake procedure which can avoid collision and eliminates unwanted transmissions. Several system models under different assumptions, such as completely orthogonal codes and very large processing gain (we call it perfect channel) or with quasiorthogonal codes (nonperfect channel), are investigated. We assume the channel error probability due to other users' interference to be a function of the number of transmissions in a given slot as well as other system parameters. Under a slotted structure with uniform traffic assumption, the system is modeled as a discrete-time two-dimensional Markov chain. The analysis, based on various channel conditions, demonstrates that the average throughput and delay are significantly improved over other spreading code protocols, especially when the channel is likely to accommodate more channel errors, and when the handshaking time is reasonably short compared to the average packet length.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of a receiver-based handshake protocol for CDMA networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.387454","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/8783/00387454.pdf","startPage":"2127","endPage":"2138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.387454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8783","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387454","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387454/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of a receiver-based handshake protocol for CDMA networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4994747","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of a receiver-based handshake protocol for CDMA networks","sourcePdf":"00387454.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039368S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","articleId":"387454","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":387455,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

ST-CDMA can be considered the time-frequency dual of SS-CDMA. In ST-CDMA pseudorandom (PN) sequences are assigned to each user, and the Fourier transform of the transmitted pulse for a given user is determined by modulating the phase of the desired transmitted spectrum by the user's PN-sequence. The transmitted data for a particular user can be recovered by sampling the output of a filter matched to the user's pulse. Implementations are described in which surface acoustic wave devices are used to perform the matched filtering or Fourier transformation. Averaged signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SIR) and spectral efficiency are computed for both asynchronous ST and direct-sequence SS-CDMA systems, assuming an arbitrary channel transfer function H(f), which is the same between all pairs of users. The results are the same for SS and ST provided that the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the chip shape in the SS system is the same as the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the ST pulse shape. The main advantage of the ST technique Is the flexibility with which the transmitted spectrum can be selected.

The techniques, which do not require accurate symbol timing nor a data preamble sequence, employ fast Fourier transforms (FFT's) on the Costas loop phase detector output to detect the Doppler frequency offset. Performance of the full-, half-, and staggered-symbol integration techniques as well as the low-pass filter technique are compared in terms of the error signal output SNR's. Then, the probability of detecting the frequency offset is computed for the special case when the frequency of the tone to be detected coincides with one of the FFT-bin center frequencies. It is shown that the performance of the integration techniques depends strongly on the symbol timing offset. On the other hand, the detection probability for the one-pole arm filter technique depends directly on the filter bandwidth. The staggered integration technique is shown to have comparable performance to the low-pass filter technique for low-to-medium symbol SNR's but the latter is superior at high symbol SNR's.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.387457","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/8783/00387457.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.387457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8783","startPage":"2157","endPage":"2167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of four FFT-based frequency acquisition techniques for Costas loop BPSK signal demodulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of four FFT-based frequency acquisition techniques for Costas loop BPSK signal demodulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387457/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4994750","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of four FFT-based frequency acquisition techniques for Costas loop BPSK signal demodulation","sourcePdf":"00387457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036177S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","articleId":"387457","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":387491,"authors":[{"name":"Qin-Sheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Care Center, New York, NY, USA","Experimental Medical Imaging Laboratory, NUGE, AZVUB, Brussels, Belgium"],"lastName":"Qin-Sheng Chen","id":"37068988100"},{"name":"M.

The approach consists of two steps: the calculation of a Fourier-Mellin invariant (FMI) descriptor for each image to be matched, and the matching of the FMI descriptors. The FMI descriptor is translation invariant, and represents rotation and scaling as translations in parameter space. The matching of the FMI descriptors is achieved using symmetric phase-only matched filtering (SPOMF). The performance of the FMI-SPOMF algorithm is the same or similar to that of phase-only matched filtering when dealing with image translations. The significant advantage of the new technique is its capability to match rotated and scaled images accurately and efficiently. The innovation is the application of SPOMF to the FMI descriptors, which guarantees high discriminating power and excellent robustness in the presence of noise. This paper describes the principle of the new method and its discrete implementation for either image detection problems or image registration problems. Practical results are presented for various applications in medical imaging, remote sensing, fingerprint recognition and multiobject identification.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.387491","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/8785/00387491.pdf","startPage":"1156","endPage":"1168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.387491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symmetric phase-only matched filtering of Fourier-Mellin transforms for image registration and recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Symmetric phase-only matched filtering of Fourier-Mellin transforms for image registration and recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4871840","volume":"16","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symmetric phase-only matched filtering of Fourier-Mellin transforms for image registration and recognition","sourcePdf":"00387491.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077333S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"8785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"392","articleId":"387491","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":387503,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Arcs with slightly different local curvature or position may lead to exactly the same digital pattern. In this paper the authors give a characterization of all centers and radii of circular arcs yielding the same digitization pattern. The radius of the arcs varies over the set. However, only one curvature or radius estimate can be assigned to the digital pattern. The authors derive an optimal estimator and give expressions for the bound on the precision of estimation. This bound due to digitization is the deterministic equivalent of the Cramer/Rao bound known from parameter estimation theory. Consider the estimation of the local curvature and local radius of a smooth object. Typically such parameters are estimated by moving a window along the digital boundary. Methods in literature show a poor precision in estimating curvature values, relative errors of over 40% are often found. From the definition of curvature it follows that locally the curve can be considered a circular arc and hence the method presented in this paper can be applied to the pattern in the window giving estimates with optimal precision and a measure for the remaining error. On the practical side the authors present examples of the residual error due to the discrete grid. The estimation of the radius or curvature of a circular arc at random position with an estimation window containing 10 points (coded with nine Freemancodes) has a relative deviation exceeding 2%. For a full disk the deviation is below 1% when the radius r exceeds four grid units. The presented method is particularly useful for problems where some prior knowledge on the distribution of radii is known and where there is a noise-free sampling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.387505","startPage":"587","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/8786/00387505.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.387505","endPage":"598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digitized circular arcs: characterization and parameter estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387505/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Digitized circular arcs: characterization and parameter estimation","volume":"17","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4988898","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digitized circular arcs: characterization and parameter estimation","sourcePdf":"00387505.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053714S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"40","articleId":"387505","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":387512,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Post-processing of the collected data is performed in many of these techniques to obtain high-quality images of buried targets. Accurate reconstructions of the target's constitutive parameters can be obtained by casting the imaging problem in terms of an inverse electromagnetic scattering problem. A number of techniques have been put forth recently to invert the electromagnetic data to obtain such images. The authors use a frequency-domain Born iterative method to reconstruct images of shallow targets. The Born iterative technique requires successive solutions to a forward scattering problem followed by an inverse scattering problem at each iteration step. They use a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm to solve the forward scattering problem and constrained optimization for the inverse problem. Two-dimensional simulated data for several canonical objects buried in the ground are obtained using the FDTD technique. The same FDTD code is also used in calculating the Green's function required for solving the constrained optimization problem. Lossy, inhomogeneous ground models are used in several simulations to illustrate the use of this technique for practical situations. The inversion process can be used to reconstruct images for many realistic dielectric contrasts for which a linear Born approximation fails. Moreover, it is also shown that a small number of measurements results in accurate reconstructions with this technique.

The purpose of the approach is to allow the interpretation of the \"network behavior\", as it can be utilized by photointerpreters for the validation of the neural classifier. In addition, this approach gives a criterion for defining the network architecture, so avoiding the classical trial-and-error process. First of all, the architecture of structured multilayer feedforward networks is tailored to a multisensor classification problem. Then, such networks are trained to solve the problem by the error backpropagation algorithm. Finally, they are transformed into equivalent networks to obtain a simplified representation. The resulting equivalent networks may be interpreted as a hierarchical arrangement of \"committees\" that accomplish the classification task by checking on a set of explicit constraints on input data. Experimental results on a multisensor (optical and SAR) data set are described in terms of both classification accuracy and network interpretation.

The analysis of unwrapping is done quite separately from instantaneous frequency estimation so that the reliability of both steps can be assessed independently. Various methods for evaluating 2-D instantaneous frequency are presented and compared in the presence of noise and amplitude variations. A study has also been made on aliasing arising in areas where, with respect to instantaneous frequency, spatial sampling is insufficient. The presence of noise in the data further complicates phase aliasing analysis since there is no way to distinguish between the aliasing due to noise or that due to steep phase slopes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.387574","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/8788/00387574.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.387574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2-D phase unwrapping and instantaneous frequency estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387574/","displayDocTitle":"2-D phase unwrapping and instantaneous frequency estimation","volume":"33","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4988912","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2-D phase unwrapping and instantaneous frequency estimation","sourcePdf":"00387574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059743S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"99","articleId":"387574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":387575,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

Two approaches are considered, interactive cloud screening and automated cloud screening. In interactive cloud screening a neural network is trained on a set of data points which are interactively selected from the image to be screened. Because the data variability is limited within a single image, a very simple neural network topology is sufficient to generate an effective cloud screen. Consequently, network training is very quick and only a few training samples are required. In automated cloud screening, where a general network is designed to handle all images, the data variability can be significant and the resulting neural network topology is more complex. The latitudinal, seasonal and spatial dependence of cloud screening large AVHRR data sets is studied using an extensive data set spanning 7 years. A neural network and associated feature set are designed to cloud screen this data set. The sensitivity of the thermal infrared bands to high atmospheric water vapor concentration was found to limit the accuracy of cloud screening methods which rely solely on data from these channels. These limitations are removed when the visible channel data is used in combination with the thermal infrared data. A post processing algorithm is developed to improve the cloud screening results of the network in the presence of high atmospheric water vapor concentration. Post processing also is effective in identifying pixels contaminated by subpixel clouds and/or amplifier hysteresis effects at cloud-ocean boundaries. The neural network, when combined with the post processing algorithm, produces accurate cloud screens for the large, regionally distributed AVHRR data set.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.387575","startPage":"590","endPage":"604","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/8788/00387575.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.387575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of neural networks to AVHRR cloud segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Clouds","Ocean temperature","Network topology","Satellite broadcasting","Image segmentation","Image analysis","Sea surface","Water pollution","Hysteresis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","remote sensing","oceanographic techniques","clouds","infrared imaging","image segmentation","geophysical signal processing","image processing","feedforward neural nets","geophysics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["marine atmosphere","meteorology","remote sensing","optical imaging","visible infrared IR method","geophysical measurement technique","image processing","neural network","neural net","AVHRR cloud segmentation","cloud screening","interactive cloud screening","automated method","training","post processing algorithm","ocean SST","sea surface temperature","land surface terrain mapping","patter recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387575/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Application of neural networks to AVHRR cloud segmentation","volume":"33","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4988913","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of neural networks to AVHRR cloud segmentation","sourcePdf":"00387575.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041045S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"47","articleId":"387575","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":387577,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

In order to evaluate the authors ability to use ASTER data for geological mapping, they created a simulated 14-band ASTER data set for Cuprite, Nevada. The study site has sparse vegetation and exposes a wide range of unaltered and hydrothermally altered volcanic rocks. The wide range of wavelengths covered by ASTER allowed them to distinguish iron oxide minerals, clay-bearing minerals, sulfate minerals, ammonia minerals, siliceous rocks, and carbonates. Based on interpretation of the ASTER data, and in conjunction with laboratory and field spectral measurements, they produced an alteration map showing the distribution of argillized rocks, opalized rocks with alunite, silicified rocks, and areas dominated by kaolinite and buddingtonite. The map was as accurate as published maps made by traditional field methods.

In previous work, supervised methods have been shown to yield higher accuracy than unsupervised techniques, but suffer from the need for human interaction to determine classes and training regions. In contrast, unsupervised methods determine classes automatically, but generally show limited ability to accurately divide terrain into natural classes. In this paper, a new classification technique is applied to determine sea ice types in polarimetric and multifrequency SAR images, utilizing an unsupervised neural network to provide automatic classification, and employing an iterative algorithm to improve the performance. The learning vector quantization (LVQ) is first applied to the unsupervised classification of SAR images, and the results are compared with those of a conventional technique, the migrating means method. Results show that LVQ outperforms the migrating means method, but performance is still poor. An iterative algorithm is then applied where the SAR image is reclassified using the maximum likelihood (ML) classifier. It is shown that this algorithm converges, and significantly improves classification accuracy. The new algorithm successfully identifies first-year and multiyear sea ice regions in the images at three frequencies. The results show that L- and P-band images have similar characteristics, while the C-band image is substantially different. Classification based on single features is also carried out using LVQ and the iterative ML method. It is found that the fully polarimetric classification provides a higher accuracy than those based on a single feature. The significance of multilook classification is demonstrated by comparing the results obtained using four-look and single-look classifications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387589/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4988927","volume":"33","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of neural networks for sea ice classification in polarimetric SAR images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of neural networks for sea ice classification in polarimetric SAR images","sourcePdf":"00387589.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046496S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"40","articleId":"387589","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":387598,"authors":[{"name":"N.R.

The model provides expressions for the real and imaginary parts of the relative dielectric constant of a soil medium in terms of the soil's textural composition (sand, silt, and clay fractions), the bulk density and volumetric moisture content of the soil, and the dielectric constant of water at the specified microwave frequency and physical temperature. This communication provides similar expressions for the 0.3-1.3-GHz range. Upon comparing experimental results measured in this study with predictions based on the semiempirical model, it was found that the model underpredicts the real part of the dielectric constant for high-moisture cases and underestimates the imaginary part for all soils and moisture conditions. A small linear adjustment has been introduced to correct the expression for the real part and a new equation was generated for the effective conductivity to correct the expression for the imaginary part. In addition, dielectric measurements were made to evaluate the dependence of the dielectric constant on clay type. The results show significant variations for the real part and large variations for the imaginary part among soils with the same clay fractions but with clays of different specific surface areas.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dielectric properties of soils in the 0.3-1.3-GHz range","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.387598","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/8788/00387598.pdf","startPage":"803","endPage":"807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.387598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8788","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387598/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Dielectric properties of soils in the 0.3-1.3-GHz range","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4988935","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dielectric properties of soils in the 0.3-1.3-GHz range","sourcePdf":"00387598.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024092S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"405","articleId":"387598","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":387611,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

Experimental measurements of the static torque production characteristics of a 4 kW, four-phase switched reluctance motor form the basis of simulation studies of this novel approach. The simulation results demonstrate the capability of fuzzy adaptive systems to learn nonlinear current profiles that minimize torque ripple. The use of fuzzy systems in this application has potential advantages where the incorporation of a priori information, expressed linguistically, is concerned.

In order to achieve fault tolerance in dynamical systems many algorithms have been developed during the past two decades. Fault diagnosis and accommodation methods have traditionally been based on linear modeling techniques, which restricts the type of practical failure situations that can be modeled. This article presents a learning methodology for failure detection and accommodation. The main idea behind this approach is to monitor the physical system for any off-nominal behavior in its dynamics using nonlinear modeling techniques. The principal design tool used is a generic function approximator with adjustable parameters, referred to as online approximator. Examples of such structures include traditional approximation models such as polynomials and splines as well as neural networks topologies such as sigmoidal multilayer networks and radial basis function networks. Stable learning methods are developed for monitoring the dynamical system. The nonlinear modeling nature and learning capability of the estimator allow the output of the online approximator to be used not only for detection but also for identification and accommodation of system failures. Simulation studies are used to illustrate the learning methodology and to gain intuition into the effect of modeling uncertainties on the performance of the fault diagnosis scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning methodology for failure detection and accommodation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","doi":"10.1109/37.387613","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/5488303/8789/00387613.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.387613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8789","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387613/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","displayDocTitle":"Learning methodology for failure detection and accommodation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4987519","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning methodology for failure detection and accommodation","sourcePdf":"00387613.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046799S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"8789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"90","articleId":"387613","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":387619,"authors":[{"name":"Jinwoo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Jinwoo Kim","id":"37351556300"},{"name":"Yoonkeon Moon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Yoonkeon Moon","id":"37380822500"},{"name":"B.P.

To provide a wide perspective of different developments, we selected four projects to summarize. These projects were originally presented at Microneuro 1994. The first two projects are optical and optoelectronic implementations. While the majority of neural nets are built in silicon, an active research community works on optical networks. The high connectivity of neural nets makes communication among the processors one of the main difficulties in implementation. With optical beams, a large number of elements can be addressed in parallel, making optics an attractive alternative to silicon. D.C. Burns and coauthors describe a combination of optics and electronics. The authors have built an optical input plane for a neural net so that whole images with tens of thousands of pixels can be entered into a network in parallel. S.R. Skinner, J.E. Steck, and E.C. Behrman present an all optical network, where optically nonlinear materials perform not only the communication but also the calculations. Learning remains a tricky problem for a hardware implementation, in particular for analog circuits. Popular learning algorithms, such as backpropagation, require a high computational resolution. How to implement learning techniques in low-resolution electronics is the subject of intense research. G. Cairns and L. Tarassenko address this issue by comparing the required precision for different learning schemes. The final project is a digital circuit implementing a self-organizing feature map, an unsupervised learning technique. In this example, computational resolution is also a major problem. Before building a chip, researchers experimented extensively to determine the minimum resolution required for good results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/40.387685","startPage":"48","endPage":"59","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","pdfPath":"/iel1/40/8790/00387685.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/40.387685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks-extraordinary variation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Nonlinear optics","Optical fiber networks","Optical devices","Optical computing","Silicon","Electronic circuits","Optical beams","Pixel","All-optical networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","implementations","electronic circuits","optical implementations","optoelectronic implementations","connectivity","optical input plane","all optical network","optically nonlinear materials","backpropagation","low-resolution electronics","self-organizing feature map","unsupervised learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387685/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks-extraordinary variation","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4974966","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks-extraordinary variation","sourcePdf":"00387685.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057537S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","citationCount":"1","articleId":"387685","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":387690,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Windowing reduces noise in orbiting rod transmission studies. Lines-of-response (LOR) which intersect the rods generate primarily true coincidence events. LOR which pass far from the rods generate random and scatter events. Since the angular position of the orbiting rods is known in real-time, LOR which produce mostly noise are gated off. When optimally determined, the rod window width maximizes the noise equivalent counts (NEC) collected in the transmission study.

The model is divided into an instrumental part represented by the point spread function (in the far field) of the ultrasonic apparatus and a moving tissue component described by a collection of scatterers. By computing the convolution of these terms and then the envelope, one obtains a simulated ultrasonic speckle pattern sequence which shows speckle motions closely linked to the tissue dynamics when small motion amplitudes are involved. Here, a theoretical study of the correlation between various linear transformations of the tissue and the corresponding ultrasonic speckle motions is performed, based on a 2D extension of the envelope cross-correlation analysis of a narrow-band Gaussian noise. In the linear scan case, obviously, tissue translation generates an identical speckle translation. However, tissue/speckle motion correlation decreases with increasing rotation and/or biaxial deformation, lateral deformation (perpendicular to the beam propagation axis) being much less sensitive. With respect to the transducer frequency, the rotation and the axial deformation of the tissue show a better relationship with their respective speckle motion at lower frequencies while lateral deformation correlation is independent of the pulse frequency. With respect to beam (pulse) size parameters, tissue/speckle correlation decreases with rotation when a wide ultrasonic beam is used while the axial deformation correlation decreases with the axial duration of the pulse. This study sets the ground for the development of an ultrasonic strain gauge particularly useful for the assessment of biomechanical soft tissue and fluid flow properties based on speckle tracking.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/8791/00387711.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"300","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/42.387711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.387711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8791","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasonic texture motion analysis: theory and simulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion analysis","Analytical models","Speckle","Frequency","Instruments","Scattering","Convolution","Computational modeling","Performance analysis","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image texture","medical image processing","motion estimation","speckle","biomedical ultrasonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic texture motion analysis","point spread function","moving tissue component","terms convolution","tissue dynamics","tissue linear transformations","narrow-band Gaussian noise","envelope cross-correlation analysis","tissue translation","biaxial deformation","lateral deformation","ultrasonic strain gauge","biomechanical soft tissue properties","fluid flow properties","speckle tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387711/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonic texture motion analysis: theory and simulation","volume":"14","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4982024","pubMedId":"18215833","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasonic texture motion analysis: theory and simulation","sourcePdf":"00387711.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088071S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"8791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"140","articleId":"387711","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":387712,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Two typically ill-posed problems have been faced: 1) the detection of the left ventricle contours in each view, and 2) the integration of the detected contour points (which form a sparse and partially inconsistent data set) into a single surface representation. The authors' solution to these problems is based on a careful integration of standard computer vision algorithms with neural networks. Boundary detection comprises three steps: edge detection, edge grouping, and edge classification. The first and second steps (which are typical early-vision tasks not involving specific domain-knowledge) have been performed through fast, well-established algorithms of computer vision. The higher level task of left ventricle-edge discrimination, which involves the exploitation of specific knowledge about the left ventricle silhouette, has been performed by feedforward neural networks. Following the most recent results in the field of computer vision, the first step in solving the problem of recovering the ventricle surface has been the adoption of a physically inspired model of it. Basically, the authors have modeled the left ventricle surface as a closed, thin, elastic surface and the data as a set of radial springs acting on it. The recovery process is equivalent to the settling of the surface-plus-springs system into a stable configuration of minimum potential energy. The finite element discretization of this model leads directly to an analog neural-network implementation. The efficiency of such an implementation has been remarkably enhanced through a learning algorithm which embeds specific knowledge about the shape of the left ventricle in the network. Experiments using clinical echographic sequences are described. Four apical views (each with a different rotation of the probe) have been acquired during a heartbeat from a set of seven normal subjects. These images have been utilized to set the various processing modules and test their capabilities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387712/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4982025","pubMedId":"18215834","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"14","issue":"2","displayDocTitle":"Recovery of the 3-D shape of the left ventricle from echocardiographic images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recovery of the 3-D shape of the left ventricle from echocardiographic images","sourcePdf":"00387712.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051836S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"8791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"76","articleId":"387712","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":387716,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Cao","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, University of Chicago Hospitals, Chicago, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Yue Cao","id":"37087725550"},{"name":"D.N.

The resulting images were characterized by spatially variable spatial resolution and were particularly well-resolved in regions where the training images had structural detail.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.387716","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/8791/00387716.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.387716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","displayDocTitle":"Using an image database to constrain the acquisition and reconstruction of MR images of the human head","volume":"14","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4982029","pubMedId":"18215838","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387716/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using an image database to constrain the acquisition and reconstruction of MR images of the human head","sourcePdf":"00387716.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03786S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"8791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"21","articleId":"387716","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-14"},{"_id":387720,"authors":[{"name":"Heesub Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Heesub Lee","id":"37087263449"},{"name":"Yongmin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Yongmin Kim","id":"37087147924"},{"name":"E.A.

To obtain better quality in the compressed images, human visual perception characteristics are applied to the classification and bit allocation. This CVQ has been subjectively evaluated for a sequence of X-ray CT images and compared to a DCT coding method. Nine X-ray CT head images from three patients are compressed at 10:1 and 15:1 compression ratios and are evaluated by 13 radiologists. The evaluation data are analyzed statistically with analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple comparison. Even though there are large variations in judging image quality among readers, the proposed algorithm has shown significantly better quality than the DCT at a statistical, significance level of 0.05. Only an interframe CVQ can reproduce the quality of the originals at 10:1 compression at the same significance level. While the CVQ can reproduce compressed images that are not statistically different from the originals in quality, the effect on diagnostic accuracy remains to be investigated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.387720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8791","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/8791/00387720.pdf","endPage":"406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A predictive classified vector quantizer and its subjective quality evaluation for X-ray CT images","doi":"10.1109/42.387720","startPage":"397","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","displayDocTitle":"A predictive classified vector quantizer and its subjective quality evaluation for X-ray CT images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387720/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4982033","pubMedId":"18215842","publicationDate":"June 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A predictive classified vector quantizer and its subjective quality evaluation for X-ray CT images","sourcePdf":"00387720.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067806S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"8791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"11","articleId":"387720","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":387722,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Hui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"lastName":"Yan Hui","id":"37087263618"},{"name":"M.R.

These devices exhibit negative differential resistance (NDR) and/or negative transconductance in their I-V characteristics and have active dimensions of a few nanometers. Since the conventional drift-diffusion approximation is not valid for simulation of device behavior at this microscopic scale, quantum simulation models based on the Schrodinger equation are required to accurately predict the behavior of the device. However, these models are too slow for circuit simulation. This paper describes a modeling scheme that maintains the accuracy of the quantum simulation while achieving satisfactory speed for circuit simulation, and is applicable to a wide range of two and three terminal resonant tunneling devices and may also be extended to future scaled-down MOS and bipolar devices. A self-consistent solution of the Poisson and the Schrodinger equations for various bias points is used to build up tables of conductances, capacitances and other parameters. Table-lookup methods are then used during circuit simulation. Convergence techniques have been developed to overcome the problems caused by the NDR characteristics and the lookup-table model in simulation. While implementation details are presented for a resonant tunneling transistor (RTT), models for several other quantum electronic devices have also been implemented in NDR-SPICE.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","volume":"14","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4975294","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Device and circuit simulation of quantum electronic devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Device and circuit simulation of quantum electronic devices","sourcePdf":"00387727.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045758S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"31","articleId":"387727","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":387730,"authors":[{"name":"F.

However, the underlying model of those languages does not directly support the specification of embedded systems, making the task of specifying such systems tedious and error-prone. We introduce a new conceptual model, called Program-State Machines (PSM), that caters to embedded systems. We describe SpecCharts, a VHDL extension that supports capture of the PSM model. The extensions we describe can also be applied to other languages. SpecCharts can be easily incorporated into a VHDL design environment using automatic translation to VHDL.

When such networks employ multiple wavelengths, however, some of the most substantial new research challenges are those posed by the amplifier chains themselves. Such networks suffer from accumulating interchannel power spread, from sensitivity to interamplifier loss variations, and from transient cross saturation, as the network undergoes reconfiguration. All of these difficulties effectively vanish in a chain of saturated lightwave amplifiers whose per-channel gains are decoupled by, e.g., inhomogeneous broadening. Unlike conventional, homogeneously broadened systems, saturated fiber-amplifier chains with decoupled gain dynamics provide automatic channel-by-channel power regulation, tolerance to interamplifier loss variations, and immunity to transient cross saturation. Thus, if amplifiers with such decoupled gain dynamics can be implemented in a practical way, they promise to solve-in a single stroke-several of the most substantial technological challenges facing transparent multiwavelength lightwave networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4982237","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Inhomogeneously broadened fiber-amplifier cascades for transparent multiwavelength lightwave networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inhomogeneously broadened fiber-amplifier cascades for transparent multiwavelength lightwave networks","sourcePdf":"00387795.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036877S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"21","articleId":"387795","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":387796,"authors":[{"name":"Kao-Chun Lee","affiliation":["Communication Sciences Institute Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Kao-Chun Lee","id":"37087998070"},{"name":"V.O.K.

One constraint of EDFA's is that they have a much narrower bandwidth (/spl ap/25 nm) compared to the low-loss region (/spl ap/200 mn) of optical fiber. Instead of using only wavelengths within the bandwidth of EDFA's (i.e. the inband channels) for communication, we propose to include wavelengths outside the EDFA bandwidth (i.e. the outband channels) as well in order to increase the number of wavelengths and/or channel spacings that can be accommodated. Using outband wavelengths for sending messages presents a new constraint, namely that only if the power loss for transmitting a message is small enough can this message be transmitted on the outband wavelength. We develop wavelength-routing algorithms on arbitrary network topologies and wavelength assignments in hierarchical networks for sending messages subject to this constraint. We also analyze the SNR for inband/outband WDM signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.387796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.387796","startPage":"791","endPage":"801","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/8795/00387796.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-wavelength all-optical networks with wavelengths outside the erbium-doped fiber amplifier bandwidth","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Multi-wavelength all-optical networks with wavelengths outside the erbium-doped fiber amplifier bandwidth","publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4982238","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387796/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-wavelength all-optical networks with wavelengths outside the erbium-doped fiber amplifier bandwidth","sourcePdf":"00387796.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0323S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"5","articleId":"387796","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":387799,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The accumulation of the small impairment factors that was negligible in the conventional system becomes significant to determine the transmission performances of the amplified system. The fiber nonlinearity is a distinctive limitation factor that dominates the transmission performance of the amplified system, although it was not a limitation factor in the conventional system. This paper describes the recent progress of the undersea lightwave cable systems employing optical amplifier repeaters. The limitation factors and the polarization dependent characteristics of the amplified system are described. The system demonstrations with conventional IM-DD technology are presented using both recirculating loop and straight fiber transmission line. The system maintenance method is also explained briefly. Future technologies adopting the WDM or the optical solitons are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber polarization","Optical solitons","Repeaters","Optical fiber cables","Stimulated emission","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical fiber amplifiers","Optical fiber losses","Optical design","Power cables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fibre lasers","optical links","optical repeaters","optical cables","submarine cables","wavelength division multiplexing","optical solitons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplified undersea systems","optical amplifiers","loss limitation","retiming","reshaping","regenerating","design criteria","undersea lightwave systems","impairment factors","transmission performances","fiber nonlinearity","transmission performance","undersea lightwave cable systems","optical amplifier repeaters","polarization dependent characteristics","IM-DD technology","recirculating loop","straight fiber transmission line","system maintenance method","WDM","optical solitons"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.387799","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/8795/00387799.pdf","startPage":"829","endPage":"840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8795","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.387799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent progress in amplified undersea systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387799","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Recent progress in amplified undersea systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387799/","volume":"13","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4982241","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent progress in amplified undersea systems","sourcePdf":"00387799.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0823S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"15","articleId":"387799","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":387800,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

The nonlinear Schrodinger equation, which simulates signal propagation in optical fibers, is numerically evaluated to clarify the optimum configuration for GVD compensation.

The optimum compensation interval is found to be a function of the bit rate, signal power, and dispersion parameter. For dispersion parameter values ranging from about -0.1 ps/nm/km to -10 ps/nm/km, and an amplifier noise figure of about 6 dB, the optimum compensation configuration can eliminate the GVD from in-line amplifier systems, thus improving transmission distances to those limited by self-phase modulation and higher-order GVD.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.387803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8795","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.387803","endPage":"867","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/8795/00387803.pdf","startPage":"862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission distance of in-line amplifier systems with group-velocity-dispersion compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387803/","displayDocTitle":"Transmission distance of in-line amplifier systems with group-velocity-dispersion compensation","volume":"13","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4982245","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission distance of in-line amplifier systems with group-velocity-dispersion compensation","sourcePdf":"00387803.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028522S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"17","articleId":"387803","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":387804,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Circulating loop techniques, applied to an amplifier chain of modest length, can provide an experimental platform to study a broad range of transmission phenomena for EDFA-based transmission systems. A loop experiment attempts to simulate the transmission performance of a multi-thousand kilometer long system by reusing or recirculating an optical signal through a modest length amplifier chain of tens to hundreds of kilometers. This paper reviews original loop techniques developed to study various parameters of long-haul transmission using erbium-doped fiber-amplifiers repeaters for undersea systems. Transmission experiments were performed at transoceanic distances with 33 and 46 km amplifier spacing, operating at 5 and 10 Gb/s.

The distribution of multiple AM CATV channels over long fiber spans is degraded by the presence of Rayleigh backscatter-induced low-frequency interferometric noise. When the laser source is modulated externally, the low-frequency interferometric noise is mixed and translated around the AM carriers. Furthermore, when isolators are not used with the optical amplifiers, the low end of the broadcast channels could be severely degraded due to doubly amplified Rayleigh backscatter. Employing narrow-linewidth semiconductor or Nd:YAG laser sources at the transmitter will lower the tail of the low-frequency interferometric noise level but will increase the translated noise peak level at each AM carrier. Therefore, the standard CNR measurement techniques, which assumes the noise spectrum is flat, may not reveal the correct video picture quality seen at the customer premises. In this analysis, we compared NCTA RF CNR and baseband video SNR results using CCIR recommended unified weighting filter. We determined that for laser linewidth less than 1 MHz and with long fiber spans, baseband video SNR as opposed to RF CNR measurements should be used to characterize the performance of AM-VSB CATV broadcast distribution systems. Finally, an experimental 78-channel AM-VSB CATV distribution system is constructed employing two EDFA's simulating head-end and hub sites and we compared RF CNR and baseband video SNR measurements using a 700-kHz linewidth externally modulated 1550-nm DFB transmitter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.387811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.387811","startPage":"933","endPage":"946","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/8795/00387811.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rayleigh backscatter effects on 1550-nm CATV distribution systems employing optical amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Rayleigh backscatter effects on 1550-nm CATV distribution systems employing optical amplifiers","publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4982253","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387811/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rayleigh backscatter effects on 1550-nm CATV distribution systems employing optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00387811.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042015S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","articleId":"387811","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":387817,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.

The theory allows an arbitrary shaped electrical filter in the receiver circuit. The moment generating function (MGF) allows for a precise calculation of the error rate by using the inverse Fast Fourier transform (FFT). The exact results are compared with the usual Gaussian approximation (GA), the saddlepoint approximation (SAP) and the modified Chernoff bound (MCB). This comparison shows that the noise is not Gaussian distributed for all values of the optical amplifier gain. In the region from 20-30 dB gain, calculations show that the GA underestimates the receiver sensitivity while the SAP is very close to the results of our exact model. Using the MGF derived in the article we then find the optimal bandwidth of the electrical filter in the receiver circuit and calculate the sensitivity degradation due to inter symbol interference (ISI).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8795","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.387817","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/8795/00387817.pdf","startPage":"977","endPage":"981","doi":"10.1109/50.387817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detailed noise statistics for an optically preamplified direct detection receiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Detailed noise statistics for an optically preamplified direct detection receiver","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4982259","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387817/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detailed noise statistics for an optically preamplified direct detection receiver","sourcePdf":"00387817.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050072S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"27","articleId":"387817","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":387894,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The solution of the problems is based upon the implementation of two optimal reactive power flow (ORPF) programs: the first relevant to determining a workable state (security aspect); and the second relevant to attaining the optimal and secure point (global target). The first ORPF is solved by recursively employing a linear programming algorithm, whilst the second is based on the Han-Powell algorithm. In the paper, emphasis is given to the introduction of the contingency constraints in the ORPF models. The N-1 security constraints are explicitly introduced in the programs in order to obtain an operating point preventive-secure with respect to a selected contingency set. The performances of the procedures are shown by presenting the numerical results obtained from their applications to a small test network and to the large ENEL transmission system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/8797/00387894.pdf","startPage":"602","endPage":"608","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.387894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.387894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8797","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contingency constrained optimal reactive power flow procedures for voltage control in planning and operation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power control","Voltage control","Reactive power","Power system planning","Power system security","Investments","Power generation","Constraint optimization","Linear programming","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system control","power system planning","optimal control","reactive power control","load flow","load regulation","power system security","power system stability","linear programming","power system analysis computing","control system analysis computing","digital simulation","transmission networks","transmission network calculations","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system voltage profile optimization","voltage control","optimal reactive power flow","contingency constraints","scheduling","planning","operating point","global target","computer simulation","computation time","linear programming algorithm","Han-Powell algorithm","N-1 security constraints","performance","transmission system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","displayDocTitle":"Contingency constrained optimal reactive power flow procedures for voltage control in planning and operation","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4983256","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contingency constrained optimal reactive power flow procedures for voltage control in planning and operation","sourcePdf":"00387894.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074514S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"42","articleId":"387894","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":387899,"authors":[{"name":"K.D.

The results of these experiments also indicate the decoupled nature of the state estimation problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.387909","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/8797/00387909.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.387909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8797","startPage":"724","endPage":"730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel and distributed state estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parallel and distributed state estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387909/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4983271","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel and distributed state estimation","sourcePdf":"00387909.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060173S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"155","articleId":"387909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":387910,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A well recognized difficulty is that the solutions to these subproblems may oscillate between maximum and minimum generations with slight changes of the multipliers. Furthermore, the subproblem solutions may become singular, i.e., they are undetermined when the linear coefficients become zero. This may result in large differences between subproblem solutions and the optimal primal schedule. In this paper, a nonlinear approximation method is presented which utilizes nonlinear functions, quadratic in this case, to approximate relevant linear cost functions. The analysis shows that the difficulty associated with solution oscillation is reduced, and singularity is avoided. Extensive testing based on Northeast Utilities data indicates that the method consistently generates better schedules than the standard Lagrangian relaxation method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4983278","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear approximation method in Lagrangian relaxation-based algorithms for hydrothermal scheduling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear approximation method in Lagrangian relaxation-based algorithms for hydrothermal scheduling","sourcePdf":"00387916.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029067S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"107","articleId":"387916","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":387922,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

An efficient economic power dispatch algorithm must use real-time load conditions and the loss penalty-factor for representation of transmission losses in power system. The approach described in this paper assumes that an interface program will calculate the penalty factors for the current power flow state, as calculated by a state estimation program. The proposed method employs an ANN to enhance the speed and capability of algorithms which may use heuristics for online use. The ability of processing feedbacks in a collective parallel analog mode enables a neural network to simulate the dynamics that represent the optimization of an objective function subjected to its constraints for a given optimization model. Different techniques may be used to simulate the neural dynamic system. In this study, the authors propose a new method of simulation called the clamped state variable (CSV) technique. The new approach is very simple and it takes smaller computer time for the algorithm to converge than the complete circuit simulation. The results obtained by the CSV method are very close to that of numerical methods and are reported in this paper.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.387935","startPage":"925","endPage":"931","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/8797/00387935.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.387935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clamped state solution of artificial neural network for real-time economic dispatch","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Circuit simulation","Power system economics","Power generation economics","Propagation losses","Constraint optimization","Computational modeling","Real time systems","Power systems","Load flow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system control","load dispatching","neurocontrollers","power system state estimation","economics","optimal control","control system analysis computing","power system analysis computing","digital simulation","real-time systems","transmission networks","transmission network calculations","feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time economic dispatch","artificial neural network","clamped state variable formulation","algorithm","transmission losses","power system","power flow state estimation","heuristics","computer simulation","CPU time","feedbacks","optimization","objective function","convergence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387935/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","displayDocTitle":"Clamped state solution of artificial neural network for real-time economic dispatch","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4983297","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clamped state solution of artificial neural network for real-time economic dispatch","sourcePdf":"00387935.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069847S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"35","articleId":"387935","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":387937,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

The paper provides background on the operation of the filter, the details of the power circuit, the details of the control design, representative waveforms, and spectral performance for a filter which supports a 384 W AC controller and a 900 W uncontrolled bridge rectifier. Experimental data indicate that the active filter typically consumes 3% or less of the average load power, suggesting that a parallel filter is an efficient compensation approach. The spectral performance shows that the active filter brings the system into compliance with IEC-555 for decision frequencies in excess of 30 kHz. A discussion is presented outlining an alternative single-phase active filter which uses two controllable switches and is based on a half-bridge topology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387990/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4970340","volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Single-phase active power filters for multiple nonlinear loads","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-phase active power filters for multiple nonlinear loads","sourcePdf":"00387990.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040686S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"160","articleId":"387990","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":387992,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

The discussion starts with a review of the fundamental limitation of switched-capacitor circuits which shows that the topology of such circuits and the \"forced\" step changes of capacitor voltages are the inherent attributes of power loss. Although the argument follows from a rather trivial result from basic circuit theory, it addresses an important issue on the maximum efficiency achievable in a switched-capacitor power converter circuit. Based on the observed topological constraint of switched-capacitor power converter circuits, the simplest lossless topology for AC/DC power conversion is deduced. Also discussed is a simple version of lossless topology that achieves isolation between the source and the load. Finally, an experimental AC/DC switched-capacitor power converter, based on the proposed idea, is presented which demonstrates an improved efficiency over other existing switched-capacitor power converters. The proposed AC/DC power converter contains no inductors and thus is suitable for custom IC implementation for very low power applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/387993/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","volume":"10","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4970343","publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On lossless switched-capacitor power converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On lossless switched-capacitor power converters","sourcePdf":"00387993.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039202S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"113","articleId":"387993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":387994,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-Fei Liu","affiliation":["Power Group, Bell Northern Research Limited, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Yan-Fei Liu","id":"37087143862"},{"name":"P.C.

A loss model of the inverter is developed based on experimental determination of the power losses. The loss model is used on two different modulation strategies which are a sine wave with a third harmonic added and a 60/spl deg/-PWM modulation where only two inverter legs are active at the same time. The two IGBT technologies are characterized on an advanced measurement system which is described. The total power losses in the inverter are estimated by simulation at different conditions and it is concluded that the nonpunch through (NPT) technology is most useful for higher switching frequencies, while the punch through (PT) technology is especially useful at lower switching frequencies and high load currents. It is also concluded that the 60/spl deg/-PWM modulation has the lowest power losses and the power losses are almost independent of phase angle cos(/spl phi/) for normal motor operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/63.388002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.388002","endPage":"367","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/8799/00388002.pdf","startPage":"358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power losses in PWM-VSI inverter using NPT or PT IGBT devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388002/","displayDocTitle":"Power losses in PWM-VSI inverter using NPT or PT IGBT devices","volume":"10","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4970352","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power losses in PWM-VSI inverter using NPT or PT IGBT devices","sourcePdf":"00388002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033106S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"192","articleId":"388002","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":388004,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This architecture uses N/sup 2/ multipliers to evaluate N/spl times/N-point DCTs at a rate of one complete transform per N clock cycles, where N is even. It possesses the features of regularity and modularity, and is thus well suited to VLSI implementation. As compared to existing pipelined regular architectures for the 2-D DCT, the proposed one has better throughput performance, smaller area-time complexity, and lower communication complexity. The new idea for the 2-D DCT is also extended to derive a similar systolic array for the 2-D inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 2-D DCT and IDCT architectures have good fixed-point error performance for both real image and random data. As a consequence, they are useful for applications where very high throughput rates are required.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/8802/00388063.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New systolic array implementation of the 2-D discrete cosine transform and its inverse","doi":"10.1109/76.388063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.388063","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=388063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388063/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"New systolic array implementation of the 2-D discrete cosine transform and its inverse","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4971224","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New systolic array implementation of the 2-D discrete cosine transform and its inverse","sourcePdf":"00388063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053452S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"33","articleId":"388063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":388064,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Instead of four possible patterns used by Kundu and Wu (1990), in the proposed approach 18 possible detection patterns represented as a decision tree are identified. The transmission error detection procedure is equivalent to tracing the decision tree. The estimated gray level shift of a detected streak noise is used to locate the streak origin. Then instead of using previous line replacement, each streak noise can be almost deleted by compensating the corrupted pixels with the estimated gray level shift.

Given the original and reproduced image as inputs, the model output is a numerical value that quantifies the visibility of blocking error in the reproduced image. The model is derived based on the human visual sensitivity to horizontal and vertical edge artifacts that result from blocking. Psychovisual experiments have been carried out to measure the visual sensitivity to these artifacts. In the experiments, typical edge artifacts are shown to subjects and the sensitivity to them is measured with the variation of background luminance, background activity, edge length, and edge amplitude. Synthetic test patterns are used as background images in the experiments. The sensitivity measures thus obtained are used to estimate the model parameters. The final model is tested on real images, and the results show that the error visibility predicted by the model correlates well with the subjective ranking.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.388074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8803/00388074.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.388074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8803","startPage":"713","endPage":"724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distortion measure for blocking artifacts in images based on human visual sensitivity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=388074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A distortion measure for blocking artifacts in images based on human visual sensitivity","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388074/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4990493","pubMedId":"18290022","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distortion measure for blocking artifacts in images based on human visual sensitivity","sourcePdf":"00388074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028669S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"8803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"206","articleId":"388074","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":388075,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Multi-resolution decomposition schemes have proven to be very effective for high-quality, low bit-rate image coding. In this work, we investigate the use of entropy-constrained trellis-coded quantization (ECTCQ) for encoding the wavelet coefficients of both monochrome and color images. ECTCQ is known as an effective scheme for quantizing memoryless sources with low to moderate complexity, The ECTCQ approach to data compression has led to some of the most effective source codes found to date for memoryless sources. Performance comparisons are made using the classical quadrature mirror filter bank of Johnston and nine-tap spline filters that were built from biorthogonal wavelet bases. We conclude that the encoded images obtained from the system employing nine-tap spline filters are marginally superior although at the expense of additional computational burden. Excellent peak-signal-to-noise ratios are obtained for encoding monochrome and color versions of the 512/spl times/512 \"Lenna\" image. Comparisons with other results from the literature reveal that the proposed wavelet coder is quite competitive.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8803/00388075.pdf","startPage":"725","endPage":"733","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.388075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.388075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8803","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=388075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image coding using wavelet transforms and entropy-constrained trellis-coded quantization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Filter bank","Spline","Quantization","Wavelet coefficients","Color","Data compression","Mirrors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image resolution","wavelet transforms","quantisation (signal)","entropy codes","trellis codes","source coding","band-pass filters","filtering theory","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transforms","entropy-constrained trellis-coded quantization","ECTCQ","multiresolution approximations","multiresolution decomposition","image decomposition","low bit-rate image coding","wavelet coefficients","color images","monochrome images","memoryless sources","data compression","source codes","performance comparisons","quadrature mirror filter bank","nine-tap spline filter","biorthogonal wavelet bases","peak-signal-to-noise ratios","wavelet coder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","displayDocTitle":"Image coding using wavelet transforms and entropy-constrained trellis-coded quantization","volume":"4","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4984156","pubMedId":"18290023","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image coding using wavelet transforms and entropy-constrained trellis-coded quantization","sourcePdf":"00388075.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061334S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"8803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"40","articleId":"388075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":388089,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

Difficulties arise because of the conflicting requirements of localization and labeling. Boundary localization usually demands observing the features over small neighborhoods, whereas labeling accuracy increases with the size of the observation neighborhood. This problem is further exacerbated in texture segmentation by the spatially distributed nature of texture features. In this correspondence, we develop a multiresolution approach that combines localized and distributed features to directly address boundary localization in texture segmentation. Maximum localization is achieved by using the gray-level discontinuities at the boundary between textures to define the boundary. The properties that characterize the gray-level discontinuity at texture boundaries are developed and an algorithm is designed to localize the boundary using these discontinuities. This segmentation algorithm is implemented and successfully tested on a set of Brodatz texture mosaics and AVHRR satellite imagery.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388089/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","volume":"4","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4984168","pubMedId":"18290036","publicationDate":"June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Boundary localization in texture segmentation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boundary localization in texture segmentation","sourcePdf":"00388089.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036113S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"8803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"9","articleId":"388089","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":388117,"authors":[{"name":"E.S.

The IC incorporates 64 sensor electrodes arranged in a symmetrical 8/spl times/8 matrix. Each electrode occupies a 400/spl times/400 /spl mu/m square area, and they are separated from each other by 300 /spl mu/m. A 40-/spl mu/m-thick piezoelectric PVDF polymer film was attached to the electrode array with an electrically nonconductive methane adhesive. The response of the tactile sensor is linear for loads spanning 0.8-135 grams-of-force (gmf) (0.00-1.35 Newtons (N)). The response bandwidth is 25 Hz, the hysteresis level is tolerable, and, for operation in the sensor's linear range, taxel crosstalk is negligible. The historically persistent stability and response reproducibility limitation associated with piezoelectric-based tactile sensors has been solved by implementing a novel pre-charge voltage bias technique to initialize the pre- and post-load sensor responses. A rudimentary tactile object image measurement procedure for applied loads has been devised to recognize the silhouette of a sharp edge, square, trapezoid, isosceles triangle, circle, toroid, slotted screw, and cross-slotted screw.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4984155","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Object imaging with a piezoelectric robotic tactile sensor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object imaging with a piezoelectric robotic tactile sensor","sourcePdf":"00388117.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06834S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"83","articleId":"388117","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":388130,"authors":[{"name":"K.G.

The delay problem occurs when the computing time delay is nonzero but smaller than the sampling interval, while the loss problem occurs when the computing time delay is greater than, or equal to, the sampling interval, i.e., loss of the control output. These two problems are analyzed as a means of evaluating real-time control systems.

In this study, a scheduling algorithm of determining data sampling times is developed using the window concept, where the sampled data from the control components in the ICCS share a limited number of windows, so that the performance requirement of each control loop is satisfied as well as the utilization of network resources is considerably increased.

In order to improve the environmental robustness of speech recognition in adverse conditions, a novel constrained-iterative feature-estimation algorithm is considered and shown to produce improved feature characterization in a variety of actual noise conditions. In addition, an objective measure based MAP estimator is formulated as a means of predicting changes in robust recognition performance at the speech feature extraction stage. The four measures considered include (i) NIST SNR; (ii) Itakura-Saito log-likelihood; (iii) log-area-ratio; (iv) the weighted-spectral slope measure. A continuous distribution, monophone based, hidden Markov model recognition algorithm is used for objective measure based MAP estimator analysis and recognition evaluation. Evaluations were based on speech data from the Credit Card corpus (CC-DATA). It is shown that feature enhancement provides a consistent level of recognition improvement for broadband, and low-frequency colored noise sources. As the stationarity assumption for a given noise source breaks down, the ability of feature enhancement to improve recognition performance decreases. Finally, the log-likelihood based MAP estimator was found to be the best predictor of recognition performance, while the NIST SNR based MAP estimator was found to be poorest recognition predictor across the 27 noise conditions considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/89.388143","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/8806/00388143.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.388143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8806","startPage":"169","endPage":"184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust feature-estimation and objective quality assessment for noisy speech recognition using the Credit Card corpus","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=388143","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust feature-estimation and objective quality assessment for noisy speech recognition using the Credit Card corpus","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388143/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4971843","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust feature-estimation and objective quality assessment for noisy speech recognition using the Credit Card corpus","sourcePdf":"00388143.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068159S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"24","articleId":"388143","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":388144,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

The first is the multiple-input/output inverse filtering theorem, which uses direct inversion of a matrix containing the coefficients of filters used to specify the electroacoustic transmission paths. The second is an adaptive technique based on the multiple error LMS algorithm. The theory presented reconciles the two approaches and furthermore, derives explicit conditions which must be fulfilled if an exact inverse is to exist. A formula is derived which gives the number of coefficients required in the inverse filters in terms of the number of coefficients used to represent the transmission paths. Some numerical examples are also presented which illustrate the dependence of the mean square error on both the choice of modeling delay and the number of coefficients in the inverse filters. Finally, the results of some simulations are given which demonstrate the acoustical possibilities associated with these filtering techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4971844","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Inverse filter design and equalization zones in multichannel sound reproduction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse filter design and equalization zones in multichannel sound reproduction","sourcePdf":"00388144.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036621S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"66","articleId":"388144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":388145,"authors":[{"name":"M.W.

The basic beamforming approach considered is constrained power minimization. The most important quality of this constrained adaptive processor is that the amount of cancellation of the desired signal is directly limited. The processor is designed as follows. An acceptable amount of cancellation of the desired signal is specified. Source models of anticipated types of array imperfections such as misteer, element placement uncertainty, and element response uncertainty are then derived from either modeled or measured array responses. These source models are the basis of both robust linear constraints as well as a single quadratic constraint that define the robust broadband spatial filter. The robust processor design is demonstrated for a headworn array of microphones (hearing aid). A simple, effective adaptive algorithm for processing speech input is also described. Small room reverberation and acoustic headshadow effects are included in the simulations. The resulting processor limits the amount of cancellation of the desired signal that occurs to the allowable amount in the presence of the array imperfections under all input SNR conditions. Effective attenuation of interfering sounds is also exhibited.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.388145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8806","startPage":"193","endPage":"203","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/8806/00388145.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust time-domain processing of broadband microphone array data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust time-domain processing of broadband microphone array data","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4971845","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust time-domain processing of broadband microphone array data","sourcePdf":"00388145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046963S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"21","articleId":"388145","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":388149,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In this paper we illustrate these two problems on a two-link flexible robot testbed by: 1) developing, implementing, and evaluating a fuzzy controller for the robotic mechanism, and 2) illustrating that payload variations can have negative effects on the performance of a well designed fuzzy control system. Next, we show how to develop and implement a fuzzy model reference learning controller for the flexible robot and illustrate that it can automatically synthesize a rule-base for a fuzzy controller that will achieve comparable performance to the case where it was manually constructed, and automatically tune the fuzzy controller so that it can adapt to variations in the payload.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.388164","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/8807/00388164.pdf","startPage":"199","endPage":"210","doi":"10.1109/91.388164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy learning control for a flexible-link robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy learning control for a flexible-link robot","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4977978","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388164/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy learning control for a flexible-link robot","sourcePdf":"00388164.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045698S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"94","articleId":"388164","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":388168,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Previous work using genetic algorithms has focused on the development of rule sets or high performance membership functions; however, the interdependence between these two components suggests a simultaneous design procedure would be a more appropriate methodology. When GA's have been used to develop both, it has been done serially, e.g., design the membership functions and then use them in the design of the rule set. This, however, means that the membership functions were optimized for the initial rule set and not the rule set designed subsequently. GA's are fully capable of creating complete fuzzy controllers given the equations of motion of the system, eliminating the need for human input in the design loop. This new method has been applied to two problems, a cart controller and a truck controller. Beyond the development of these controllers, we also examine the design of a robust controller for the cart problem and its ability to overcome faulty rules.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/91.388168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/8807/00388168.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.388168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous design of membership functions and rule sets for fuzzy controllers using genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388168/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous design of membership functions and rule sets for fuzzy controllers using genetic algorithms","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4977972","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous design of membership functions and rule sets for fuzzy controllers using genetic algorithms","sourcePdf":"00388168.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039422S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"487","articleId":"388168","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":388169,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In particular, any given linear control can be achieved with a fuzzy controller for a given accuracy. The aim of this paper is to show how to automatically build this fuzzy controller. The proposed design methodology is detailed for the synthesis of a Sugeno or Mamdani type fuzzy controller precisely equivalent to a given PI controller. The main idea is to equate the output of the fuzzy controller with the output of the PI controller at some particular input values, called modal values. The rule base and the distribution of the membership functions can thus be deduced. The analytic expression of the output of the generated fuzzy controller is then established. For Sugeno-type fuzzy controllers, precise equivalence is directly obtained. For Mamdani-type fuzzy controllers, the defuzzification strategy and the inference operators have to be correctly chosen to provide linear interpolation between modal values. The usual inference operators satisfying the linearity requirement when using the center of gravity defuzzification method are proposed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/91.388169","startPage":"140","endPage":"148","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.388169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8807","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/8807/00388169.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy controllers: synthesis and equivalences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388169/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy controllers: synthesis and equivalences","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4977973","publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy controllers: synthesis and equivalences","sourcePdf":"00388169.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052538S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"177","articleId":"388169","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-29"},{"_id":388171,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun Mun Kim","affiliation":["Signal and Image Processing Institute of Electrical Engineering Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Hyun Mun Kim","id":"37616098500"},{"name":"J.M.

In particular, a FBF network is compared with a radial basis function (RBF) network from the viewpoint of function approximation. Their architectural interrelationships are discussed. Additionally, a RBF network, which is implemented using a regularization technique, is compared with a FBF network from the viewpoint of overcoming ill-posed problems. A FBF network is also compared with Specht's probabilistic neural network and his general regression neural network (GRNN) from an architectural point of view.

The connectionist structure can house fuzzy logic rules and membership functions for fuzzy inference. We use /spl alpha/-level sets of fuzzy numbers to represent linguistic information. The inputs, outputs, and weights of the proposed network can be fuzzy numbers of any shape. Furthermore, they can be hybrid of fuzzy numbers and numerical numbers through the use of fuzzy singletons. Based on interval arithmetics, two kinds of learning schemes are developed for the proposed system: fuzzy supervised learning and fuzzy reinforcement learning. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance and applicability of the proposed system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/91.388172","startPage":"169","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/8807/00388172.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.388172","endPage":"189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural fuzzy system with linguistic teaching signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388172/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"A neural fuzzy system with linguistic teaching signals","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4977976","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural fuzzy system with linguistic teaching signals","sourcePdf":"00388172.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078307S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"68","articleId":"388172","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":388173,"authors":[{"name":"Yinghua Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Socorro, NM, USA"],"lastName":"Yinghua Lin","id":"37366762400"},{"name":"G.A.

We first give an analysis of fuzzy basic functions (FBF's) and present several properties of FBF's. Based on these properties of FBF's, we obtain several basic approximation properties of fuzzy systems: 1) basic approximation property which reveals the basic approximation mechanism of fuzzy systems; 2) uniform approximation bounds which give the uniform approximation bounds between the desired (control or decision) functions and fuzzy systems; 3) uniform convergent property which shows that fuzzy systems with defined approximation accuracy can always be obtained by dividing the input space into finer fuzzy regions; and 4) universal approximation property which shows that fuzzy systems are universal approximators and extends some previous results on this aspect. The similarity between fuzzy systems and mathematical approximation is discussed and an idea to improve approximation accuracy is suggested based on uniform approximation bounds.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/91.388175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/8807/00388175.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.388175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximation theory of fuzzy systems-MIMO case","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=388175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388175/","displayDocTitle":"Approximation theory of fuzzy systems-MIMO case","volume":"3","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4977980","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximation theory of fuzzy systems-MIMO case","sourcePdf":"00388175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049231S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"268","articleId":"388175","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":388178,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

Control complexity and driving losses are the main constraints of this technique.

The absence of control circuitry and the minimization of losses are the main benefits of this circuit, whose analysis and optimization are addressed.

This flexibility provides for more efficient use of resources, but makes control of these systems more difficult. Control problems previously unstudied now require practical resolution, like system deadlock. A system deadlock is a situation that arises due to resource sharing in manufacturing systems, when the flow of parts is permanently inhibited and/or operations on parts cannot be performed. This problem has been ignored by most scheduling and control studies, which usually assume infinite machine queue capacity and unlimited tooling resources. FMS's, however, have little or no queue capacity and limited tooling resources. In this paper, graph-theoretic deadlock detection and resolution procedures are presented which are suitable for real-time control of manufacturing systems. These procedures determine whether part movement in the system causes system deadlock or not. To this end, a system status graph representing part routings is virtually updated for every part movement before parts move physically to the next destination. Two types of system deadlocks, part flow deadlock and impending part flow deadlock, are detected using the updated system status graph. If a deadlock detection and recovery method is used to recover from a deadlock using a storage buffer, only part flow deadlocks need to be detected. On the other hand, if no buffer is available, both types of existing as well as impending system deadlocks need to be detected to avoid a deadlock situation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/8824/00388784.pdf","startPage":"413","endPage":"421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.388784","doi":"10.1109/70.388784","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=388784","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System recovery","Flexible manufacturing systems","Buffer storage","Manufacturing systems","Control systems","Job shop scheduling","Resource management","Industrial engineering","Real time systems","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible manufacturing systems","graph theory","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph-theoretic deadlock detection","deadlock resolution","flexible manufacturing systems","FMS","resource sharing","limited machine queue capacity","limited tooling resources","real-time control","system status graph","part routings","impending part flow deadlock","deadlock recovery","storage buffer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388784/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Graph-theoretic deadlock detection and resolution for flexible manufacturing systems","accessionNumber":"5002363","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph-theoretic deadlock detection and resolution for flexible manufacturing systems","sourcePdf":"00388784.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025885S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"102","articleId":"388784","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":388844,"authors":[{"name":"Hsien-Tsai Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsien-Tsai Wu","id":"37086970948"},{"name":"Jar-Ferr Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jar-Ferr Yang","id":"37086982541"},{"name":"Fwu-Kuen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fwu-Kuen Chen","id":"37088105257"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"388844","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":206,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1007},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=388844","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Detectors","White noise","Yield estimation","Radar signal processing","Multiple signal classification","Testing","Covariance matrix","Gunshot detection systems","Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection","maximum likelihood estimation","signal resolution","covariance matrices","white noise","Gaussian noise","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","transforms","array signal processing","information theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source number estimators","transformed Gerschgorin radii","unitary transformed covariance matrix","source number estimation","detection criteria","detection performance","white noise process","Gaussian noise process","Gerschgorin likelihood estimators","Gerschgorin MDL criterion","data samples","heuristic approach","Gerschgorin disk estimator","projection concept","rotations","averaging","measured experimental data","simulated data","Gerschgorin AIC","eigenvalue"]}],"doi":"10.1109/78.388844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8826/00388844.pdf","startPage":"1325","endPage":"1333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.388844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Source number estimators using transformed Gerschgorin radii","abstract":"We introduce effective uses of Gerschgorin radii of the unitary transformed covariance matrix for source number estimation. There are two approaches, likelihood and heuristic, used for developing the detection criteria. The likelihood approach combines the Gerschgorin radii to the well-known source number detectors and improves their detection performances for Gaussian and white noise processes. It is verified that the Gerschgorin likelihood estimators (GLE) are consistent. The Gerschgorin AIC yields a consistent estimate and the Gerschgorin MDL criterion does not tend to underestimate for small or moderate data samples. The heuristic approach applying the Gerschgorin disk estimator (GDE) developed from the projection concept, overcomes the problem in cases of small data samples, an unknown noise model, and data dependency. Furthermore, the detection performances of both approaches through the suggested rotations and averaging can be further improved. Finally, the proposed and existing criteria are evaluated in various conditions by using simulated and measured experimental data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388844/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","volume":"43","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"5002857","publicationDate":"June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Source number estimators using transformed Gerschgorin radii","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source number estimators using transformed Gerschgorin radii","sourcePdf":"00388844.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064751S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"206","articleId":"388844","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":388848,"authors":[{"name":"I.

This results in a linearly constrained optimization problem. To ensure a maximally flat spatial response of a specified order in the look direction of the PB processor, additional constraints known as derivative constraints can be further imposed on the weights. In general, derivative constraints corresponding to necessary and sufficient (NS) conditions for a maximally flat spatial power response can result in a quadratic equality constrained optimization problem. We transform the quadratic NS derivative constraints to parameterized linear forms. These parameterized linear forms allow the global optimum of the quadratic equality constrained optimization problem to be obtained easily. They also provide a general framework for deriving new sets of derivative constraints which correspond only to sufficient conditions for a maximally flat spatial power response. These sufficient derivative constraints are useful for real-time processing because of their reduced computational requirements and because they ran deliver performance comparable to the NS derivative constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388848/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","volume":"43","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"5002858","publicationDate":"June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Constraints for maximally flat optimum broadband antenna arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constraints for maximally flat optimum broadband antenna arrays","sourcePdf":"00388848.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041911S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"13","articleId":"388848","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":388849,"authors":[{"name":"C.

After pointing out the connection between designing an M-fold interpolator and the construction of an M-channel perfect reconstruction filter bank, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the signal under which exact interpolation is possible. Bandlimited signals are one obvious example, but numerous others exist. We examine these and show how the interpolators may be constructed. A main application is to iterative interpolation schemes, used for the efficient generation of smooth curves. We show that conventional bandlimited interpolators are not suitable in this context. A better criterion is to use interpolators that are exact for polynomial functions. We demonstrate that these interpolators converge when iterated, and show how these may be designed for any polynomial degree N and any interpolation factor M. This makes it possible to design interpolators for iterative schemes to make best use of the resolution available in a given display medium.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8826/00388849.pdf","startPage":"1348","endPage":"1359","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.388849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.388849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=388849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact interpolation and iterative subdivision schemes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Polynomials","Signal resolution","Displays","Signal design","Filter bank","Sufficient conditions","Maximum likelihood detection","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal sampling","interpolation","iterative methods","band-pass filters","filtering theory","polynomials","convergence of numerical methods","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative subdivision","exact interpolation","discrete-time signal","M-fold interpolator","M-channel perfect reconstruction filter bank","sufficient conditions","necessary conditions","bandlimited signals","iterative interpolation","smooth curves","bandlimited interpolators","polynomial functions","interpolation factor","polynomial degree","resolution","display medium","convergence","sampling properties","periodic non-uniform sampling","multidimensional signals"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Exact interpolation and iterative subdivision schemes","volume":"43","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"5002859","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact interpolation and iterative subdivision schemes","sourcePdf":"00388849.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038744S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","articleId":"388849","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":388851,"authors":[{"name":"N.R.

This technique, which is an approximation to the conventional look-ahead computation, maintains functionality of the algorithm rather than the input-output behavior. Thus, it results in substantial hardware savings as compared to either parallel processing or look-ahead techniques. Pipelining of the decision feedback loop and the adaptation loop is achieved by the use of delay relaxation and sum relaxation. Both the conventional and the predictor form of ADFE have been pipelined. Results of the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithms are also provided. The performance of the pipelined algorithms for the equalization of a magnetic recording channel is studied. It is shown that the conventional ADFE results in an SNR loss of about 0.6 dB per unit increase in the speed-up factor. The predictor form of ADFE is much more robust and results in less than 0.1 dB SNR loss per unit increase in the speed-up factor. Speed-ups of up to 8 and 45 have been demonstrated for the conventional and predictor forms of ADFE.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.388851","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8826/00388851.pdf","startPage":"1368","endPage":"1385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.388851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=388851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipelined adaptive DFE architectures using relaxed look-ahead","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388851/","displayDocTitle":"Pipelined adaptive DFE architectures using relaxed look-ahead","volume":"43","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5002861","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipelined adaptive DFE architectures using relaxed look-ahead","sourcePdf":"00388851.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05123S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"22","articleId":"388851","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":388854,"authors":[{"name":"Wenyuan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Wenyuan Xu","id":"37349748600"},{"name":"M.

In contrast, cyclic mean and correlation statistics have proved to be useful for harmonic retrieval in the presence of multiplicative and additive noise of arbitrary color and distribution. Performance analysis of cyclic estimators is carried through both for nonzero and zero mean multiplicative noises. Cyclic estimators are shown to be asymptotically equivalent to certain nonlinear least squares estimators, and are also compared with the maximum likelihood ones. Large sample variance expressions of the cyclic estimators are derived and compared with the corresponding Cramer-Rao bounds when the noises are white Gaussian. It is demonstrated that previously well established results on constant amplitude harmonics are special cases of the present analysis. Simulations not only validate the large sample performance analysis, but also provide concrete examples regarding relative statistical efficiency of the cyclic estimators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harmonics in multiplicative and additive noise: performance analysis of cyclic estimators","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.388857","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8826/00388857.pdf","startPage":"1445","endPage":"1460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.388857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=388857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388857/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Harmonics in multiplicative and additive noise: performance analysis of cyclic estimators","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"5002867","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonics in multiplicative and additive noise: performance analysis of cyclic estimators","sourcePdf":"00388857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045918S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"76","articleId":"388857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":388858,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The method is fast, simple, recursive and can be used in the design of 1D or 2D zero-phase FIR filters by imposing some mild constraints on sample locations in the 2D frequency plane. Based on a novel Newton representation of the filter transfer function the proposed method guarantees real results, saves a number of operations and produces accurate solutions even in cases of designing high-order filters or when the interpolation matrix is ill-conditioned. In the progressive case when the next sample appears, the design parameters are evaluated by updating the old ones with correction terms that could be used as indicators for convergence, approximation, or filter reduction. The method can be used in mD filter design, in LU-factorization or in inversion of cosine matrices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.388858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.388858","startPage":"1461","endPage":"1467","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8826/00388858.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A recursive frequency-sampling method for designing zero-phase FIR filters by nonuniform samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"A recursive frequency-sampling method for designing zero-phase FIR filters by nonuniform samples","publicationDate":"June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"43","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5002868","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388858/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A recursive frequency-sampling method for designing zero-phase FIR filters by nonuniform samples","sourcePdf":"00388858.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033092S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","articleId":"388858","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":388860,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Jun Zhang","id":"37087165485"},{"name":"G.G.

The major problem associated with the most commonly used form of the Gabor representation is that it assumes that signals have integer arrival times and modulation frequencies-an assumption that, if violated, causes signal miss-match and deterioration in detector performance. The present correspondence presents the concept of oversampling the Gabor representation, which makes the representation more robust to certain types of signal mismatch. To show this, the performance of an oversampled Gabor detector is compared to that of critically sampled Gabor detectors. Gabor coefficients are calculated in the oversampled representation via the least squares method, which has been shown to be superior to the more commonly used biorthogonal function method in terms of corresponding detector performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.388862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.388862","startPage":"1498","endPage":"1502","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8826/00388862.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust transient signal detection using the oversampled Gabor representation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Robust transient signal detection using the oversampled Gabor representation","publicationDate":"June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"43","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5002871","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388862/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust transient signal detection using the oversampled Gabor representation","sourcePdf":"00388862.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029133S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","articleId":"388862","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":388864,"authors":[{"name":"T.

However, only one iteration and coefficient update is done for every sample of data. This, coupled with the fact that the CG method used does not require a line search makes it very efficient in computation.

What are wavelets, and why might they be useful to you? The fundamental idea behind wavelets is to analyze according to scale. Indeed, some researchers feel that using wavelets means adopting a whole new mind-set or perspective in processing data. Wavelets are functions that satisfy certain mathematical requirements and are used in representing data or other functions. Most of the basic wavelet theory has now been done. The mathematics have been worked out in excruciating detail, and wavelet theory is now in the refinement stage. This involves generalizing and extending wavelets, such as in extending wavelet packet techniques. The future of wavelets lies in the as-yet uncharted territory of applications. Wavelet techniques have not been thoroughly worked out in such applications as practical data analysis, where, for example, discretely sampled time-series data might need to be analyzed. Such applications offer exciting avenues for exploration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/388960/","volume":"2","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5005870","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Summer 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An introduction to wavelets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An introduction to wavelets","sourcePdf":"00388960.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042139S","chronDate":"Summer 1995","isNumber":"8829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"99","citationCount":"841","articleId":"388960","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":389062,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The authors have already proposed a parallel processing algorithm for HMM-based speech recognition using Markov random fields (MRF). The parallel processing is realized by modeling the hidden state sequence by an MRF and using the iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithm to estimate the optimal state sequence given an observation sequence. However this parallel processing algorithm is applicable only to the standard HMM but not to the linear predictive HMM which takes into account the correlations between nearby observation vectors. The authors propose a parallel processing algorithm applicable to the correlation-considered HMM, where a new deterministic relaxation algorithm is used instead of the ICM algorithm for estimation of the optimal state sequence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389223","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

We investigated (1) the effect of varying the number of training speakers if the total amount of training data remains constant, (2) data pooling versus model averaging for generating speaker-independent (SI) HMMs, (3) the benefit of doubling the acoustic training data, (4) SI versus SD performance when the SI training data is twelve times greater, (5) the effect of cross-domain training for both the acoustic and language models. Our recent work was focused on four specific problem areas sharing the common thread that the test condition exposes the recognizer to phenomena not observed in the training data. Here we investigated (1) words outside the vocabulary, (2) spoken language effects due to subject variability and spontaneous dictation, (3) non-native dialects of the language, and (4) new microphones not used in training.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/389232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"i","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4916191","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparative experiments on large vocabulary speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative experiments on large vocabulary speech recognition","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00389232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05572S","chronDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3104","citationCount":"17","articleId":"389232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":389235,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Specifically, semi-continuous HMMs (SCHMMs) with phone-dependent VQ codebooks are presented and incorporated into the SPHINX-II speech recognition system. The phone-dependent VQ codebooks relax the density-tying constraint in SCHMMs in order to obtain more detailed models. A 6% error rate reduction was achieved on the speaker-independent 20000-word Wall Street Journal (WSJ) task. Dynamic adaptation of the language model in the context of long documents is also explored. A maximum entropy framework is used to exploit long distance trigrams and trigger effects. A 10%-15% word error rate reduction is reported on the same WSJ task using the adaptive language modeling technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

On the other hand, for non alphabetic languages like Chinese, there is no convenient input method. Therefore, dictation may already be a more appealing input method, for Chinese. In this paper, we demonstrate that our sub-syllable HMM recognizer and tone classifier are able to yield state-of-the-art Mandarin Chinese syllable and tone recognition performance (95.7% for syllables and 98.9% for tones). By combining the HMM syllable recognizer and tone classifier, the tonal syllable result (94%) appears adequate for a syllable base dictation machine. Finally, to alleviate the homophone problem of syllable dictation, we developed a high-performance 5,000-word recognition system with 93% accuracy for the correct answer and 99% accuracy for the top 3 candidates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

Undesirable components due to ambient noise and channel interference, as well as different sound pick-up equipments, render the recognizer unsuitable for real-world applications. This paper presents a signal bias removal method based on the maximum likelihood estimation for the minimization of these undesirable effects. The proposed method, integrated into a discrete density HMM, is applied to telephone speech recognition where the contamination due to ambient noise and channel distortion are assumed to be unknown. Experimental results are presented for speaker-independent connected digit recognition which demonstrate a reduction in the word error rate by up to 40%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/389260/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"i","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4916163","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Signal bias removal for robust telephone based speech recognition in adverse environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal bias removal for robust telephone based speech recognition in adverse environments","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00389260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027166S","chronDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3104","citationCount":"19","articleId":"389260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":389261,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We extend our previously reported work in two directions. First, a comparison of normalisation functions demonstrates that the root-based cepstral representation can still be significantly enhanced by an appropriate reinforcement of the most energetic speech portions, leading to a 10-15% increase in performance on raw data Second, we extend this concept and propose two root-adaptive schemes. Recognition tests demonstrate the noise robustness of the proposed analysis that further improves the results by a significant amount.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/389261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4916162","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"i","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Root adaptive homomorphic deconvolution schemes for speech recognition in noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Root adaptive homomorphic deconvolution schemes for speech recognition in noise","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00389261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043655S","chronDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3104","citationCount":"5","articleId":"389261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":389262,"authors":[{"name":"W.C.

First we compare RASTA processing and cepstrum mean subtraction as preprocessing methods, to compensate for unknown channel transfer function effects, when we have no information about the new microphone. Then we introduce a new algorithm that computes a probabilistic transformation from the training microphone codebook to that of a new microphone, given some information about the new microphone. We test this algorithm in supervised mode and, combined with a microphone selection method, in unsupervised mode. We present experimental results which show that the proposed algorithm combined with cepstrum mean subtraction, improves the recognition accuracy when the system is tested on a microphone with different characteristics than the one on which it was trained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389263","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

It consists of a continuous spectral subtraction (CSS) scheme integrated into a parallel model combination (PMC) compensation framework. In this CSS-PMC scheme, a smoothed estimate of the long term spectrum is continuously calculated and subtracted from the signal. At the same time, the HMMs are compensated using PMC for the signal distortion caused by the CSS stage. The paper presents an evaluation of the CSS-PMC approach using the Noisex 92 database. The results show high recognition performance for very noisy environments. For example, for the Lynx helicopter noise, CSS-PMC gives 97% accuracy at 0 dB SNR.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/389269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4916154","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"i","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Continuous speech recognition in noise using spectral subtraction and HMM adaptation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous speech recognition in noise using spectral subtraction and HMM adaptation","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00389269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049048S","chronDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3104","citationCount":"17","articleId":"389269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":389273,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

In an actual application, the performance of the connected digit recognizer must be measured along two dimensions: its recognition accuracy over connected digit strings, and its rejection rate over utterances with no digits. This paper presents a rejection method for connected digit recognition. This rejection method is a post-processor to an HMM-based recognizer and consists of two stages: a digit/non-digit classification stage, and a string verification stage. The digit/non-digit classifier is discriminatively trained to determine if a given digit segment in the recognized string actually contains a digit. The string verification stage combines the results of the digit/non-digit classifier to make the final rejection decision. Experimental results on two independent databases, show that this rejection method is successful in not only rejecting speech with no connected digits, but also in rejecting putative errors, which would have resulted in misrecognition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389273","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

The first technique is based on ergodic discrete density hidden Markov models (HMM) which can be applied to bigrams based on word categories. This statistical approach of the so-called Markov bigrams enables an efficient unsupervised learning procedure for the bigram probabilities with the well-known Baum-Welch algorithm. Furthermore, maximizing the model-conditional probability is equivalent to minimizing the perplexity of the training corpus. The second technique is based on polygrams which are an extension of the bigram (n=2) or trigram (n=3) grammars to any possible value of n. According to the smoothing techniques for bigram or trigram models, the probabilities of the n-grams in the polygram model are interpolated using the relative frequencies of all n'-grams with n'/spl les/n. Both techniques were evaluated on the ATIS corpus by computing the test set perplexity. Furthermore the authors integrated the Markov bigrams as well as the polygrams into their word recognizer for continuous speech. Experimental results on a German database are discussed using the N-best paradigm to reorder the generated word sequences according to the sentence probability of the language model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

Because of the flexibility permitted by CDMA to easily convey the information stream over a VR physical channel, the fixed-rate constraint has been removed from the speech coding algorithm design, in order to exploit the time-varying local character of speech. One major feature of the proposed algorithm is the possibility for the average rate to be either source-controlled or network-controlled.

Our approach is based on continuous density hidden Markov models with a non-linear input feature transformation performed by a multilayer perceptron. We discuss various optimisation criteria and provide results on a TIMIT phoneme recognition task, using single frame (mutual information or relative entropy) MMI embedded in Viterbi training, and a global MMI criterion. As expected, global MMI is found superior to the frame-based criterion for continuous recognition. We further observe that optimal sentence decoding is essential to achieve maximum recognition rate for models trained by global MMI. Finally, we find that the simple MLP input transformation, with five frames of context information, can increase the recognition rate significantly compared to just using delta parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/389314/","accessionNumber":"4910116","isConference":true,"volume":"i","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Non-linear input transformations for discriminative HMMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-linear input transformations for discriminative HMMs","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00389314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067524S","chronDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3104","citationCount":"4","articleId":"389314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":389315,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Huo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Qing Huo","id":"38231306800"},{"name":"Chorkin Chan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Chorkin Chan","id":"37351256700"},{"name":"Chin-Hui Lee","affiliation":["Speech Research Department, AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Chin-Hui Lee","id":"37280405600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1775-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"389315","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Speech recognition","Hidden Markov models","Parameter estimation","Covariance matrix","Laboratories","Smoothing methods","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","parameter estimation","hidden Markov models","Bayes methods","adaptive systems","estimation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SCHMM parameters","speech recognition","semi-continuous HMM parameters","Bayesian adaptive learning","MAP estimation","hyperparameters estimation","moment estimate","speaker adaptation","experiments","English alphabet vocabulary","HMM training","sequential training","context adaptation","parameter smoothing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389315","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

The final score is a weighted sum of the contributions of every stream. These weights can be found empirically and usually the same set of weights is used for every acoustic model. There is reason to believe that there are features which are more important for some acoustic models than for others. Especially one would expect the beginning and ending segment of a phoneme to be more context dependent than the middle part, so in that case the probability estimator of the speech recognizer should put more emphasis on the delta-spectrum than on the spectrum. Experiments have shown that spectral or cepstral coefficients are more important than their derivatives and more important than power or delta-power coefficients. We propose an algorithm for learning individual stream weights for every HMM state. Since these individual weights are a superset of the stream-only dependent weights, they can reproduce the results of the stream-only dependent weights and, additionally, discriminate between HMM states. Thus, the recognition performance must improve.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8833","startPage":"I/217","endPage":"I/220 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

The approach uses a combination of time domain (linear prediction; pitch prediction) and frequency domain (transform coding; dynamic bit allocation) techniques, and utilizes a synthesis model similar to that of linear prediction coders such as CELP. However, at the encoder, the high complexity analysis-by-synthesis technique is bypassed by directly quantizing the so-called target signal in the frequency domain. The innovative excitation is derived at the decoder by inverse filtering the quantized target signal. The algorithm is intended for applications whereby a large number of bits is available for the innovative excitation. The TCX algorithm is utilized to encode wideband speech and audio signals with a 50-7000 Hz bandwidth. Novel quantization procedures including inter-frame prediction in the frequency domain are proposed to encode the target signal. The proposed algorithm achieves very high quality for speech at 16 kbits/s, and for music at 24 kbits/s.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389322","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

The short-term prediction of speech in speech coders is extensively based on linear models, e.g. the linear predictive coding technique (LPC), which is one of the most basic elements in modern speech coders. This technique does not allow extraction of nonlinear dependencies. If nonlinearities are absent from speech the technique is sufficient, but if the speech contains nonlinearities the technique is inadequate. The authors give evidence for nonlinearities in speech and propose nonlinear short-term predictors that can substitute the LPC technique. The technique, called nonlinear predictive coding, is shown to be superior to the LPC technique. Two different nonlinear predictors are presented. The first is based on a second-order Volterra filter, and the second is based on a time delay neural network. The latter is shown to be the more suitable for speech coding applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389324","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

Speaker segmentation is performed using Viterbi decoding on a hidden Markov model network consisting of interconnected speaker sub-networks. Speaker sub-networks are initialized using Baum-Welch training on data labeled by speaker, and are iteratively retrained based on the previous segmentation. If data labeled by speaker is not available, agglomerative clustering is used to approximately segment the conversational speech according to speaker prior to Baum-Welch training. The distance measure for the clustering is a likelihood ratio in which speakers are modeled by Gaussian distributions. The distance between merged segments is recomputed at each stage of the clustering, and a duration model is used to bias the likelihood ratio.

In addition to comparing recognition accuracy we use telephone-channel simulation to identify the sources of degradation of speech over telephone lines that have the greatest impact on speech recognition accuracy. We first compare the performance of the CMU SPHINX-I system on the TIMIT and NTIMIT databases. We found that other factors beyond a mere decrease in bandwidth cause the observed degradation in recognition accuracy, and that the environmental compensation algorithms RASTA and CDCN fail to compensate completely for degradations introduced by the telephone network. We identify the most problematic telephone-channel impairments using a commercial telephone channel simulator and the SPHINX-II system. Of the various effects considered, additive noise and linear filtering appear to have the greatest impact on recognition accuracy. Finally, we examined the performance of three cepstral compensation algorithms in the presence of the most damaging conditions. We found the compensation algorithms to be effective except for the worst 1% of the telephone channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/389343/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4910087","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"i","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sources of degradation of speech recognition in the telephone network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sources of degradation of speech recognition in the telephone network","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00389343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048145S","chronDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3104","citationCount":"22","articleId":"389343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":389344,"authors":[{"name":"E.R.

In the past few years, several highly successful techniques for recognizing spoken connected digit strings have been proposed. Although these techniques have been applied to non-telephone based speech [e.g. Texas Instruments database], they have produced high recognition performance. Further, similar levels of performances have been demonstrated using discrete density and continuous density based hidden Markov models (HMMs). The success of the vector quantized (VQ) modeling approach, in particular, is encouraging and rather important from the viewpoint of computational efficiency. This paper presents a study of connected digit recognition on telephone network based data using VQ HMMs. We investigate several factors affecting the error rate of VQ HMMs-such as maximum mutual information (MMI) training, sender modeling, and codebook size-and measure their contributions to recognition accuracy. The model architecture, number of states and transitions, is also optimized and its contribution to overall performance discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389344","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

The word accent patterns are represented by concatenation of mora hidden Markov models for fundamental frequency feature sequences. The mora HMMs are trained by accent-related features automatically extracted without manual correction from the speech wave. These algorithms are evaluated using a speech sample set consisting of 10 speakers' 121 words, where word accent patterns are classified by listening. All words have 4 mora and are selected from a phonetically balanced word set. Two experiments are performed to compare the automatically extracted features with the features manually corrected in unvoiced parts of the speech wave. Little difference was found in the results obtained using the two different features, indicating that the mora HMMs using automatically extracted features are useful for representing and identifying word accent patterns.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389353","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

Besides, it is not clear the superiority of continuous models over other well-known types of HMMs, such as discrete (DHMM) or semicontinuous (SCHMM) models, or multiple vector quantization (MVQ) models, a new type of HMM modeling. The authors propose a new variant of HMM models, the SCMVQ, HMM models (semicontinuous multiple vector quantization HMM), that uses one VQ codebook per recognition unit and several quantization candidates, Formally, SCMVQ modeling is the closest one to CHMM, although requiring less computation than SCHMMs. Besides, the authors show that SCMVQs can obtain better recognition results than DHMMs, SCHMMs or MVQs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

IHMMs can capture the temporal structure of phonemes and inter-phonemic temporal relationships effectively, with their duration dependent state transition probabilities. A two stage IHMM is proposed to capture the variabilities in speech effectively for phoneme recognition. The first stage models the acoustic and durational variabilities of all distinct sub-phonemic segments and the second stage models the acoustic and durational variability of the whole phoneme. In an experimental evaluation of the new scheme for recognizing a subset of alphabets comprising of the most confusing set of phonemes, spoken randomly and continuously, a phoneme recognition accuracy of 83% is observed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389360","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

A recurrent net is used to map acoustic vectors to posterior probabilities of phone classes. The maximum likelihood phone or word string is then extracted using Markov models. The paper describes three improvements: connectionist model merging; explicit presentation of acoustic context; and improved duration modelling. The first is shown to provide a significant improvement in the TIMIT phone recognition rate and all three provide an improvement in the WSJ word recognition rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

It is shown that the best index assignment, on the encoder, is obtained in the special case of a linear mapping from the soft information bits.

Considering the absence of results for these laws in the literature, the authors constructed adapted statistical tools for DCT coefficients analysis. Then, they show that these coefficients can be modelized by a Gaussian finite mixture distribution.

The criterion chosen for the optimization is the maximization of the integrated sidelobe ratio (ISLR), defined as the ratio between the energy of the mainlobe and the energy of the sidelobes of the system impulse response. The choice of the ISLR allows us to take into account, in the optimization procedure, two important quality factors: resolution and contrast. The nonuniform spacing of the resulting optimized array breaks the regularity responsible for the formation of the so called grating lobes. The method can then be used also as a tool for reducing the number of elements in an array strictly necessary for achieving some desired performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389424","startPage":"V/157","endPage":"V/160 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

Lost blocks of transform coefficients are reconstructed via linear interpolation using the same coefficients from adjacent blocks, thus preserving high frequency details and local image characteristics. Determination of the interpolation coefficients, or weights, is combined with vector quantization in a single step at the encoder, and the resulting quantized weights are transmitted as overhead information. The required transmission overhead is less than 10% for typical JPEG-coded images, and the computation for reconstruction of a block is less than that required for simply decoding a block using an inverse discrete cosine transform. This technique is applicable to both luminance and chrominance components, and the reconstructed images maintain good visual quality at loss rates as high as 30%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389436","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

A new algorithm for estimating the background texture of uncovered areas is proposed which exploits spatial correlation in addition to temporal correlation and motion information. The surrounding known background area is analysed and spatially extrapolated using a highly efficient spectral domain extrapolation algorithm. The method avoids inherent insufficiencies of conventional static background memories such as strong sensitivity to camera zoom and pan and it can be incorporated into any existing motion compensating coding concept. Several prediction results for typical moving image sequences demonstrate the applicability of the proposed concept.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/389461/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4956946","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"v","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient prediction of uncovered background in interframe coding using spatial extrapolation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient prediction of uncovered background in interframe coding using spatial extrapolation","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00389461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033166S","chronDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3104","citationCount":"20","articleId":"389461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":389464,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Although optimal sampling at below Nyquist density is possible through a process of periodic sample deletion, the resulting irregular sampling pattern has limited utility in real-world applications. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed to perform uniform sampling of the data at below Nyquist density, yet allows for perfect reconstruction of the signal. By exploring the special signal structure of sinograms in computer aided tomography, the technique is used for signal reconstruction from sinograms sampled at below Nyquist rate.

This algorithm improves upon the traditional approach of using the motion estimates that are obtained separately as input for scene segmentation. Based on the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) criterion, the interdependence of constraints for motion estimation and scene segmentation are expressed in a Gibbs distribution. The solution is obtained based on the highest confidence first (HCF) and iterated conditional mode (ICM) optimization methods. Experimental results suggest that this algorithm is of potential use for low-bit rate video coding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389492","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

For representing gray-tone images on bilevel displays or printers, the gray-tone images need to be transformed into binary images by using halftoning techniques. Visually pleasing halftone images must have both a high spatial resolution and a high gray level resolution. In this method, a halftoning technique is regarded as an optimizing problem that is to search for a visually pleasing distribution of white and black pixels. In the study, spatial and gray level resolutions of halftone images are evaluated, and then the evaluated value is optimized by using GA. For demonstrating an efficacy of the proposed two halftoning techniques, the results obtained by a computer simulation are shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389556","pdfPath":"/iel2/3104/8834/00389556.pdf","startPage":"V/105","endPage":"V/108 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

One particular problem that occurs in on-line recognition tasks is how to deal with input patterns that are incorrectly recognized because they are totally dissimilar to anything the network has seen during training. The author presents an algorithm to add incremental, one-shot learning capability to the TDNN by creating extra hidden units to perform template matching on incorrectly recognized inputs and influence the output units via excitatory or inhibitory connections. In a simple handwritten digit recognition task, the addition of a single extra unit increases recognition rate for a new digit variation from 0% to 99%, while decreasing the performance on the old data by only 0.6%. Thus this incremental TDNN (ITDNN) can in fact learn a new pattern from one example and perform reasonably well on similar inputs without forgetting what it already knew, thereby enabling it to deal effectively with the on-line misrecognition problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389577","startPage":"II/629","endPage":"II/632 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

Structure classification is the first step required for any system that is designed to measure cardiac parameters. Described here is a multiple feature, hierarchical, fuzzy neural network fusion solution to the problem. The system 'learns' to classify tissue types by examination of image training data. Classification assigns each image pixel a fuzzy membership measure for each structure or tissue type. Final hard classification, if required, is delayed until the system's output stage. This allows important \"fuzzy\" information to be retained throughout the system. The first layer in the hierarchy of networks determines gross spatial relationships and texture classes. The second layer fuses the spatial and textural net outputs to make the final classifications.

In this paper we propose a new design methodology for synthesizing an optimal VLSI architecture implementing a real-time Distributed Arithmetic-based inner product. Our design methodology considers the design space as bidimensional one. In the first dimension we consider all possible input data parallelisations: from bit-serial to bit-parallel. In the second dimension we consider all possible lookup-table partitioning. Using a new ROM generic model, expressions are developed for area and maximum input data bandwidth, which allows to have an explicit formulation of the area-bandwidth tradeoff. Finally, for a given set of application constraints (inner product size and data bandwidth), we exhibit the optimal architectural parameters that provide the smallest chip area.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

IEEE International Conference on Acoustics; Speech, and Signal Processing, p.v.621-v.624, 1992 and IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems-II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing, vol.30, p.723-733, Oct. 1992). Moreover, we use the memory-based approach to realize the cyclic convolutions by systolic arrays and implement the multiplications by small ROMs and adders. The presented array not only outperforms the distributed arithmetic (DA) architectures in the hardware area, but also owns low input/output (I/O) cost, power dissipation, high computing speeds and flexibility in transform length.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389609","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

Tiche was designed for achieving privacy when fax or speech are transmitted over the public switching telephone network, PSTN. It is composed of three main functional blocks: a speech coder, an encryption algorithm and a digital modem. When Tiche is connected to a telephone set and to the PSTN, the modem tries to communicate at the higher rate possible for the given channel and selects the speech coder according to that, it selects one of the bit rates available with the standard V32 (4800 or 9600 bps). When it transmits fares Tiche detects the communication standard: V27, V29 or V17 and selects the corresponding modem. The ciphering system is based on both public key and private key algorithms. The overall system is digital and was programmed using DSP.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8835","startPage":"II/425","endPage":"II/428 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

The use of simple operations and data movement makes it suitable for VLSI implementation and it can be easily mapped onto fine-grain custom VLSI and FPGA-based architectures. It achieves a factor of two speedup over a previous implementation of the same algorithm by virtue of digit pipelining made possible by the use of signed-digit arithmetic. In addition, the system can be clocked faster since it uses only nearest neighbor connections on a mesh, thus avoiding the signal propagation delays associated with long routing paths. An N-point DWT takes O(Nk) time and requires O(LJk) area, where L is the filter size, J is the number of octaves and k is the precision.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389635","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

The main obstacle for coherent communications in this channel is strong multiple-access interference from cochannel signals, which affects a common narrowband request channel. Throughput and packet delay in this network depends on the capability of the receiver to resolve collisions between request packets. In this paper we propose an adaptive multiuser receiver for joint parameter estimation and multiple-access interference cancellation. It extends previous work on adaptive multiuser detectors to the more realistic communication scenario by estimating signal parameters rather than assuming that they are known. The adaptive approach is different from the one used in a centralized multiuser receiver in that no knowledge of the signature sequences of any of the active users is required.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/389639/","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","accessionNumber":"4917135","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive linear multiuser receiver for deep water acoustic local area networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive linear multiuser receiver for deep water acoustic local area networks","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00389639.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035248S","chronDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3104","citationCount":"7","articleId":"389639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":389662,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

This approach is well suited to enhance lines whatever their shapes and without using any information about signal features (stationarity, duration, number of narrow-band components) and noise level.

The authors present a neuromimetic approach in signal processing. A set of neural networks is used to find the azimuth of one or several sources impinging on a linear array of equally spaced sensors. Each network in this set is specialised to determine if there is an emitter in a given angular sector. Thus a neural network has a specific architecture suited to detect and enhance the signal coming from the angular sector it is associated with. The performances of this method on real underwater signals confirm the encouraging results obtained on simulation tests.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/389665/","accessionNumber":"4917109","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Far field array processing with neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Far field array processing with neural networks","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00389665.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035313S","chronDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3104","citationCount":"3","articleId":"389665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":389667,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Three techniques are investigated that allow delay estimation, namely normalized cross correlation, LMS adaptive filters, crosspower-spectrum phase: they are combined with a bidimensional representation, the coherence measure, in order to emphasize information that can be exploited for estimating position of both non-moving and moving acoustic sources. To compare the given techniques, different acoustic sources were considered, that generated events in different positions in space. Expressing performance in terms of accuracy of the wavefront direction angle, experiments showed that the crosspower-spectrum phase based technique outperforms the other two. This technique provided very promising preliminary results also in terms of source position estimation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

The originality of the hybrid system developed is in combining the probabilities of the modular TDNN architecture with those of CDHMMs during the recognition phase. On three speakers of the DARPA RM speaker-dependent task, we show that these small TDNNs trained on phone ambiguities can improve word recognition performance of state-of-the-art CDHMMs. The TDNN implementation achieved a word error rate reduction of 15%. We discuss strategies for extending this approach from the DARPA RM speaker-dependent database to the larger DARPA RM speaker-independent database.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389693","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

The conditions insuring the validity of this approach are explained and practical results for trigram demonstrate its usefulness.

The algorithms use compensation vectors that are added to the cepstral representations of speech that is input to a speech recognition system. While these vectors are computed from direct frame-by-frame comparisons of cepstra of speech simultaneously recorded in the training environment and various prototype testing environments, the compensation algorithms do not assume that the acoustical characteristics of the actual testing environment are known. The specific compensation vector applied in a given frame depends on either physical attributes such as SNR or presumed phonetic identity. The compensation algorithms are evaluated using the 1992 ARPA 5000 word WSJ/CSR corpus. The best system combines phoneme-based and SNR-based cepstral compensation with cepstral mean normalization, and provides a 66.8% reduction in error rate over baseline processing when tested using a standard suite of unknown microphones.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/389718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4917055","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Environment normalization for robust speech recognition using direct cepstral comparison","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Environment normalization for robust speech recognition using direct cepstral comparison","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00389718.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029219S","chronDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3104","citationCount":"14","articleId":"389718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":389720,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Xie","affiliation":[" ESAT, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"lastName":"Fei Xie","id":"37608119900"},{"name":"D.

Oversampling (OS) (w.r.t. the symbol rate) of the cyclostationary received signal leads to a stationary vector-valued signal (polyphase representation (PR)). OS also leads to a fractionally-spaced channel model and equalizer. In the PR, channel and equalizer can be considered as an analysis and synthesis filter bank. Zero-forcing (ZF) equalization corresponds to a perfect-reconstruction filter bank. We show that in the OS case FIR ZF equalizers exist for a FIR channel. In the PR, the multichannel linear prediction of the noiseless received signal becomes singular eventually, reminiscent of the single-channel prediction of a sum of sinusoids. As a result, the channel can be identified from the received signal second-order statistics by linear prediction in the noise-free case, and by using the Pisarenko method when there is additive noise. In the given data case, MUSIC (subspace) or ML techniques can be applied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389749","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

Multipath problem always exists in the mobile environment, especially for a mobile unit which is often embedded in its surroundings. The RAKE receiver has been used to reduce the multipath fading in a wideband spread spectrum mobile system. However, the tap weights of the multipath channel model need to be estimated. We explore the possibility of using advanced signal processing algorithms to estimate the multipath channels and propose a least-squares approach to tap weight estimation based on chip rate channel estimates to investigate the performance of the RAKE receiver in a realistic mobile environment.

Numerical examples are given to illustrate the usefulness of this approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/389763/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"iv","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4946391","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1994","displayDocTitle":"Broadband maximum energy array with user imposed spatial and frequency constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband maximum energy array with user imposed spatial and frequency constraints","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00389763.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058581S","chronDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3104","citationCount":"17","articleId":"389763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":389765,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.N.

To propagate the involved probability density functions, adequate finite representations are needed. This is accomplished in this work by adopting minimum Kullback (1978) distance criteria. Applied to the important and paradigmatic cyclic phase estimation problem, our approach leads to consistent and systematic design methods. The resulting simple and parallelizable structure outperforms the commonly used extended Kalman-Bucy filter in tracking and acquisition situations. These features make the developed nonlinear filter suited to digital communications (carrier synchronization).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/389765/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","volume":"iv","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4946389","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1994","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear phase estimators based on the Kullback distance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear phase estimators based on the Kullback distance","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00389765.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026061S","chronDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3104","citationCount":"14","articleId":"389765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":389770,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Ming Cho","affiliation":["Microelectronics Technology, Inc., Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chao-Ming Cho","id":"37087391251"},{"name":"P.M.

The simultaneous maximum likelihood estimator of (A,/spl theta/) is derived. The derived estimator is based on a combination of a weighted median filter [Astola and Nuevo, 1992] and a generalized form of the ordinary matched filter [Gustavsson and Borjesson, 1992]. Examples of performance for four different detectors are given for a case of binary detection, when the amplitude A or the signal shape s(/spl middot/,/spl theta/) are varied.

The basic assumption is that the data matrix consists of a sum of 2-D complex sinusoids. Our algebraically coupled matrix pencils (ACMP) algorithm splits the 2-D problem into two related 1-D estimation problems. In each direction the frequencies are estimated using a computationally efficient ESPRIT-like subspace algorithm. A further increase in efficiency is due to the algebraic pairing of the horizontal and vertical estimates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

Members of this class are always positive functionals and satisfy the marginal constraints. Therefore, they can be properly interpreted as distributions. We considered the minimization of cross-entropy measures with respect to different priors or \"a priori\" distributions and the case of no prior or maximum entropy, and concluded with the necessity to introduce new marginal constraints. New mixed in time and frequency constraints are derived based on a \"direction invariance\" criterion on the time-frequency plane that are directly related to the Fractional Fourier Transform. The implications of this new constrains in the positive class are analyzed from an information theoretic perspective. We conclude that the new constraints provide enough information to fully determine the resulting distribution and thus, no \"a priori\" distribution is necessary.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time frequency analysis","Spectrogram","Signal processing","Frequency estimation","Signal resolution","Entropy","Time factors","Fourier transforms","Constraint theory","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-frequency analysis","signal representation","functional equations","maximum entropy methods","statistical analysis","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["positive time-frequency distribution","positive functionals","marginal constraints","cross-entropy measures minimisation","maximum entropy distribution","time-frequency constraints","direction invariance","fractional Fourier transform","information theory","time-frequency representation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389816","startPage":"IV/301","endPage":"IV/304 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

Given an initial position, the desired source signal is first estimated using a classical beamforming unit. It is in a second step, processed by an \"LMS-like\" gradient stochastic estimation procedure of the steering vector, to adaptively track the correct source position. The newly identified source position is projected over the array manifold, then finally transmitted in a feedback loop to the beamforming unit, closing in this way the global algorithm iteration. The simulation results show that robustness is effectively realized without any compromising output SNR loss.

This is particularly useful in situations where the standard ESPRIT algorithm faces severe problems, such as closely spaced sources or short window lengths. The improved subspace estimates form the basis for several algorithms to separate and reconstruct superimposed signals arriving from different directions.

The Baum-Welch (BW) identification algorithm is able to estimate all the parameters of the model, including the constellation and the probability of each symbol. Minor modifications to the algorithm allow one to consider restrictions or known parameters to improve the estimation of the rest of parameters with methods of lower complexity. An LMS-type adaptive version of the BW algorithm is also developed and tested. The simulation results show the fast convergence of the proposed optimal approaches.

However, the conventional beamforming methods are not suitable for such use, since these methods were mainly developed for signal detection and DOA estimation in radar and sonar. In this paper, utilizing the cyclostationarities of communication signals, we propose three blind cyclic adaptive algorithms (CAB's) and associated fast implementation schemes.

However, each time or frequency channel may be reused among several mobiles by means of an antenna array at the base station which points a separate beam at each user. The downlink beamformer would normally operate in an \"open loop\" mode, in which the base steers a mainlobe in the direction of each mobile. Such a system may operate effectively in a free space environment with no multipath. In the presence of scattering, open loop methods will not perform adequately. A new \"closed loop\" technique is presented in which each mobile user feeds back to the base estimates of the received signal amplitudes. Using feedback, the base station can achieve precision beamforming resulting in lower crosstalk and improved signal separation even in the presence of strong scattering environments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389867","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

Since a balance is sought between the small magnitude of the complex approximation error and rapid re-design for employment in variable-delay situations, techniques with closed-form design formulae have been favoured. Size of fractional delay and oddness or evenness of the filter exhibit simple, but fundamentally important interplay, and an irreducible error at the Nyquist frequency always prevails. Guidelines for choosing between these closed-form candidate filters are suggested. The popular sinc delayer is shown to be a particularly poor performer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389950","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

When identifying and compensating such systems by digital processing methods, it has been common practice to see the sampling frequency at the Nyquist rate of the output signal. The aim of this paper is to show that sampling at the Nyquist rate of the output signal is usually not necessary, and that a nonlinear system can be identified and compensated at the Nyquist rate of the input signal. We do this by invoking Zhu's (see IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems-II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing., vol.39, no.8, p.587-588, 1992) generalised sampling theorem, and by giving three examples of nonlinear system identification and compensation. The first two examples involve known nonlinearities, the first memoryless, the second with memory. The third example deals with real data from an unknown nonlinearity in a radio frequency amplifier. For each example, identification and compensation are carried out for two input signal bandwidths, one causing the distortion terms of interest to be aliased, while for the other, they are not. The results show successful identification and compensation in both cases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389977","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

But they can present local minima which do not equalize the channel. For a QAM system, this paper brings two novel ideas which jointly suppress this drawback (i) the complex equalizer is the cascade of a backward innovator, a forward innovator and a complex gain realizing both the power control and the carrier phase tracking; (ii) a novel minimization criterion combines the two criteria of prediction and equalization. This criterion is unimodal and is minimized by the optimum equalizer. It can be minimized adaptively at the same low computational cost as any other Bussgang technique. By implementing the forward innovator second, the latter can be made recursive and if output decisions are fed back in its loop, the structure resumes to a classical feedback equalizer. This method is successful with very severe channels, such as that of Porat and Friedlander (see IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing, vol.39, p.522-526, 1991), where other methods fail.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389985","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

First, although only the Ruritanian mapping is used for input indexing, it requires to perform a series of complicated tests and additions which even outweigh the computational effort of the PFDCT. Second, the additions mentioned above are not carried out in an in-place form. This implies that an auxiliary data array is required to buffer the temporary results generated during the additions. Otherwise, erroneous results will be obtained. We propose an efficient indexing scheme for the computation of the PFDCT. By suitably swapping the data, all the additions can be carried out in an in-place form. Furthermore the number of tests required to perform on the indices of the data is greatly reduced. They are achieved by considering the special properties of the Ruritanian mapping.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389989","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

We will develop an algorithm, called the quick Fourier transform (QFT), that will reduce the number of floating point operations necessary to compute the DFT by a factor of two or four over direct methods or Goertzel's method for prime lengths. Further by applying the idea to the calculation of a DFT of length-2/sup M/, we construct a new O(N log N) algorithm. The algorithm can be easily modified to compute the DFT with only a subset of input points, and it will significantly reduce the number of operations when the data are real. The simple structure of the algorithm and the fact that it is well suited for DFTs on real data should lead to efficient implementations and to a wide range of applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389994","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

Little research work has been reported on the effective way to convert the discrete cosine transform (DCT) into a recursive form and the related realization. We propose a new method to convert a prime length DCT into a recursive structure. A trivial approach is to convert the DCT into the DFT and to apply Goertzel's (1958) algorithm for the rest of the realization. However, this method is inefficient. In our approach, we convert a prime length DCT into suitable transforms with half of the original length to effect fast realization. The number of operations is greatly reduced and the structure is extremely regular.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient formulation for the realization of discrete cosine transform using recursive structure","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.
