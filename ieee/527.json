Web vulnerability scanners allow detecting security vulnerabilities in Web services by stressing the service from the point of view of an attacker. However, research and practice show that different scanners have different performance on vulnerabilities detection. In this paper we present an experimental evaluation of security vulnerabilities in 300 publicly available Web services. Four well known vulnerability scanners have been used to identify security flaws in Web services implementations. A large number of vulnerabilities has been observed, which confirms that many services are deployed without proper security testing. Additionally, the differences in the vulnerabilities detected and the high number of false-positives (35% and 40% in two cases) and low coverage (less than 20% for two of the scanners) observed highlight the limitations of Web vulnerability scanners on detecting security vulnerabilities in Web services.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2009-July 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5270294/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10893594","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5270294/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using web security scanners to detect vulnerabilities in web services","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using web security scanners to detect vulnerabilities in web services","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"79pdsmvieira.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043426S","chronDate":"June 29 2009-July 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5243642","isNumber":"5270274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5243642","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5270274","articleId":"5270294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5270297,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Wang","affiliation":["Reliable Computing Laboratory, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37537359500"},{"name":"Mark G.

The circuit under diagnosis is assumed to be comprised of a large number of field repairable units (FRUs), which can be replaced with spares when they are found to be defective. Since the proposed self-diagnosis circuit is implemented on the chip, responses that are scanned out of scan chains are compressed first by the space compression circuit and then by the time compression circuit to reduce the volume of test response data. Both the space and the time compression circuit implement a Reed-Solomon code. Unlike prior work, in the proposed technique, responses of all FRUs are observed at the same time to reduce diagnosis time. The proposed diagnosis circuit can locate up to l defective FRUs. We propose a novel space-compression circuit that reduces hardware overhead by exploiting the frequency difference of the scan shift clock and the system clock. When the size of constituent multiple-input signature-register (MISR) is m, the total number of signatures to be stored for the fault-free signature is 2lmB bits, where 1 les B les m. The experimental results show that the proposed diagnosis circuit that can locate up to 4 defective FRUs in the same test session can be implemented with less than 1% of hardware overhead for a large industrial design. Hardware overhead for the diagnosis circuit is lower for large CUDs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5270327/","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2009-July 2 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10893624","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5270327/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A self-diagnosis technique using Reed-Solomon codes for self-repairing chips","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A self-diagnosis technique using Reed-Solomon codes for self-repairing chips","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"46dccsseongmoonwang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073766S","chronDate":"June 29 2009-July 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5243642","isNumber":"5270274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5243642","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5270274","articleId":"5270327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5270332,"authors":[{"name":"Zibi Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zibi","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37538781600"},{"name":"Michael R.

Since many anomaly-detection algorithms have been proposed for this task, it is natural to ask which are the top performers (e.g., to identify promising research directions). Unfortunately, we cannot conduct a sound comparison of detectors using the results in the literature because evaluation conditions are inconsistent across studies. Our objective is to collect a keystroke-dynamics data set, to develop a repeatable evaluation procedure, and to measure the performance of a range of detectors so that the results can be compared soundly. We collected data from 51 subjects typing 400 passwords each, and we implemented and evaluated 14 detectors from the keystroke-dynamics and pattern-recognition literature. The three top-performing detectors achieve equal-error rates between 9.6% and 10.2%. The results-along with the shared data and evaluation methodology-constitute a benchmark for comparing detectors and measuring progress.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing anomaly-detection algorithms for keystroke dynamics","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems & Networks","doi":"10.1109/DSN.2009.5270346","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems & Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5243642/5270274/05270346.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSN.2009.5270346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5270274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5270346","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5270346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2009-July 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Comparing anomaly-detection algorithms for keystroke dynamics","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5270346/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10893642","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing anomaly-detection algorithms for keystroke dynamics","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"30dccskillourhymaxion.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077071S","chronDate":"June 29 2009-July 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5243642","isNumber":"5270274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5243642","citationCount":"224","xplore-issue":"5270274","articleId":"5270346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5270347,"authors":[{"name":"Hari Kannan","affiliation":["Computer Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Hari","lastName":"Kannan","id":"37681733700"},{"name":"Michael Dalton","affiliation":["Computer Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Dalton","id":"37565641700"},{"name":"Christos Kozyrakis","affiliation":["Computer Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Kozyrakis","id":"37282352700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4422-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4421-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0889"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-3927"}],"articleNumber":"5270347","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":382},"abstract":"Dynamic information flow tracking (DIFT) is a promising security technique. With hardware support, DIFT prevents a wide range of attacks on vulnerable software with minimal performance impact. DIFT architectures, however, require significant changes in the processor pipeline that increase design and verification complexity and may affect clock frequency. These complications deter hardware vendors from supporting DIFT. This paper makes hardware support for DIFT cost effective by decoupling DIFT functionality onto a simple, separate coprocessor. Decoupling is possible because DIFT operations and regular computation need only synchronize on system calls. The coprocessor is a small hardware engine that performs logical operations and caches 4-bit tags. It introduces no changes to the design or layout of the main processor's logic, pipeline, or caches, and can be combined with various processors. Using a full-system hardware prototype and realistic Linux workloads, we show that the DIFT coprocessor provides the same security guarantees as current DIFT architectures with low runtime overheads.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems & Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5243642/5270274/05270347.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"114","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems & Networks","doi":"10.1109/DSN.2009.5270347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSN.2009.5270347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5270274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5270347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupling Dynamic Information Flow Tracking with a dedicated coprocessor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coprocessors","Hardware","Pipelines","Information security","Software performance","Computer architecture","Clocks","Cost function","Frequency synchronization","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","data flow computing","Linux","pipeline processing","special purpose computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoupling dynamic information flow tracking","dedicated coprocessor","software security technique","hardware support","DIFT architecture","verification complexity","design complexity","clock frequency","hardware vendor","coprocessor","logical operation","processors logic","processors pipeline","processors cache","realistic Linux workload","storage capacity 4 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software security","Semantic Vulnerabilities","Dynamic information flow tracking","Processor architecture","Coprocessors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5270347/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2009-July 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Decoupling Dynamic Information Flow Tracking with a dedicated coprocessor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5270347/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10893643","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupling Dynamic Information Flow Tracking with a dedicated coprocessor","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"28dccskanan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074309S","chronDate":"June 29 2009-July 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5243642","isNumber":"5270274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5243642","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5270274","articleId":"5270347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5270401,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Anyi","affiliation":["Communication and Information Engineering Institute, Xi''an University of Science and Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Anyi","id":"37540442400"},{"name":"Lin Lan","affiliation":["Communication and Information Engineering Institute, Xi''an University of Science and Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Lan","id":"38112302700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4247-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-9613"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-963X"}],"articleNumber":"5270401","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Time division synchronous code division multiple access","Frequency synchronization","Clocks","Global Positioning System","Multiaccess communication","Employee welfare","Business communication","Home computing","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","synchronisation","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["home base station synchronization method","TD-SCDMA system","time synchronization method","UE operating mode","home base station operating mode","open loop synchronization","TD-SCDMA macrostations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["home base station","synchronization","UE operating mode","home base station operating mode component"]}],"abstract":"This paper provides a time synchronization method which is suitable for TD-SCDMA home base stations, based on existing solutions to solve the problem of home base station's time synchronization problem.

We executed the wafer adhesion depending on temperature (130degC, 190degC), the pressure (5000 N, 8000 N), the height of the adhesive layer (10 mum, 20 mum) and the adhesive time (process time, the time for temperature rising) of each of the silicon and glass wafer. The warpage was measured using three-dimensional measuring equipment and the results were caused by the differences of CTE and the physical stress. It was also confirmed that the more the temperature of Si wafer, adhesive pressure and adhesive layer was lowered in order to improve the warpage results, the more warpage decreased, and that the adhesive time and temperature differences of glass wafer were relatively insufficient factors. To judge the degree of wafer adhesion, the shear intensity was tested and it showed that the higher the adhesive temperature of glass wafer was, the more degree of shear intensity it showed, and that the other conditions showed little effects. Also, in the center of the adhesive wafer where the warpage occurred showed that the more it was getting to the edge, the more shear intensity decreased, and that the stress related with the occurrence of warpage also had effects on the state of adhesion.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A warpage of wafer level bonding for CIS (CMOS Image Sensor) device using polymer adhesive","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology & High Density Packaging","doi":"10.1109/ICEPT.2009.5270683","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology & High Density Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/5234372/5270539/05270683.pdf","startPage":"577","endPage":"580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEPT.2009.5270683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5270539","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5270683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5270683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A warpage of wafer level bonding for CIS (CMOS Image Sensor) device using polymer adhesive","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5270683/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893982","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A warpage of wafer level bonding for CIS (CMOS Image Sensor) device using polymer adhesive","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"E301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045919S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234372","isNumber":"5270539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234372","xplore-issue":"5270539","articleId":"5270683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5270721,"authors":[{"name":"Lingzhi Ke","affiliation":["Department of Communication and Information System, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China","Shenzhen Institute of advance technology, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lingzhi","lastName":"Ke","id":"38099088400"},{"name":"Peng Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Communication and Information System, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38102492900"},{"name":"Lei Li","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institute of advance technology, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Li","id":"37067768100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4658-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4659-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5270721","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Voltage","Semiconductor device noise","Circuit noise","Pins","Logic","Communication switching","Frequency","Power semiconductor switches","Power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SSN","FPGA products","simultaneous switching noise","integrated circuit designs","highspeed system designs","decreasing circuit dimensions","logic levels","limitation characteristic behavior"]}],"abstract":"Simultaneous switching noise (SSN) and its behavior have recently become more and more critical in IC and other highspeed system designs [1][2]. This is attributed to ever-increasing speed, frequency, density, and power, as well as decreasing circuit dimensions and logic levels. The difference in a few mill volts may cause the system to fail. Therefore, it is very important to understand the characteristics of the SSN glitch of an active device for correct system level performance. In this paper, some methods to provide a complete picture of limitation characteristic behavior and its relationship to cause scheme, due to SSN, is demonstrated with FPGA system.

Cloud computing vendors would like to reap most of those benefits.It can change this by bringing past experiences and good judgment into play and adapt them to new situation. That is the mark of being a \"professional\" in IT field. Experience, understanding, and thoughtfulness can help the contract people write an effective service level agreement (SLA) that puts its needs in good legal form.

We extend the method joint approximate diagonalization (JAD) for spatial filtering using a maximum likelihood framework. This generic formulation: 1) bridges the gap between the common spatial patterns (CSPs) and blind source separation of nonstationary sources; and 2) leads to a neurophysiologically adapted version of JAD, accounting for the successive activations/deactivations of brain sources during motor imagery (MI) trials. Using dataset 2a of BCI Competition IV (2008) in which nine subjects were involved in a four-class two-session MI-based BCI experiment, a quantitative evaluation of our extension is provided by comparing its performance against JAD and CSP in the case of cross-validation, as well as session-to-session transfer. While JAD, as already proposed in other works, does not prove to be significantly better than classical one-versus-rest CSP, our extension is shown to perform significantly better than CSP for cross-validated and session-to-session performance. The extension of JAD introduced in this paper yields among the best session-to-session transfer results presented so far for this particular dataset; thus, it appears to be of great interest for real-life BCIs.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2032162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2032162","startPage":"469","endPage":"478","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5393902/05272080.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonstationary Brain Source Separation for Multiclass Motor Imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Nonstationary Brain Source Separation for Multiclass Motor Imagery","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","volume":"57","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272080/","accessionNumber":"11071396","pubMedId":"19789106","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272080/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonstationary Brain Source Separation for Multiclass Motor Imagery","sourcePdf":"tbme-gouy-pailler-2032162.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090754S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5393902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5393902","articleId":"5272080","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5272082,"authors":[{"name":"Jirka Roubal","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"bio":{"p":["Jirka Roubal was born in Louny, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic) in 1978.

The battery charger is derived from the power hardware of the scooter, with the ac motor drive that operates as three-phase boost rectifier with power factor correction capability. The control of the charger is also integrated into the scooter control firmware that is implemented on a fixed-point DSP controller. Current-controlled or voltage-controlled charge modes are actuated according to the requirements of the battery management system, that is embedded into the battery pack. With respect to previous integrated chargers, the ac current is absorbed at unitary power factor with no harmonic distortion. Moreover, no additional filtering is needed since the pulsewidth modulation ripple is minimized by means of phase interleaving. The feasibility of the integral charger with different ac motors (induction motor, surface-mounted phase modulation motor) is also discussed, by means of a general model purposely developed for three-phase ac machines. The effectiveness of the proposed battery charger is experimentally demonstrated on a prototype electric scooter, equipped with two Li-ion battery packs rated 260 V, 20 Ah.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2033187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5440038/05272097.pdf","startPage":"751","endPage":"759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2033187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Integral Battery Charger With Power Factor Correction for Electric Scooter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272097/","displayDocTitle":"An Integral Battery Charger With Power Factor Correction for Electric Scooter","volume":"25","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11208358","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272097/","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integral Battery Charger With Power Factor Correction for Electric Scooter","sourcePdf":"tpel-pellegrino-2033187.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072107S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5440038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"5440038","articleId":"5272097","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5272099,"authors":[{"name":"Miroslav Vasic","affiliation":["Centro de Electr\u00f3nica Industrial, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5443664/5272099/5272099-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Miroslav Vasi\u0107 received the M.S. degree from the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia, in 2005, and the Master\u2019s degree in industrial electronics from the University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 2008, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include switching-mode power supplies, RF circuit design, and digital control applied to power electronics."]},"firstName":"Miroslav","lastName":"Vasic","id":"38568948800"},{"name":"Oscar Garcia","affiliation":["Centro de Electr\u00f3nica Industrial, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5443664/5272099/5272099-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Oscar Garc\u00eda (M\u201999) was born in Madrid, Spain, in 1968.

These amplifiers have high linearity, but suffer from low efficiency when the transmitted signal has high peak-to-average power ratio. The Kahn envelope elimination and restoration technique is used to enhance the efficiency of RF transmitters by combining highly efficient, nonlinear RF amplifier (class D or E) with a highly efficient envelope amplifier in order to obtain linear and highly efficient RF amplifier. This paper presents a solution for the envelope amplifier based on a combination of multilevel converter and linear regulator. The proposed solution can reproduce any signal with maximum spectral component of 2 MHz and give instantaneous maximum power of 50 W. The efficiency measurements show that when the signals with low average value are transmitted, it has up to 49% higher efficiency than an ideal linear regulator that is used as a conventional solution. Additionally, the algorithm for the optimization of the voltage levels, for the multilevel converter, is explained as well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11243423","htmlLink":"/document/5272099/","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel Power Supply for High-Efficiency RF Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel Power Supply for High-Efficiency RF Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tpel-vasi-2033186.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076628S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5443664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5443664","articleId":"5272099","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5272111,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The objective of this paper is to propose an algorithm of range-free localization for WSNs using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a rotary directional antenna. This algorithm, denominated as the azimuthally defined area localization algorithm (ADAL), is executed in each sensor node and is based only on the analysis of the information received from the UAV, therefore is energy efficient and contributes to extend the lifetime of the sensor network. Additionally the proposed algorithm has the advantage of being simple and economical. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is a practical, effective and accurate method for sensor nodes location in a WSN.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Networked Digital Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235787/5272056/05272111.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"273","publicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Networked Digital Technologies","doi":"10.1109/NDT.2009.5272111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NDT.2009.5272111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272056","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A range-free localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks based on unmanned aerial vehicles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Directional antennas","Mobile agents","Biomedical monitoring","Condition monitoring","Data acquisition","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Intelligent sensors","Mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directive antennas","radio direction-finding","remotely operated vehicles","telecommunication network reliability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["range-free localization algorithm","wireless sensor network","unmanned aerial vehicle","data acquisition","directional antenna","azimuthally defined area localization algorithm","sensor network lifetime"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Range-free localization","wireless sensor network","unmanned aerial vehicle","directional antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"A range-free localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks based on unmanned aerial vehicles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272111/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10894609","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","conferenceDate":"28-31 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A range-free localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks based on unmanned aerial vehicles","confLoc":"Ostrava, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"497ndt.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049823S","chronDate":"28-31 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235787","isNumber":"5272056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235787","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5272056","articleId":"5272111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5272115,"authors":[{"name":"Simon Schramm","affiliation":["High Power Electronics Laboratory, General Electric Global Research Europe, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5443664/5272115/5272115-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Simon Schramm received the M.Sc. degree from the Munich University of Applied Sciences, Munich, Germany.

The integer and noninteger harmonics generated by line-commutated converters cause pulsating torque harmonics on the motor and on the grid side of the converter. Intersections of harmonic excitation frequencies with torsional natural frequencies of mechanical drive trains (motor-driven load or generator train) cannot always be avoided in the operating-speed range of the motor. Continuously generated harmonic torque excitations could have a critical impact on the torsional behavior of the entire train. It is therefore mandatory to perform torsional analyses during the design stage of large drives, as specified in API 617 [1] to avoid torsional interaction issues. In multiunit plants, more sophisticated analyses have to be performed, considering the fully coupled electrical and mechanical system. The risk for operational problems increases with increasing percentage of converter loads (converter power relative to the short circuit level of the grid). Some oil and gas production sites, e.g., offshore platforms, are based on island or island-like power systems. To mitigate the risk of torsional issues with increasing percentage of converter loads in weak power systems, new devices for damping torsional resonance modes have been developed and successfully tested. The effect of torsional mode damping will be explained by coupled electromechanical simulations and by measurement results from applying an integrated torsional mode damper (TMD) to a 30 MW gas compression train. The TMD does not require changes to the mechanical or electrical system design and can be designed as a retrofit control system extension for variable speed drives from different manufacturers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5272115/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11243424","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Damping Torsional Interharmonic Effects of Large Drives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping Torsional Interharmonic Effects of Large Drives","sourcePdf":"tpel-schramm-2033274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052753S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5443664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5443664","articleId":"5272115","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":5272119,"authors":[{"name":"Guohua Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5440038/5272119/5272119-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guohua Zhou received the B.S. degree in electronic and information engineering and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the School of Electrical Engineering.","His current research interests include analog and digital control techniques, modulation methods of switching-mode power supplies, modeling, simulation, and analysis of dynamical behavior of switching dc\u2013dc converters."]},"firstName":"Guohua","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37533982000"},{"name":"Jianping Xu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5440038/5272119/5272119-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jianping Xu received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Electronics Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 1984 and 1989, respectively.","Since 1989, he has been with the School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, where he has been a Professor, since 1995.

To calculate the average inductor current with minimum calculation time and appropriate precision, a new algorithm, called the four-point-mean (FPM) algorithm, is proposed. The DAC control laws with trailing-edge and leading-edge modulations are derived by using FPM algorithm, and their stabilities are studied. The subharmonic oscillation of DAC controlled switching dc-dc converters is investigated and analyzed. It is shown that both digital slope compensation and digital reposition compensation of the ac component of duty ratio for digitally controlled switching dc-dc converters cannot eliminate the subharmonic oscillation of DAC controlled switching dc-dc converters. Instead, a new method, called digital triangle compensation, for the elimination of the subharmonic oscillation of DAC controlled switching dc-dc converters is proposed and studied.

Current location-management schemes lack scalability and, hence, are proven unable to work in large-scale networks. Therefore, location management in VANETs remains a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a new region-based location-service-management protocol (RLSMP) that uses mobility patterns as means to synthesize node movement and, thus, can be used in large VANET applications. The protocol attempts to relax the scalability issue suffered by other protocols by employing message aggregation in location updating and in querying. Furthermore, due to the protocol's intrinsic locality awareness, it achieves minimum control overhead. To evaluate the efficiency of the protocol, we study its performance analytically and by using simulation for a 2-D random-walk model, as well as on real mobility patterns. The performance of the protocol is compared with that of other prominent location-management protocols.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Region-Based Location-Service-Management Protocol for VANETs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2033079","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5415848/05272140.pdf","startPage":"917","endPage":"931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2033079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415848","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272140","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272140/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Region-Based Location-Service-Management Protocol for VANETs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5272140/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11149576","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Region-Based Location-Service-Management Protocol for VANETs","sourcePdf":"tvt-saleet-2033079.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074638S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5415848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"5415848","articleId":"5272140","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5272172,"authors":[{"name":"Galina Nemova","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Physics, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5290263/5272172/5272172-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Galina Nemova was born in Russia, in 1964.

To overcome the scaling challenge related to miniaturized pixel design rules, far beyond traditional 3-D stacking alignment capabilities, a sequential construction is applied. This paper gives a technical overview of this 3-D scheme and validates a part of its building blocks.

In this paper, a novel compressed sensing (CS) theory is introduced for the surface metrology to reduce data acquisition. We first describe that the CS is naturally fit to surface measurement and analysis. Then, a geometric-wavelet-based recovery algorithm is proposed for scratched and textural surfaces by solving a convex optimal problem with sparse constrained by curvelet transform and wave atom transform. In the framework of compressed measurement, one can stably recover compressible surfaces from incomplete and inaccurate random measurements by using the recovery algorithm. The necessary number of measurements is far fewer than those required by traditional methods that have to obey the Shannon sampling theorem. The compressed metrology essentially shifts online measurement cost to computational cost of offline nonlinear recovery. By combining the idea of sampling, sparsity, and compression, the proposed method indicates a new acquisition protocol and leads to building new measurement instruments. It is very significant for measurements limited by physical constraints, or is extremely expensive. Experiments on engineering and bioengineering surfaces demonstrate good performances of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5463259/05272200.pdf","startPage":"1600","endPage":"1615","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2027744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2027744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463259","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Sensing for Surface Characterization and Metrology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Metrology","Surface fitting","Sampling methods","Computational efficiency","Data acquisition","Surface waves","Surface texture","Atomic measurements","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curvelet transforms","data acquisition","information theory","measurement errors","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","surface characterization","surface metrology","convex optimal problem","curvelet transform","wave atom transform","Shannon sampling theorem","sparse recovery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing (CS)/compressive sampling","curvelets","incomplete measurement","sparse recovery","surface characterization","surface metrology","wave atoms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Sensing for Surface Characterization and Metrology","volume":"59","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5272200/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11285863","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Sensing for Surface Characterization and Metrology","sourcePdf":"tim-ma-2027744.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084904S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5463259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5463259","articleId":"5272200","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5272205,"authors":[{"name":"Jingbo Zhu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Medical Image Computing, Ministry of Education, and the Natural Language Processing Laboratory, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"p":["Jingbo Zhu (M'09) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1999.","He has been with the Institute of Computer Software and Theory, Northeastern University, since 1999.

An important element in the development of a WBAN is the characterization of the physical layer of the network, including an estimation of the delay spread and the path loss between two nodes on the body. This paper discusses the propagation channel between two half-wavelength dipoles at 2.45 GHz, placed near a human body and presents an application for cross-layer design in order to optimize the energy consumption of different topologies. Propagation measurements are performed on real humans in a multipath environment, considering different parts of the body separately. In addition, path loss has been numerically investigated with an anatomically correct model of the human body in free space using a 3-D electromagnetic solver. Path loss parameters and time-domain channel characteristics are extracted from the measurement and simulation data. A semi-empirical path loss model is presented for an antenna height above the body of 5 mm and antenna separations from 5 cm up to 40 cm. A time-domain analysis is performed and models are presented for the mean excess delay and the delay spread. As a cross-layer application, the proposed path loss models are used to evaluate the energy efficiency of single-hop and multihop network topologies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272227/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","volume":"13","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10957706","pubMedId":"19789118","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272227/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of On-Body Communication Channel and Energy Efficient Topology Design for Wireless Body Area Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of On-Body Communication Channel and Energy Efficient Topology Design for Wireless Body Area Networks","sourcePdf":"titb-joseph-2033054.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103281S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5300653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"220","xplore-issue":"5300653","articleId":"5272227","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5272236,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The idea to morphologically decompose a signal into its building blocks is an important problem in signal processing and has far-reaching applications in science and technology. Starck , proposed a novel decomposition method-morphological component analysis (MCA)-based on sparse representation of signals. MCA assumes that each (monochannel) signal is the linear mixture of several layers, the so-called morphological components, that are morphologically distinct, e.g., sines and bumps. The success of this method relies on two tenets: sparsity and morphological diversity. That is, each morphological component is sparsely represented in a specific transform domain, and the latter is highly inefficient in representing the other content in the mixture. Once such transforms are identified, MCA is an iterative thresholding algorithm that is capable of decoupling the signal content. Sparsity and morphological diversity have also been used as a novel and effective source of diversity for blind source separation (BSS), hence extending the MCA to multichannel data. Building on these ingredients, we will provide an overview the generalized MCA introduced by the authors in and as a fast and efficient BSS method. We will illustrate the application of these algorithms on several real examples. We conclude our tour by briefly describing our software toolboxes made available for download on the Internet for sparse signal and image decomposition and separation.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2009.2024776","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5466592/05272236.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2009.2024776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5466592","startPage":"983","endPage":"994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Decomposition and Separation Using Sparse Representations: An Overview","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272236","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image Decomposition and Separation Using Sparse Representations: An Overview","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272236/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"98","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11304851","dateOfInsertion":"18 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5272236/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Decomposition and Separation Using Sparse Representations: An Overview","sourcePdf":"jproc-fadili-2024776.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117831S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5466592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"5466592","articleId":"5272236","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5272246,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Methods compensating for the high probability of bit errors accompanying wireless transmissions are, however, needed. This is predominantly important in industrial applications with strict reliability and timing requirements, which cannot be met by standard communication protocols as, e.g., TCP. In this paper, a way of combining retransmissions with real-time worst-case scheduling analysis is presented that can offer both a high grade of reliability and hard real-time support. The presented solution handles one or several retransmission attempts of erroneous data without jeopardizing already guaranteed delay bounds of other packets. A real-time analysis for a full-duplex, asymmetric link, utilizing the novel retransmission scheme and supporting both piggybacked and nonpiggybacked acknowledgments, is provided. A simulation study is presented that evaluates the performance of the retransmission scheme for bit-error rates typically experienced in wireless communication. The results clearly indicate a possible reduction of the message error rate by several orders of magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2009.2031921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5289971","startPage":"429","endPage":"442","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/5289971/05272248.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2009.2031921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Reliable Wireless Industrial Communication With Real-Time Guarantees","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Communication industry","Couplings","Communication cables","Costs","Automation","Timing","Communication standards","Protocols","Job shop scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","probability","radiocommunication","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliable wireless industrial communication","real-time guaranty","automation industry","probability","bit-error rate","real-time worst-case scheduling analysis","hard real-time support","erroneous data retransmission","guaranteed delay bound","piggybacked acknowledgment","nonpiggybacked acknowledgment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication system reliability","data communication","industrial control","protocols","real-time systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Towards Reliable Wireless Industrial Communication With Real-Time Guarantees","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272248/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5272248/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10957804","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Reliable Wireless Industrial Communication With Real-Time Guarantees","sourcePdf":"tii-mjonsson-2031921.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09002S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"5289971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5289971","articleId":"5272248","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5272249,"authors":[{"name":"Muhittin Yilmaz","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Texas A and M University, Kingsville, TX, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Muhittin Yilmaz received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey, in 1992, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Pennsylvania State University, University Park, in 1996 and 2005, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Texas A&M University\u2013Kingsville.

A prototype IP-aware SeReCon demonstrator, implemented on Virtex-5 and supporting reconfiguration of a PCIe accelerator with cryptographic IP cores is described.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IP protection in Partially Reconfigurable FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272250","startPage":"403","endPage":"409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272250.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272250/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"IP protection in Partially Reconfigurable FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272250/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893739","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IP protection in Partially Reconfigurable FPGAs","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"W1C3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078533S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5272255,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A novel averaging and postprocessing scheme is employed to accurately determine the faster of two similar-frequency ring oscillators in the presence of noise. Using this scheme, the average number of unstable bits i.e. bits which can change in value between readings, measured on an FPGA is shown to be reduced from 5.3% to 0.9% at 20degC. Within the range 20-60degC, the percentage of unstable bits is within 2.8%.

Many applications of such devices are mission critical and require the use of cryptographic algorithms to provide the desired security. However, differential power analysis (DPA) attacks pose a sever threat against otherwise secure cryptographic implementations. Current techniques to defend against DPA attacks such as dynamic differential logic (DDL) lead to an increase in area consumption of factor five or more. In this paper we show that moderate security against DPA attacks can be achieved for FPGAs using DDL resulting in an area increase of not much more than a factor two over standard FPGA implementations. Our design flow requires only FPGA design tools and some scripts.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Field programmable gate arrays","Logic","Routing","Batteries","Security","Energy consumption","Application specific integrated circuits","Switches","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DPA resistance","cryptographic algorithm","FPGA","field programmable gate array","battery powered device","differential power analysis","dynamic differential logic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272260","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272260","startPage":"385","endPage":"390","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272260.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272260/","displayDocTitle":"DPA resistance for light-weight implementations of cryptographic algorithms on FPGAs","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10893744","htmlLink":"/document/5272260/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DPA resistance for light-weight implementations of cryptographic algorithms on FPGAs","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"W1B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12294S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5272262,"authors":[{"name":"Sang Kyun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sang Kyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37984792400"},{"name":"Lawrence C.

However, future research in applications of DBNs is hampered by the considerable computation that training requires. In this paper, we describe a novel architecture and FPGA implementation that accelerates the training of general RBMs in a scalable manner, with the goal of producing a system that machine learning researchers can use to investigate ever-larger networks. Our design uses a highly efficient, fully-pipelined architecture based on 16-bit arithmetic for performing RBM training on an FPGA. We show that only 16-bit arithmetic precision is necessary, and we consequently use embedded hardware multiply-and-add (MADD) units. We present performance results to show that a speedup of 25-30X can be achieved over an optimized software implementation on a high-end CPU.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272262","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272262.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A highly scalable Restricted Boltzmann Machine FPGA implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272262/","displayDocTitle":"A highly scalable Restricted Boltzmann Machine FPGA implementation","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272262/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893745","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A highly scalable Restricted Boltzmann Machine FPGA implementation","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"W1A3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049176S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5272264,"authors":[{"name":"Tomasz Kryjak","affiliation":["Department of Automatics, AGH University of Science and Technology, Cracow, Poland"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kryjak","id":"38111090500"},{"name":"Marek Gorgon","affiliation":["Department of Automatics, AGH University of Science and Technology, Cracow, Poland"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Gorgon","id":"37266906500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272264","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup","Cryptography","Circuits","Delay","Data processing","Hardware","Logic","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","parallel machines","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipeline implementation","block cipher CLEFIA","FPGA","encryption","data processing path","supercomputer-compatible hardware accelerator","word length 128 bit"]}],"abstract":"The article presents a pipeline implementation of the block cipher CLEFIA.

When adaptive modulation is not adopted, although brute-force search can be used to find the optimal sensing-order setting of the two users, it has huge computational complexity. Accordingly, we propose two suboptimal algorithms, namely, the greedy search algorithm and the incremental algorithm, which have comparable performance with that of brute-force search and have much less computational complexity. It is shown that, with a high probability, either suboptimal algorithm can reach an optimal point if a backoff mechanism is used for contention resolution. When adaptive modulation is adopted, it is observed that the traditional stopping rule does not lead to an optimal point in the two-user case. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the adoption of adaptive modulation affects the optimal sensing-order setting of the two users, compared with the case without adaptive modulation. These findings imply that the stopping rule and the sensing-order setting should be jointly designed from a systematic point of view.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2027712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05272267.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2027712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","startPage":"4997","endPage":"5008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Sensing-Order Setting in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Two-User Case","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel Sensing-Order Setting in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Two-User Case","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272267/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966619","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5272267/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Sensing-Order Setting in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Two-User Case","sourcePdf":"tvt-jiang-2027712.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118821S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5272267","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5272270,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Schumacher","affiliation":["Paderborn Center of Parallel Computing, University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Schumacher","id":"38099391700"},{"name":"Christian Plessl","affiliation":["Paderborn Center of Parallel Computing, University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Plessl","id":"37542909400"},{"name":"Marco Platzner","affiliation":["Paderborn Center of Parallel Computing, University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Platzner","id":"37265525900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272270","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nearest neighbor searches","Field programmable gate arrays","High performance computing","Master-slave","Computerized monitoring","Frequency estimation","Predictive models","Parallel processing","Concurrent computing","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit interconnections","logic design","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["k-th nearest neighbor thinning","IMORC infrastructure","FPGA accelerator design","XD1000 reconfigurable computing system","architectural template","versatile on-chip interconnect","Opteron","asynchronous FIFO","bitwidth conversion","core-level parallelism","memory mappings","data-dependent behavior","performance optimizations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272270","abstract":"The creation and optimization of FPGA accelerators comprising several compute cores and memories are challenging tasks in high performance reconfigurable computing.

Given the intense competition from multicore and GPUs, there has been a question whether MD on HPRC can be competitive. We concentrate here on the MD kernel computation: determining the short-range force between particle pairs. In particular, we present the first FPGA study on the filtering of particle pairs with nearly zero mutual force, a standard optimization in MD codes. There are several innovations, including a novel partitioning of the particle space, and new methods for filtering and mapping work onto the pipelines. As a consequence, highly efficient filtering can be implemented with only a small fraction of the FPGA's resources. Overall, we find that, for an Altera Stratix-III EP3ES260, 8 force pipelines running at 200MHz can fit on the FPGA, and that they can perform at 95% efficiency. This results in a 80-fold per core speed-up for the short-range force, which is likely to make FPGAs highly competitive for MD.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272272.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"352","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient particle-pair filtering for acceleration of molecular dynamics simulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering","Acceleration","Field programmable gate arrays","Computational modeling","Pipelines","High performance computing","Multicore processing","Kernel","Code standards","Technological innovation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemistry computing","field programmable gate arrays","molecular dynamics method","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle-pair filtering","molecular dynamics simulation","high performance reconfigurable computing","FPGA","Altera Stratix-III EP3ES260"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272272/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient particle-pair filtering for acceleration of molecular dynamics simulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272272/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893688","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient particle-pair filtering for acceleration of molecular dynamics simulation","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"T3C3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064139S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5272274,"authors":[{"name":"Slavissa Jovanovic","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'instrumentation \u00e9lectronique de Nancy-LIEN, Universit\u00e9 Henri Poincar\u00e9, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Slavissa","lastName":"Jovanovic","id":"38189552400"},{"name":"Camel Tanougast","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'instrumentation \u00e9lectronique de Nancy-LIEN, Universit\u00e9 Henri Poincar\u00e9, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Camel","lastName":"Tanougast","id":"37277816500"},{"name":"Serge Weber","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'instrumentation \u00e9lectronique de Nancy-LIEN, Universit\u00e9 Henri Poincar\u00e9, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Serge","lastName":"Weber","id":"37277804200"},{"name":"Christophe Bobda","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Informatik, Universit\u00e4t Postdam, Potsdam, Germany"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Bobda","id":"37265199400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272274","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":827},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System recovery","Fault tolerance","Routing","Network-on-a-chip","Network topology","Runtime","Adaptive systems","Digital signal processing chips","Scalability","Multicore processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","mesh generation","network routing","network-on-chip","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deadlock-free fault-tolerant adaptive routing algorithm","2D mesh NoC interconnection","XY algorithm","reconfigurable system","network topology","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network-on-chip (NoCs)","Fault - tolerance","Reconfigurable systems","Adaptive - Routing","Wormhole - Routing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a new deadlock-free fault-tolerant adaptive routing algorithm for the 2D mesh NoC interconnections.

Our research has shown that frequency of swallowing may serve as a predictor for detecting food intake, differentiating liquids and solids, and estimating ingested mass. This paper proposes and compares two methods of acoustical swallowing detection from sounds contaminated by motion artifacts, speech, and external noise. Methods based on mel-scale Fourier spectrum, wavelet packets, and support vector machines are studied considering the effects of epoch size, level of decomposition, and lagging on classification accuracy. The methodology was tested on a large dataset (64.5 h with a total of 9966 swallows) collected from 20 human subjects with various degrees of adiposity. Average weighted epoch-recognition accuracy for intravisit individual models was 96.8%, which resulted in 84.7% average weighted accuracy in detection of swallowing events. These results suggest high efficiency of the proposed methodology in separation of swallowing sounds from artifacts that originate from respiration, intrinsic speech, head movements, food ingestion, and ambient noise. The recognition accuracy was not related to body mass index, suggesting that the methodology is suitable for obese individuals.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2033037","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5419290/05272275.pdf","startPage":"626","endPage":"633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2033037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Detection of Swallowing Events by Acoustical Means for Applications of Monitoring of Ingestive Behavior","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272275/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Detection of Swallowing Events by Acoustical Means for Applications of Monitoring of Ingestive Behavior","volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11138828","pubMedId":"19789095","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272275/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Detection of Swallowing Events by Acoustical Means for Applications of Monitoring of Ingestive Behavior","sourcePdf":"tbme-sazonov-2033037.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093765S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5419290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"5419290","articleId":"5272275","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":5272276,"authors":[{"name":"Toyokazu Takagi","affiliation":["Systems and Information Engineering, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Toyokazu","lastName":"Takagi","id":"38104982200"},{"name":"Tsutomu Maruyama","affiliation":["Systems and Information Engineering, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsutomu","lastName":"Maruyama","id":"37291753000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272276","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Hidden Markov models","Field programmable gate arrays","Databases","Viterbi algorithm","Feedback","Software tools","Dynamic programming","Heuristic algorithms","Protein sequence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","field programmable gate arrays","hidden Markov models","quadratic programming","software tools"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HMMER search","FPGA","hidden Markov model","field programmable gate arrays","software tool","Viterbi algorithm","quadratic dynamic programming algorithm","protein sequence","feedback path","profile HMM","quadratic search space","memory banks"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes an implementation of HMMER with FPGA. HMMER is one of the most used software tools for sensitive profile HMM (Hidden Markov Model) searches of biological sequence databases. HMMER is a very CPU-intensive program. In HMMER, the Viterbi algorithm, which is a quadratic dynamic programming algorithm, is used to align a profile HMM and a protein sequence. In the profile HMM, a feedback path from the end of the model to the beginning is allowed, and this loop makes it difficult to process the Viterbi algorithm in parallel. In our approach, the alignment is calculated speculatively in parallel, and when the feedback path is selected in the alignment, the alignment is recalculated from the beginning using the fedback score. According to our experiments, the ratio that the feedback path is selected is very low, and the performance loss by the recalculation is less than a few percent. Another problem for accelerating HMMER using FPGA is the large size of the score tables required for profile HMMs. By crossing the search direction in the quadratic search space and the moving direction of each processing unit in the search space, we can minimize the size of the memory banks for storing the score tables. This optimization technique makes it possible to process all profile HMMs in a database efficiently.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating HMMER search using FPGA","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272276","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272276.pdf","startPage":"332","endPage":"337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating HMMER search using FPGA","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272276/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893690","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating HMMER search using FPGA","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"T3C1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054996S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5272278,"authors":[{"name":"Rizwan Syed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Rizwan","lastName":"Syed","id":"38101986400"},{"name":"Xiaolei Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiaolei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37654869700"},{"name":"Yajun Ha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yajun","lastName":"Ha","id":"37391682500"},{"name":"Bharadwaj Veeravalli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bharadwaj","lastName":"Veeravalli","id":"37274109000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272278","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Design methodology","Tiles","Asynchronous communication","Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Logic","Network-on-a-chip","Streaming media","Emulation","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["globally asynchronous and locally synchronous paradigm","FPGA architecture","logic resources","asynchronous communications","serial network-on-chip","JPEG baseline encoder","frequency 224 MHz"]}],"abstract":"The interconnection networks used by current fine grain FPGAs are not scalable for very big array sizes.

Although most audio signal processing operations are straightforward to implement with modern computers, real-time digital simulation of vacuum tubes poses a significant challenge due to the dynamic nonlinearities of the tube circuits. Most of the current vacuum-tube emulators model the unidirectional signal path of the circuit using linear filters and nonlinear waveshapers, possibly with signal-dependent parameters. This paper introduces a physical model of a tube stage circuit using wave digital filters. In contrast to previous unidirectional signal models, the wave digital model implements bidirectional signal propagation. This allows realistic simulation of interesting dynamical nonlinearities, such as the bias variation under reactive load.

Traditional FPGA design methodology using HDLs is no longer sufficient and new methodologies are being sought. An attractive possibility is to use streaming languages. Streaming languages group data into streams, which are processed by computational nodes called kernels. They are suitable for implementation in FPGAs because they expose parallelism, which can be exploited by implementing the application in FPGA logic. Designers can express their designs in a streaming language and target FPGAs without needing a detailed understanding of digital logic design. In this paper we show how the Brook streaming language can be used to simplify design for FPGAs, while providing reasonable performance compared to other methodologies. We show that throughput of streaming applications can be increased through automatic kernel replication. Using our compiler, the FPGA designer can trade off FPGA area and performance by changing the amount of kernel replication. We describe the details of our compiler and present performance and area of a set of benchmarks. We found that throughput scales well with increased replication for most applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancements to FPGA design methodology using streaming","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272286","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272286.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272286/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Enhancements to FPGA design methodology using streaming","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272286/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893696","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancements to FPGA design methodology using streaming","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"T3A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059058S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5272287,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Sotiropoulos","affiliation":["Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Sotiropoulos","id":"38111067900"},{"name":"Ioannis Papaefstathiou","affiliation":["ECE Department, Technical University of Crete, Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Papaefstathiou","id":"37269342000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272287","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":341},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Signal processing algorithms","Acceleration","Databases","Algorithm design and analysis","Field programmable gate arrays","Digital signal processing","Statistical analysis","Principal component analysis","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","face recognition","field programmable gate arrays","fixed point arithmetic","matrix multiplication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel blocked matrix multiplication reconfigurable unit","face recognition system","computational intensive function","DSP","digital signal processing unit","state-of-the-art FPGA device","fixed-point 32-bit number","fixed-point matrix multiplication","CPU intensive part","face identification scheme","fixed-point arithmetic"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present a reconfigurable device which significantly improves the execution time of the most computational intensive functions of three of the most widely used face recognition algorithms; those tasks multiply very large dense matrices.

Signal Process.</i>\n, vol. 58, no. 2, pp. 720-734, Feb. 2010), we characterized the optimal resource allocation in terms of power control and subcarrier assignment, for a downlink sectorized OFDMA system impaired by multicell interference. In our model, the network is assumed to be one dimensional (linear) for the sake of analysis. We also assume that a certain part of the available bandwidth is likely to be reused by different base stations while that the other part of the bandwidth is shared in an orthogonal way between these base stations. The optimal resource allocation characterized in Part I is obtained by minimizing the total power spent by the network under the constraint that all users' rate requirements are satisfied. It is worth noting that when optimal resource allocation is used, any user receives data either in the reused bandwidth or in the protected bandwidth, but not in both (except for at most one pivot-user in each cell). We also proposed an algorithm that determines the optimal values of users' resource allocation parameters. As a matter of fact, the optimal allocation algorithm proposed in Part I requires a large number of operations. In the present paper, we propose a distributed practical resource allocation algorithm with low complexity. We study the asymptotic behavior of both this simplified resource allocation algorithm and the optimal resource allocation algorithm of Part I as the number of users in each cell tends to infinity. Our analysis allows to prove that the proposed simplified algorithm is asymptotically optimal, i.e., it achieves the same asymptotic transmit power as the optimal algorithm as the number of users in each cell tends to infinity. As a byproduct of our analysis, we characterize the optimal value of the frequency reuse factor. Simulations sustain our claims and show that substantial performance improvements are obtained when the optimal value of the frequency reuse factor is used.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Downlink Cellular OFDMA Systems\u2014Part II: Practical Algorithms and Optimal Reuse Factor","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2033307","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5379139/05272289.pdf","startPage":"735","endPage":"749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2033307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272289/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Downlink Cellular OFDMA Systems\u2014Part II: Practical Algorithms and Optimal Reuse Factor","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5272289/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054882","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Downlink Cellular OFDMA Systems\u2014Part II: Practical Algorithms and Optimal Reuse Factor","sourcePdf":"tsp-ksairi-2033307.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.329508S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5379139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5379139","articleId":"5272289","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5272290,"authors":[{"name":"Bita Nezamfar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Bita","lastName":"Nezamfar","id":"37562934300"},{"name":"Mark Horowitz","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Horowitz","id":"37270364000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272290","dbTime":"36 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Integrated circuit interconnections","Threshold voltage","Power system interconnection","Tunable circuits and devices","Fabrication","Energy consumption","Costs","Application specific integrated circuits","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit interconnections","logic design","low-power electronics","microprocessor chips","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-performance tunable FPGA architecture","energy-performance tunable circuit","chip power efficiency","tunable interconnect architecture","pseudo-static interconnect","static interconnect","pulse-mode interconnect","power consumption","pulse-mode lookup table","field-adjustable FPGA architecture","chip fabrication"]}],"abstract":"Energy-performance tunable circuits enable the user to adjust the energy and performance of a chip after fabrication to suite the particular application, thus increase the overall power efficiency of the chip.

Zero-forcing (ZF) is assumed. Considered first is the minimization of transmitted power, for a given total bit rate and a specified set of error probabilities for the symbol streams. The precoder and DFE matrices are optimized jointly with bit allocation. It is shown that the generalized triangular decomposition (GTD) introduced by Jiang, Li, and Hager offers an optimal family of solutions. The optimal linear transceiver (which has a linear equalizer rather than a DFE) with optimal bit allocation is a member of this family. This shows formally that, under optimal bit allocation, linear and DFE transceivers achieve the same minimum power. The DFE transceiver using the geometric mean decomposition (GMD) is another member of this optimal family, and is such that optimal bit allocation yields identical bits for all symbol streams-no bit allocation is necessary-when the specified error probabilities are identical for all streams. The QR-based system used in VBLAST is yet another member of the optimal family and is particularly well-suited when limited feedback is allowed from receiver to transmitter. Two other optimization problems are then considered: (a) minimization of power for specified set of bit rates and error probabilities (the QoS problem), and (b) maximization of bit rate for fixed set of error probabilities and power. It is shown in both cases that the GTD yields an optimal family of solutions.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2033311","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410627/05272297.pdf","startPage":"1334","endPage":"1346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2033311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Transceivers With Decision Feedback and Bit Loading: Theory and Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272297/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Transceivers With Decision Feedback and Bit Loading: Theory and Optimization","volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11105879","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272297/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Transceivers With Decision Feedback and Bit Loading: Theory and Optimization","sourcePdf":"58tsp02-cweng-2033311.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103424S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5410627","articleId":"5272297","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5272298,"authors":[{"name":"Alastair M.

The carry chains bypass the general routing network and are embedded in the logic blocks of FPGAs for fast addition. Conventional intuition is that such carry chains can be used only for implementing carry-propagate addition; state-of-the-art FPGA synthesizers can only exploit the carry chains for these specific circuits. This paper demonstrates that the carry chains can be used to build compressor trees, i.e., multi-input addition circuits used for parallel accumulation and partial product reduction for parallel multipliers implemented in FPGA logic. The key to our technique is to program the lookup tables (LUTs) in the logic blocks to stop the propagation of carry bits along the carry chain at appropriate points. This approach improves the area of compressor trees significantly compared to previous methods that synthesized compressor trees solely on LUTs, without compromising the performance gain over trees built from ternary carry-propagate adders.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893704","htmlLink":"/document/5272301/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting fast carry-chains of FPGAs for designing compressor trees","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting fast carry-chains of FPGAs for designing compressor trees","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"T2A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047857S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5272304,"authors":[{"name":"Iouliia Skliarova","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics / IEETA, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Iouliia","lastName":"Skliarova","id":"37284663400"},{"name":"Valery Sklyarov","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics / IEETA, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Valery","lastName":"Sklyarov","id":"37371704800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272304","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":302},"abstract":"Reconfigurable systems are widely used nowadays to increase performance of computationally intensive applications.

To implement a huge logic circuit in a multi-FPGA system, the circuit needs to be partitioned into multiple FPGAs. Because of the limited interconnection resources between FPGAs, time-multiplexed I/Os are used for inter-FPGA connections. Due to the large delay of time-multiplexed I/Os, inter-FPGA connections strongly affect the system performance. In this paper, we extend an ILP-based optimization method of the inter-FPGA connections to improve the system performance. Our method uses both a normal I/O and a time-multiplexed I/O, and decides whether each inter-FPGA signal is transferred by a time-multiplexed I/O or not. Our extended method improves the system performance considering the variation of the amount of interconnection resources, and the variation of the number of inter-FPGA signals, from an FPGA pair to another FPGA pair. Experiments showed that our method improved the circuit performance on a 4-FPGA system by 26.4% compared with a conventional method, on average.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272309","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272309.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","startPage":"212","endPage":"217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Globally optimal time-multiplexing in inter-FPGA connections for accelerating multi-FPGA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Globally optimal time-multiplexing in inter-FPGA connections for accelerating multi-FPGA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272309/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893749","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5272309/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Globally optimal time-multiplexing in inter-FPGA connections for accelerating multi-FPGA systems","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"T1B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072652S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5272311,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Ehliar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Ehliar","id":"37282015400"},{"name":"Dake Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Dake","lastName":"Liu","id":"37277011300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272311","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","Field programmable gate arrays","Design optimization","Costs","Guidelines","Area measurement","Table lookup","Design engineering","Hardware design languages","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA optimizations","field programmable gate array","standard cell based ASIC","application specific integrated circuits","design components","IP cores"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we discuss how various design components perform in both FPGAs and standard cell based ASICs.

TMR has been successfully applied in FPGAs to mitigate transient faults, which are likely to occur in harsh environments such as in space applications. In addition, fault tolerance techniques gain importance as feature sizes shrink and make circuits less reliable. However, TMR comes at high area penalty, which increases as the TMR grain becomes finer. We propose a slight modification to existing SRAM based FPGA architectures to support fine grain redundancy at an area cost even less than 3times (1.76times in average for our benchmark circuits). Our approach also provides accurate fault location and allows smaller and more infrequent reconfigurations saving both reconfiguration time and power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893754","htmlLink":"/document/5272319/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel SRAM-based FPGA architecture for efficient TMR fault tolerance support","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel SRAM-based FPGA architecture for efficient TMR fault tolerance support","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"T1A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052906S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5272321,"authors":[{"name":"Niccolo Battezzati","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino"],"firstName":"Niccolo","lastName":"Battezzati","id":"37393983400"},{"name":"Filomena Decuzzi","affiliation":["Politechnico di Torino, Italy","Politecnico di Torino"],"firstName":"Filomena","lastName":"Decuzzi","id":"37598361700"},{"name":"Luca Sterpone","affiliation":["Politechnico di Torino, Italy","Politecnico di Torino"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Sterpone","id":"37283245100"},{"name":"Massimo Violante","affiliation":["Politechnico di Torino, Italy","Politecnico di Torino"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Violante","id":"37275742500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272321","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Circuit testing","Costs","Single event transient","Programmable logic arrays","Software testing","Software tools","Ionizing radiation","Logic devices","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","flash memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft errors","flash-based FPGA","benchmark design sensitiveness estimation","single event upsets","hardening techniques","radiation test","prediction analysis"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents the development of three different analysis methodologies in order to evaluate soft errors effects in flash-based FPGAs.

In particular, we are going to upgrade the experimental setup in order to support higher frequencies (up to 250 MHz) for further characterizing SEE effects.

The design of the proposed DPWM architecture is based on fully utilizing the digital clock manager (DCM) resources available on new FPGA boards. Furthermore, this architecture will also window-mask the DCM operation to only a portion of the switching period in order to decrease power dissipation. This proposed digital modulator technique allows for higher DPWM resolution with lower power consumption, the primary barrier to high switching frequency operation. The presented technique relies on power-optimized resources already existing on new FPGAs, and benefits from the inherit phase-shifting properties of the DCM blocks, which help in simplifying the duty cycle generation. The architecture can be applied to achieve different numbers of bits for the DPWM resolution designed for different dc-dc applications. The suggested architecture is first simulated, implemented, and experimentally verified on a Virtex-4 FPGA board.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2033066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2033066","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5338051/05272328.pdf","startPage":"2649","endPage":"2660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338051","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272328/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Window-Masked Segmented Digital Clock Manager-FPGA-Based Digital Pulsewidth Modulator Technique","volume":"24","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11068986","htmlLink":"/document/5272328/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Window-Masked Segmented Digital Clock Manager-FPGA-Based Digital Pulsewidth Modulator Technique","sourcePdf":"tpel-batarseh-2033066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09384S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5338051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5338051","articleId":"5272328","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5272335,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The transition point between phase-shift switching method and the proposed method is investigated and confirmed by experimental results. A field-programmable-gate-array-based digital-controlled experimental system has been set up. The specifications of the converter include: input voltage = 400 V, output voltage = 12 V, and output power = 400 W. Experimental results show that the efficiency improvement can be up to 26% under light-load condition and the standby power is less than 1 W. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed switching control technique.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2033069","startPage":"1001","endPage":"1012","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5443664/05272336.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2033069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switching Control Technique of Phase-Shift-Controlled Full-Bridge Converter to Improve Efficiency Under Light-Load and Standby Conditions Without Additional Auxiliary Components","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting control","Switching converters","MOSFET circuits","Inductors","Pulse width modulation converters","Pulse width modulation","Diodes","Resonance","Inductance","Immune system"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital control","field programmable gate arrays","power convertors","pulse width modulation","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switching control technique","phase-shift-controlled full-bridge converter","light-load conditions","standby conditions","pulsewidth-modulated switching","field-programmable-gate-array","digital-controlled experimental system","voltage 400 V","power 400 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Full-bridge converter","phase-shift full-bridge converter","pulsewidth modulation (PWM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272336/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Switching Control Technique of Phase-Shift-Controlled Full-Bridge Converter to Improve Efficiency Under Light-Load and Standby Conditions Without Additional Auxiliary Components","volume":"25","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5272336/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11229057","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switching Control Technique of Phase-Shift-Controlled Full-Bridge Converter to Improve Efficiency Under Light-Load and Standby Conditions Without Additional Auxiliary Components","sourcePdf":"tpel-lai-2033069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070246S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5443664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"5443664","articleId":"5272336","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5272339,"authors":[{"name":"Brendan Glackin","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Research Centre, University of Ulster, Londonderr, UK"],"firstName":"Brendan","lastName":"Glackin","id":"37681393100"},{"name":"Jim Harkin","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Research Centre, University of Ulster, Londonderr, UK"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Harkin","id":"37297997900"},{"name":"Thomas M.

However, as networks approach the biological scale with significantly large numbers of neurons, software simulations face the problem of scalability and increasing computation times. Thus, numerous researchers have targeted hardware implementations in an attempt to more closely replicate the parallel processing capabilities of biological networks. Reconfigurable hardware is seen as a particularly viable platform for attempting to replicate to some degree the natural plasticity and flexibility of the human brain. This paper presents a scalable FPGA based implementation approach that facilitates the accelerated emulation of large-scale SNNs. The approach is validated using a SNN-based edge detection application where an order of magnitude speed performance increase was observed in comparison to a software equivalent implementation.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272339","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272339.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","startPage":"670","endPage":"673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emulating Spiking Neural Networks for edge detection on FPGA hardware","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Emulating Spiking Neural Networks for edge detection on FPGA hardware","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272339/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893763","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5272339/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emulating Spiking Neural Networks for edge detection on FPGA hardware","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"P57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039463S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5272340,"authors":[{"name":"Folkert Horst","affiliation":["Zurich Research Laboratory, IBM Research GmbH, Ruschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Folkert","lastName":"Horst","id":"37267767900"},{"name":"William M.

This paper presents an architecture that benefits from the large number of DSP modules in Xilinx technology to implement massive floating point arithmetic. Our architecture computes the Phylogenetic Likelihood Function (PLF) which accounts for approximately 95% of total execution time in all state-of-the-art Maximum Likelihood (ML) based programs for reconstruction of evolutionary relationships. We validate and assess performance of our architecture against a highly optimized and parallelized software implementation of the PLF that is based on RAxML, which is considered to be one of the fastest and most accurate programs for phylogenetic inference. Both software and hardware implementations use double precision floating point arithmetic. The new architecture achieves speedups ranging from 1.6 up to 7.2 compared to a high-end 8-way dual-core general-purpose computer running the aforementioned highly optimized OpenMP-based multi-threaded version of the PLF.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reconfigurable architecture for the Phylogenetic Likelihood Function","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272341","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272341.pdf","startPage":"674","endPage":"678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"A reconfigurable architecture for the Phylogenetic Likelihood Function","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272341/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893764","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reconfigurable architecture for the Phylogenetic Likelihood Function","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"P58.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062896S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5272343,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua university, Beijing, China","Hardware Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Yan","id":"38010085900"},{"name":"Ning-Yi Xu","affiliation":["Hardware Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ning-Yi","lastName":"Xu","id":"37536072200"},{"name":"Xiong-Fei Cai","affiliation":["Hardware Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiong-Fei","lastName":"Cai","id":"37654170200"},{"name":"Rui Gao","affiliation":["Hardware Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Gao","id":"37651477400"},{"name":"Yu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua university, Beijing, China","Hardware Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293645500"},{"name":"Rong Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua university, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Luo","id":"37286614900"},{"name":"Feng-Hsiung Hsu","affiliation":["Hardware Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feng-Hsiung","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37360088300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272343","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based acceleration of neural network for ranking in web search engine with a streaming architecture","abstract":"Web search engine companies are intensively running learning to rank algorithms to improve the search relevance. Neural network (NN)-based approaches, such as LambdaRank, can significantly increase the ranking quality. While, their training is very slow on a single computer and inherent coarse-grained parallelism could be hardly utilized by computer clusters. Thus an efficient implementation is necessary to timely generate acceptable NN models on frequently updated training datasets. This paper presents our work in accelerator. A SIMD streaming architecture is proposed to i) efficiently map the query-level NN computation and data structure to FPGA, ii) fully exploit the inherent fine-grained parallelism, and iii) provide scalability to large scale datasets. The accelerator shows up to 17.9X speedup over the software implementation on datasets from a commercial search engine.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Neural networks","Web search","Search engines","Service oriented architecture","Concurrent computing","Computer architecture","Parallel processing","Clustering algorithms","Data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","field programmable gate arrays","Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","parallel algorithms","query processing","search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based acceleration","neural network-based approach","Web search engine ranking","SIMD streaming architecture","learning method","Web search relevance","LambdaRank algorithm","training method","coarse-grained parallelism","computer cluster","query-level NN computation","data structure","large-scale dataset scalability","software implementation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272343","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272343","startPage":"662","endPage":"665","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272343.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272343/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based acceleration of neural network for ranking in web search engine with a streaming architecture","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10893765","htmlLink":"/document/5272343/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based acceleration of neural network for ranking in web search engine with a streaming architecture","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"P55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079794S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5272344,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Manuel Romero-Ximil","affiliation":["Information Technology Laboratory, Cinvestav-Tamaulipas, Center for Research and Advanced Studies, Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, Mexico"],"firstName":"Jose Manuel","lastName":"Romero-Ximil","id":"38297827800"},{"name":"Arturo Diaz-Perez","affiliation":["Information Technology Laboratory, Cinvestav-Tamaulipas, Center for Research and Advanced Studies, Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, Mexico"],"firstName":"Arturo","lastName":"Diaz-Perez","id":"38282238100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272344","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Proteins","Acceleration","Amino acids","Predictive models","Sequences","Hydrogen","Circuit synthesis","Information technology","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA design","score function","protein energy calculation","Rosetta method","tertiary structure","protein function","tridimensional protein conformation","target sequence","amino acid","Rosetta scoring function","reconfigurable computing"]}],"abstract":"Rosetta method predicts the tertiary structure of proteins, which is important for determining protein function in an organism.

It is often required that a random number generator consists of digital logic blocks only, so that it can be implemented on reconfigurable platforms. Since randomness cannot be proved by statistical tests there is a need for a provably secure hardware random number generator. In order to provide a proof of security, an experimental investigation of various physical effects on reconfigurable platforms is needed. In this paper we focus on the effect of narrow transitions suppression in the logic gates. The estimation of this effect may be crucial for the validity of the security proof of a RNG design. We explain our views on how experiments on FPGA should be performed and we give description of the measurement setup. We show that up to 98% of the transitions are suppressed in our experimental FPGA setup.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random numbers generation: Investigation of narrowtransitions suppression on FPGA","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272359","startPage":"699","endPage":"702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272359.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272359","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Random numbers generation: Investigation of narrowtransitions suppression on FPGA","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272359/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893711","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random numbers generation: Investigation of narrowtransitions suppression on FPGA","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"P514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078245S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5272361,"authors":[{"name":"Abhranil Maiti","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Abhranil","lastName":"Maiti","id":"37545828500"},{"name":"Patrick Schaumont","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Schaumont","id":"37281913600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272361","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":124,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":1709},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272361","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ring oscillators","Field programmable gate arrays","Frequency","Manufacturing processes","Working environment noise","Hamming distance","Physics computing","Silicon","Hardware","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical unclonable function","ring oscillator","die-unique challenge-response function","chip authentication","cryptographic key generation","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"A silicon physical unclonable function (PUF), which is a die-unique challenge-response function, is an emerging hardware primitive for secure applications. It exploits manufacturing process variations in a die to generate unique signatures out of a chip. This enables chip authentication and cryptographic key generation. A ring oscillator (RO) based PUF is a promising solution for FPGA platforms. However, the quality factors of this PUF, which include uniqueness, reliability and attack resiliency, are negatively affected by environmental noise and systematic variations in the die. This paper proposes two methods to address these negative effects, and to achieve a higher reliability in an RO-based PUF. Both methods are empirically verified on a population of five FPGAs over varying environmental conditions, and demonstrate how practically useful RO-based PUF can be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272361","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272361.pdf","startPage":"703","endPage":"707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the quality of a Physical Unclonable Function using configurable Ring Oscillators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improving the quality of a Physical Unclonable Function using configurable Ring Oscillators","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272361/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893712","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272361/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the quality of a Physical Unclonable Function using configurable Ring Oscillators","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"P515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063257S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5272362,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenzo Lo Monte","affiliation":["General Dynamics Information Technology, Dayton, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5416606/5272362/5272362-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lorenzo Lo Monte (S'05) received the B.Sc.

The RF tomography approach requires a set of low-cost transmitters and receivers arbitrarily deployed on the surface of the ground or slightly buried. Using the principles of inverse scattering and diffraction tomography, a simplified theory for below-ground imaging is developed. In this paper, the principles and motivations in support of RF tomography are introduced. Furthermore, several inversion schemes based on arbitrarily deployed sensors are devised. Then, limitations to performance and system considerations are discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of RF tomography is demonstrated by presenting images reconstructed via the processing of synthetic data.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2029341","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5416606/05272362.pdf","startPage":"1128","endPage":"1137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2029341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio Frequency Tomography for Tunnel Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272362/","displayDocTitle":"Radio Frequency Tomography for Tunnel Detection","volume":"48","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11138176","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272362/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio Frequency Tomography for Tunnel Detection","sourcePdf":"tgrs-lomonte-2029341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093676S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5416606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"5416606","articleId":"5272362","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5272367,"authors":[{"name":"Grigorios Chrysos","affiliation":["Microprocessor and Hardware Laboratory Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Grigorios","lastName":"Chrysos","id":"37701706200"},{"name":"Euripides Sotiriades","affiliation":["Microprocessor and Hardware Laboratory Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Euripides","lastName":"Sotiriades","id":"37277850500"},{"name":"Ioannis Papaefstathiou","affiliation":["Microprocessor and Hardware Laboratory Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Papaefstathiou","id":"37269342000"},{"name":"Apostolos Dollas","affiliation":["Microprocessor and Hardware Laboratory Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Apostolos","lastName":"Dollas","id":"37277855500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272367","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Coprocessors","Hardware","Biological system modeling","Decoding","DNA","Data mining","Genetics","Bioinformatics","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","coprocessors","DNA","field programmable gate arrays","genetics","interpolation","Markov processes","table lookup","tree data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based coprocessor","gene finding problem","interpolated Markov model","IMM","biology problem","DNA decoding","genetic information extraction","bioinformatics algorithm","Glimmer algorithm","hardware architecture","sparse lookup table","tree-like memory structure","gene identification"]}],"abstract":"An important biology problem is the decoding of the DNA and the extraction of useful genetic information.

Variants of the AdNN have also been used to obtain other PR phenomena, and even blurring. An unsurmountable problem associated with the AdNN and the variants referred to above is that all of them require a quadratic number of computations. This is essentially because the NNs in each case are completely connected graphs. In this paper, we consider how the computations can be significantly reduced by merely using a linear number of computations. To achieves this, we extract from the original completely connected graph one of its spanning trees. We then address the problem of computing the weights for this spanning tree. This is done in such a manner that the modified tree-based NN has approximately the same input-output characteristics, and thus the new weights are themselves calculated using a gradient-based algorithm. By a detailed experimental analysis, we show that the new linear-time AdNN-like network possesses chaotic and PR properties for different settings. As far as we know, such a tree-based AdNN has not been reported, and the results given here are novel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272368/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10942707","pubMedId":"19789110","volume":"20","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5272368/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adachi-Like Chaotic Neural Networks Requiring <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">Linear</emphasis>-Time Computations by Enforcing a Tree-Shaped Topology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adachi-Like Chaotic Neural Networks Requiring <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">Linear</emphasis>-Time Computations by Enforcing a Tree-Shaped Topology","sourcePdf":"tnn-oommen-2030582.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106673S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5306478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5306478","articleId":"5272368","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5272373,"authors":[{"name":"Kristof Denolf","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Kristof","lastName":"Denolf","id":"37328296600"},{"name":"Stephen Neuendorffer","affiliation":["Xilinx Research Laboratories, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Neuendorffer","id":"37271629400"},{"name":"Kees Vissers","affiliation":["Xilinx Research Laboratories, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kees","lastName":"Vissers","id":"37281958500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272373","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272373","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Image processing","Kernel","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Design methodology","Computer vision","Hardware design languages","Optical design","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing kernel","C-to-gate","program streaming","C-to-FPGA synthesis technology","optical flow vision processing kernel","debayering vision processing kernel","embedded vision system","RTL description","HDL language"]}],"abstract":"Effectively exploiting the variety of computational and storage resources available in common FPGA architectures for complex applications, such as the real-time implementation of vision algorithms, is often difficult in standard HDL design methodologies.

The impact of the proposed approach on the design time, the FPGA resource consumption and the throughput is measured.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272373","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272373.pdf","startPage":"626","endPage":"630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using C-to-gates to program streaming image processing kernels efficiently on FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using C-to-gates to program streaming image processing kernels efficiently on FPGAs","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893717","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272373/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using C-to-gates to program streaming image processing kernels efficiently on FPGAs","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"P49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059123S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5272377,"authors":[{"name":"Nick Gasson","affiliation":["Department Computer Science, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Gasson","id":"38110962700"},{"name":"Neil Audsley","affiliation":["Department Computer Science, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Neil","lastName":"Audsley","id":"37267847500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272377","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of the SR programming language for complex FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272377.pdf","startPage":"617","endPage":"621","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272377","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Strontium","Computer languages","Field programmable gate arrays","Parallel processing","Hardware","Concurrent computing","Digital signal processing","Yarn","Application software","Circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C language","digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SR programming language","FPGA","complex IP-blocks","RAM","DSP","software language","high-level IPC","C-based synthesis tool"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272377","abstract":"Most existing approaches to targeting high-level software to FPGAs are based on extensions to C and do not map easily to the features and characteristics of modern FPGAs.

This paper names suitable example applications, identifies the class of prefix computations generically mappable to carry chains and presents a universal procedure to achieve this mapping by a transformation building upon the well-supported binary word addition.

It combines the desirable attributes of current memory technologies such as SRAM, DRAM, and flash memories (fast access time, low cost, high density, and non-volatility). It also solves the critical drawbacks of conventional MRAM technology: poor scalability and high write current. However, variations in process parameters can lead to a large number of cells to fail, severely affecting the yield of the memory array. In this paper, we analyzed and modeled the failure probabilities of STT MRAM cells due to parameter variations. Based on the model, we performed a thorough analysis of the impact of design parameters on parametric failures due to process variations. To achieve high memory yield without incurring expensive technology modification, we developed an efficient design paradigm from circuit and/or architecture perspective-to improve the robustness and integration density. The proposed technique effectively relaxes or completely decouples the conflicting design requirements for read stability, writability and cell area. It can be used at an early stage of the design cycle for yield enhancement.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Magnetic circuits","Random access memory","Read-write memory","Failure analysis","Flash memory","Costs","Scalability","Performance analysis","Circuit stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","magnetic storage","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust spin-torque transfer magnetic RAM","parametric failures","process variations","high memory yield"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spin-torque transfer (STT)","magnetic ram (MRAM)","memory yield","parametric failures"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272386","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2027907","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5634429/05272386.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2027907","startPage":"1710","endPage":"1723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Paradigm for Robust Spin-Torque Transfer Magnetic RAM (STT MRAM) From Circuit/Architecture Perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design Paradigm for Robust Spin-Torque Transfer Magnetic RAM (STT MRAM) From Circuit/Architecture Perspective","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272386/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","volume":"18","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5272386/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11661432","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Paradigm for Robust Spin-Torque Transfer Magnetic RAM (STT MRAM) From Circuit/Architecture Perspective","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-jli-2027907-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067264S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5634429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5634429","articleId":"5272386","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":5272387,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Zadnik","affiliation":["FIT, Brno University of Technology, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Zadnik","id":"37595754000"},{"name":"Marco Canini","affiliation":["DIST, University of Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Canini","id":"37595750400"},{"name":"Andrew W.

They are seriously threatened by spoof attacks, in which a forged biometric copy or artificially recreated biometric data of a legitimate user may be used to spoof a system. Meanwhile, feature alignment and quantization greatly degrade the accuracy of single biometric cryptosystems. In this paper, by trying to bind multiple biometrics to cryptography, a cryptosystem named multibiometric cryptosystem (MBC), is demonstrated from the theoretical point of view. First, an MBC with two fusion levels: fusion at the biometric level, and fusion at the cryptographic level, is formally defined. Then four models, namely biometric fusion model, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MN</i>\n-split model, nonsplit model, and package model, adopted at those two levels for fusion are presented. Shannon entropy analysis shows that even if the biometric ciphertexts and some biometric traits are disclosed, the new constructions still can achieve consistently data security and biometric privacy. In addition, the achievable accuracy is analyzed in terms of false acceptance rate/false rejection rate at each model. Finally, a comparison on the relative advantages and disadvantages of the proposed models is discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272398/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978396","htmlLink":"/document/5272398/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multibiometric Cryptosystem: Model Structure and Performance Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multibiometric Cryptosystem: Model Structure and Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"04tifs04-syang-part2-2033227.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176899S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5312766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5312766","articleId":"5272398","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5272403,"authors":[{"name":"Tanya Ignatenko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhovan University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/5312766/5272403/5272403-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tanya Ignatenko (S'06\u2013M'08) was born in Minks, Belarus, in 1978.

Four settings are investigated. The first one is the standard Ahlswede-Csiszar secret-generation setting in which two terminals observe two correlated sequences. They form a common secret by interchanging a public message. This message should only contain a negligible amount of information about the secret, but here, in addition, we require it to leak as little information as possible about the biometric data. For this first case, the fundamental tradeoff between secret-key and privacy-leakage rates is determined. Also for the second setting, in which the secret is not generated but independently chosen, the fundamental secret-key versus privacy-leakage rate balance is found. Settings three and four focus on zero-leakage systems. Here the public message should only contain a negligible amount of information on both the secret and the biometric sequence. To achieve this, a private key is needed, which can only be observed by the terminals. For both the generated-secret and the chosen-secret model, the regions of achievable secret-key versus private-key rate pairs are determined. For all four settings, the fundamental balance is determined for both unconditional and conditional privacy leakage.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5312766/05272403.pdf","startPage":"956","endPage":"973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biometric Systems: Privacy and Secrecy Aspects","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2009.2033228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2009.2033228","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272403/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Biometric Systems: Privacy and Secrecy Aspects","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978397","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5272403/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biometric Systems: Privacy and Secrecy Aspects","sourcePdf":"tifs-ignatenko-part2-2033228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119585S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5312766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"5312766","articleId":"5272403","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5272406,"authors":[{"name":"Mariette Awad","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Department, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Mariette","lastName":"Awad","id":"37683857600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272406","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1275},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Supercomputers","Microprocessors","Application software","Acceleration","High performance computing","Random access memory","Hardware","Concurrent computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","parallel machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA supercomputing platform","field programmable gate arrays","microprocessors","supercomputing cluster","computer system","application specific performance","reconfigurable computing FPGA","high performance computing","FPGA supercomputing architecture","FPGA based supercomputer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272406","abstract":"Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) inherent reconfigurable nature and their low power consumption have made them so complementary to microprocessors that many are advocating their inclusion in all supercomputing clusters.

We propose the triple modular redundancy (TMR) scheme coupled with dynamic partial reconfiguration to remove SEUs from the configuration memory of the FPGA. Although the FPGA is subject to SEUs, these errors can be corrected as a result of its reconfigurability. Furthermore, we consider the synchronization after a partial reconfiguration using an interrupt process of an RTOS. Experimental results reveal that one faulty softcore processor is recovered and synchronized with the other softcore processors. The present study demonstrates that a softcore processor can recover from an SEU using the proposed dynamic partial reconfiguration and the synchronization process.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272423.pdf","startPage":"543","endPage":"546","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel states recovery technique for the TMR softcore processor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Single event transient","Single event upset","Random access memory","Redundancy","Error correction","Circuit faults","Process design","Electrical fault detection","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["states recovery technique","field programmable gate arrays","softcore processor","Single Event Upsets","Triple Modular Redundancy","dynamic partial reconfiguration","configuration memory","synchronization process","SRAM-based field programmable gate arrays","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"A novel states recovery technique for the TMR softcore processor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272423/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893781","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel states recovery technique for the TMR softcore processor","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"P32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083288S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5272429,"authors":[{"name":"Hideki Mutoh","affiliation":["Link Research Corporation, Odawara, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5290333/5272429/5272429-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hideki Mutoh (M'90) received the B.S. degree in physics from Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 1980, the M.S. degree from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, in 1982, and the Ph.D. degree from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 2008.","He joined Fuji Photo Film Company, Ltd., in 1982, where he worked on the research and development of solid-state imaging devices including both MOS and CCD types.

A smaller cell needs a shorter focal length microlens, which can be realized by inner lens structures in CCD or the waveguide structures in CMOS image sensors.

However, their main drawback is the cost, and the necessary space required to incorporate their external associated peripherals. This disadvantage is especially significant in the low-cost consumer market, where factors such as price and size determine the viability of a product. The use of an FPGA is a suited way to implement systems that require a high computational capability at affordable prices. Besides, these devices allow the design of complex digital systems with outstanding performances in terms of execution times.

The performance of an automated iris recognition system is affected by the accuracy of the segmentation process used to localize the iris structure. Most segmentation models in the literature assume that the pupillary, limbic, and eyelid boundaries are circular or elliptical in shape. Hence, they focus on determining model parameters that best fit these hypotheses. However, it is difficult to segment iris images acquired under nonideal conditions using such conic models. In this paper, we describe a novel iris segmentation scheme employing geodesic active contours (GACs) to extract the iris from the surrounding structures. Since active contours can 1) assume any shape and 2) segment multiple objects simultaneously, they mitigate some of the concerns associated with traditional iris segmentation models. The proposed scheme elicits the iris texture in an iterative fashion and is guided by both local and global properties of the image. The matching accuracy of an iris recognition system is observed to improve upon application of the proposed segmentation algorithm. Experimental results on the CASIA v3.0 and WVU nonideal iris databases indicate the efficacy of the proposed technique.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2009.2033225","startPage":"824","endPage":"836","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5312766/05272431.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2009.2033225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iris Segmentation Using Geodesic Active Contours","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active contours","Image segmentation","Robust stability","Iris recognition","Biometrics","Authentication","Eyelids","Active shape model","Iterative algorithms","Image databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","image recognition","image segmentation","image texture","iterative methods","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geodesic active contours","iris texture","personal authentication","automated iris recognition system","iterative fashion","iris segmentation","CASIA v3.0","WVU nonideal iris databases"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Geodesic active contours (GACs)","iriscodes","iris recognition","iris segmentation","level sets","snakes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272431/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Iris Segmentation Using Geodesic Active Contours","volume":"4","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5272431/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10978401","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iris Segmentation Using Geodesic Active Contours","sourcePdf":"04tifs04-aross-part2-2033225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072512S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5312766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"186","xplore-issue":"5312766","articleId":"5272431","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5272436,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew J.

The controller can be retrofitted to any scanning probe microscope with position sensors by implementing a simple digital controller or operational amplifier circuit. The controller is demonstrated to improve the tracking bandwidth of an NT-MDT scanning probe microscope from 15 Hz (with an integral controller) to 490 Hz while simultaneously improving gain-margin from 2 to 7 dB. The penalty on sensor induced positioning noise is minimal. A unique benefit of the proposed control scheme is the performance and stability robustness with respect to variations in resonance frequency. This is demonstrated experimentally by a change in resonance frequency from 934 to 140 Hz. This change does not compromise stability or significantly degrade performance. For the scanning probe microscope considered in this paper, the noise is marginally increased from 0.30 to 0.39 nm rms. Open and closed-loop experimental images of a calibration standard are reported at speeds of 1, 10, and 31 lines per second (with a scanner resonance frequency of 290 Hz). Compared with traditional integral controllers, the proposed controller provides a bandwidth improvement of greater than 10 times. This allows faster imaging and less tracking lag at low speeds.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272436/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11414277","volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5272436/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Method for Robust Damping and Tracking Control of Scanning Probe Microscope Positioning Stages","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Method for Robust Damping and Tracking Control of Scanning Probe Microscope Positioning Stages","sourcePdf":"tnano-fleming-2032418-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094467S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"5504884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"5504884","articleId":"5272436","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5272447,"authors":[{"name":"Cem Savas Bassoy","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Technology, Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Cem Savas","lastName":"Bassoy","id":"38294951800"},{"name":"Henning Manteuffel","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Technology, Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Henning","lastName":"Manteuffel","id":"38275389700"},{"name":"Friedrich Mayer-Lindenberg","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Technology, Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Friedrich","lastName":"Mayer-Lindenberg","id":"38270359200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272447","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","VLIW","Computer aided instruction","Registers","Logic","Size control","Yarn","Delay","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic","instruction sets","logic design","microcontrollers","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SHARF architecture","FPGA-based customizable soft processor architecture","Harvard architecture","ALU","SIMD","VLIW","microcontroller","floating point data type"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a general architecture for soft processors based on a modified Harvard architecture, SHARF.

They share in common a linear variation of the Doppler centroid along the azimuth dimension, which is due to a steering of the antenna (either mechanically or electronically) throughout the data take. Existing approaches for the azimuth processing can become inefficient due to the additional processing to overcome the folding in the focused domain.

The possibility to use the proposed approach to process data acquired in the ScanSAR mode, as well as a discussion concerning staring spotlight, is also included. Simulations with point targets and real data acquired by TerraSAR-X in sliding spotlight and TOPS modes are used to validate the developed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2027701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5393894/05272449.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2027701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393894","startPage":"770","endPage":"780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Processing of Sliding Spotlight and TOPS SAR Data Using Baseband Azimuth Scaling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Processing of Sliding Spotlight and TOPS SAR Data Using Baseband Azimuth Scaling","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272449/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"48","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11071333","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5272449/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Processing of Sliding Spotlight and TOPS SAR Data Using Baseband Azimuth Scaling","sourcePdf":"tgrs-prats-2027701.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165052S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5393894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"5393894","articleId":"5272449","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5272451,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios N.

This paper presents a comparative study of four alternative instance preference learning algorithms (both linear and nonlinear). The case study investigated is to learn to predict the expressed entertainment preferences of children when playing physical games built on their personalized playing features ( \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">entertainment modeling</i>\n). Two of the approaches are derived from the literature-the large-margin algorithm (LMA) and preference learning with Gaussian processes-while the remaining two are custom-designed approaches for the problem under investigation: meta-LMA and neuroevolution. Preference learning techniques are combined with feature set selection methods permitting the construction of effective preference models, given suitable individual playing features. The underlying preference model that best reflects children preferences is obtained through neuroevolution: 82.22% of cross-validation accuracy in predicting reported entertainment in the main set of game survey experimentation. The model is able to correctly match expressed preferences in 66.66% of cases on previously unseen data (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n -value = 0.0136) of a second physical activity control experiment.

Existing and new TDI sensor architecture concepts with snapshot shutter, rolling shutter, or orthogonal readout are presented. An optimization method is then introduced to inject modulation transfer function and quantum efficiency specification in the architecture definition. Moderate spatial and temporal oversamplings are combined to achieve near charge-coupled device (CCD) class performances, resulting in an acceptable design complexity. Finally, CCD and CMOS dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio are conceptually compared.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5290333/05272462.pdf","startPage":"2524","endPage":"2533","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2030648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2030648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290333","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Delay-Integration Architectures in CMOS Image Sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","CMOS integrated circuits","Arrays","Charge coupled devices","Radiation detectors","Noise","Adders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","optimisation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-delay-integration architectures","CMOS image sensors","time-delay-integration functionality","synchronization","TDI sensor architecture","snapshot shutter","optimisation method","quantum efficiency specification","signal-to-noise ratio","charge-coupled device class performances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic modulation transfer function (MTF)","image sensor","optical transfer functions","pushbroom","time-delay integration (TDI)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Time-Delay-Integration Architectures in CMOS Image Sensors","volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5272462/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10929336","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Delay-Integration Architectures in CMOS Image Sensors","sourcePdf":"ted-lepage-2030648.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054203S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5290333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5290333","articleId":"5272462","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5272463,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Liu","affiliation":["II.

In this paper, we propose to use direct memory access (DMA), master (MST) burst, and a dedicated block RAM (BRAM) cache respectively to reduce the reconfiguration time. Based on the Xilinx PR technology and the Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP) primitive in the FPGA fabric, we discuss multiple design architectures and thoroughly investigate their performance with measurements for different partial bitstream sizes. Compared to the reference OPB HWICAP and XPS HWICAP designs, experimental results show that DMA HWICAP and MST HWICAP reduce the reconfiguration time by one order of magnitude, with little resource consumption overhead. The BRAM HWICAP design can even approach the reconfiguration speed limit of the ICAP primitive at the cost of large block RAM utilization.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272463.pdf","startPage":"498","endPage":"502","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Run-time Partial Reconfiguration speed investigation and architectural design space exploration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Space exploration","Field programmable gate arrays","Read-write memory","Random access memory","Fabrics","Hardware","Energy consumption","Throughput","Writing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","random-access storage","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["run-time partial reconfiguration speed investigation","architectural design space exploration","fast IP core switching","direct memory access cache","master burst cache","dedicated block RAM cache","Xilinx PR technology","Internal Configuration Access Port","ICAP","FPGA fabric","partial bitstream size","OPB HWICAP design","XPS HWICAP design","DMA HWICAP design","MST HWICAP design","BRAM HWICAP design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Run-time Partial Reconfiguration speed investigation and architectural design space exploration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272463/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893793","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Run-time Partial Reconfiguration speed investigation and architectural design space exploration","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"P22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052636S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5272464,"authors":[{"name":"Cuong Vo Le","affiliation":["Kinki University, Higashi, Osaka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5290333/5272464/5272464-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cuong Vo Le received the B.Eng. and M.S. degrees in electronics and telecommunications from Hanoi University of Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in ultrahigh-speed and ultrahigh-sensitivity camera field from Kinki University, Osaka, Japan, in 2009.","In 2004, he was a Research Associate with the School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

We propose a set of criteria upon which an effective comparative analysis of the performance of wide-DR (WDR) sensors can be done. Sensors for WDR are divided into seven categories: 1) companding sensors; 2) multimode sensors; 3) clipping sensors; 4) frequency-based sensors; 5) time-to-saturation (time-to-first spike) sensors; 6) global-control-over-the-integration-time sensors; and 7) autonomous-control-over-the-integration-time sensors. The comparative analysis for each category is based upon the quantitative assessments of the following parameters: signal-to-noise ratio, DR extension, noise floor, minimal transistor count, and sensitivity. These parameters are assessed using consistent assumptions and definitions, which are common to all WDR sensor categories. The advantages and disadvantages of each category in the sense of power consumption and data rate are discussed qualitatively. The influence of technology advancements on the proposed set of criteria is discussed as well.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2030599","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5290333/05272465.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2030599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290333","startPage":"2446","endPage":"2461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide-Dynamic-Range CMOS Image Sensors\u2014Comparative Performance Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wide-Dynamic-Range CMOS Image Sensors\u2014Comparative Performance Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272465/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10929337","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5272465/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-Dynamic-Range CMOS Image Sensors\u2014Comparative Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"ted-yadidpecht-2030599.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10399S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5290333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5290333","articleId":"5272465","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5272469,"authors":[{"name":"Roy Porter","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Air Force Institute of Technology, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Roy","lastName":"Porter","id":"38112398800"},{"name":"Samuel J.

As recommended for WiMAX, we assume that the first part of the available bandwidth is likely to be reused by different base stations (and is thus subject to multicell interference) and that the second part of the bandwidth is shared in an orthogonal way between the different base stations (and is thus protected from multicell interference). Although the problem of multicell resource allocation is nonconvex in this scenario, we provide in Part I the general form of the global solution. In particular, the optimal resource allocation turns out to be \u00bfbinary\u00bf in the sense that, except for at most one pivot-user in each cell, any user receives data either in the reused bandwidth or in the protected bandwidth, but not in both. The determination of the optimal resource allocation essentially reduces to the determination of the latter pivot-position.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Downlink Cellular OFDMA Systems\u2014Part I: Optimal Allocation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2033301","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5379139/05272480.pdf","startPage":"720","endPage":"734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2033301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272480","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272480/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Downlink Cellular OFDMA Systems\u2014Part I: Optimal Allocation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5272480/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054881","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Downlink Cellular OFDMA Systems\u2014Part I: Optimal Allocation","sourcePdf":"58tsp02-nksairi-2033301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108292S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5379139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5379139","articleId":"5272480","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5272481,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292963000"},{"name":"Rick S.

Using the proposed method a resolution of less than 140 ps can be achieved using a Xilinx's Virtex-4 FPGA.

As a result, they must be stored in off-chip SDRAMs and loaded onto the FPGAs as computations progress. Because of the high latency and energy consumption associated with off-chip memory accesses, it is important to develop efficient operation schedules that not only minimize latency of computations, but also the amount of data I/Os. We formulate this problem as a modified resource-constrained job scheduling problem. The problem is then solved using a list scheduling algorithm that takes advantage of the fast burst-mode access of SDRAMs. Results have shown that for large problem sizes, the performance of our algorithm is within 1% of a hand-optimized matrix-matrix multiplication implementation, with no memory overhead, and is within 0.03% of the theoretical minimum latency of an 8-by-8 cofactor matrix computation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893729","htmlLink":"/document/5272497/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Operation scheduling for FPGA-based reconfigurable computers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operation scheduling for FPGA-based reconfigurable computers","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"P111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047432S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5272498,"authors":[{"name":"A.

As architectures advance to accommodate more bits/cell and geometries decrease to structures that are smaller than 32 nm, single-bit error-correction codes (ECCs) are unable to compensate for the increasing array bit error rates, making it imperative to use 2-b ECC. However, 2-b ECC algorithms are complex and add a timing overhead on the memory read access time. This paper proposes low-latency multibit ECC schemes. Starting with the binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes, an optimized scheme is introduced which combines a multibit error-correcting BCH code with Hamming codes in a hierarchical manner to give an average latency as low as that of the single-bit correcting Hamming decoder. A Hamming algorithm with 2-b error-correcting capacity for very small block sizes (< 1 B) is another low-latency multibit ECC algorithm that is discussed. The viability of these methods and algorithms with respect to latency and die area is proved vis-a\u00bf-vis software and hardware implementations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash

In this paper, we present two concepts to support a multi-FPGA architecture for stochastic restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM), a popular type of neural network. First, a hardware core, called the kth stage piecewise linear interpolator, is used to implement a high-precision, pipelined function generator. The interpolator increases the resolution of a look up table implementation, guaranteeing an additional bit of precision for every pipeline stage. This function generator is used to implement a sigmoid function required in stochastic node selection. Next, a partitioning algorithm is used to efficiently divide a RBM amongst multiple FPGAs. The partitioning algorithm optimizes performance by minimizing the inter-FPGA communication. The architecture is tested on the Berkeley Emulation Engine 2 running at 100 MHz. One board supports a RBM of 256 times 256 nodes, and results in a computational speed of 1.85 billion connection-updatesper- second and a speed-up of 85-fold over an optimized C program running on a 2.8 GHz Intel processor.","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272516.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-FPGA architecture for stochastic Restricted Boltzmann Machines","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272516/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"A multi-FPGA architecture for stochastic Restricted Boltzmann Machines","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893657","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5272516/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-FPGA architecture for stochastic Restricted Boltzmann Machines","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"M3C1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05102S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5272523,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Wildermann","affiliation":["Hardware/Software-Co-Design, University of Erlangen, Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Wildermann","id":"37669339300"},{"name":"Gregor Walla","affiliation":["Hardware/Software-Co-Design, University of Erlangen, Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Gregor","lastName":"Walla","id":"37974724100"},{"name":"Tobias Ziermann","affiliation":["Hardware/Software-Co-Design, University of Erlangen, Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Ziermann","id":"37393193600"},{"name":"Juergen Teich","affiliation":["Hardware/Software-Co-Design, University of Erlangen, Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Juergen","lastName":"Teich","id":"37276355800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272523","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"abstract":"Self-organization is a natural concept that helps complex systems to adapt themselves autonomically to their environment.

The system adapts to changes in the environment while tracking a person. Besides this, system customization can be simplified. The designer just has to select a desired set of image filters for a given task. The system then finds the appropriate parameters, e.g., the weighting of different cues. With the option of partial re-configuration, FPGAs support this type of customization. An FPGA-based prototype implementation demonstrates the feasibility of this approach.

Recent GPUs support a large number of cores, and have a potential for high performance in many applications. However, the cores are grouped, and data transfer between the groups is very limited. Programming tools for FPGA, SIMD instructions on CPU and a large number of cores on GPU have been developed, but it is still difficult to achieve high performance on these platforms.

Spatial and temporal bases are employed to capture the aspects of the evoked response that are consistent across trials. Trial amplitudes are assumed independent but have the same underlying normal distribution with unknown mean and variance. The trial latency is assumed to be deterministic but unknown. We assume that the noise is spatially correlated with unknown covariance matrix. We introduce a generalized expectation\u2013maximization algorithm called <emphasis emphasistype=\"underline\">Tri</emphasis>al <emphasis emphasistype=\"underline\">V</emphasis>ariability in <emphasis emphasistype=\"underline\">A</emphasis>mplitude and <emphasis emphasistype=\"underline\">L</emphasis>atency ( <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">TriViAL</emphasis>) that computes the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the amplitudes, latencies, basis coefficients, and noise covariance matrix. The proposed approach also performs ML source localization by scanning the TriViAL algorithm over spatial bases corresponding to different locations on the cortical surface. Source locations are identified as the locations corresponding to large likelihood values. The effectiveness of the TriViAL algorithm is demonstrated using simulated data and human evoked response experiments. The localization performance is validated using tactile stimulation of the finger. The efficacy of the algorithm in estimating latency variability is shown using the known dependence of the M100 auditory response latency to stimulus tone frequency. We also demonstrate that estimation of response amplitude is improved when latency is included in the signal model. </para>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatiotemporal phenomena","Electroencephalography","Delay","Amplitude estimation","Covariance matrix","Maximum likelihood estimation","Frequency estimation","Gaussian distribution","Expectation-maximization algorithms","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","expectation-maximisation algorithm","magnetoencephalography","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatiotemporal framework","MEG evoked response amplitude","EEG evoked response amplitude","latency variability estimation","single-trial response latencies","magnetoencephalographic data","electroencephalographic data","generalized expectation-maximization algorithm","Trial Variability in Amplitude and Latency","TriViAL","maximum likelihood estimates","noise covariance matrix","cortical surface","simulated data","human evoked response experiments","finger tactile stimulation","M100 auditory response latency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplitude and/or latency variability","evoked response magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography (MEG/EEG)","expectation\u2013maximization (EM)","independent response","maximum likelihood (ML)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Electroencephalography","Evoked Potentials","Fingers","Humans","Magnetoencephalography","Reproducibility of Results","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2032533","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5419290/05272536.pdf","startPage":"616","endPage":"625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2032533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Spatiotemporal Framework for MEG/EEG Evoked Response Amplitude and Latency Variability Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Spatiotemporal Framework for MEG/EEG Evoked Response Amplitude and Latency Variability Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272536/","volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272536/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11138813","pubMedId":"19789097","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Spatiotemporal Framework for MEG/EEG Evoked Response Amplitude and Latency Variability Estimation","sourcePdf":"tbme-limpiti-2032533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094261S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5419290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5419290","articleId":"5272536","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5272537,"authors":[{"name":"Jason H.

Results show that while circuits mapped to a traditional 5-LUT architecture need 14% more LUTs and have 12% more depth than a 6-LUT architecture, our extended 5-LUT architecture requires only 7%more LUTs and 2.5% more depth than 6-LUTs, on average. Nearly all of the depth reduction associated with moving from K-input to K+1-input LUTs can be achieved with considerably less area using extended K-LUTs. We further show that 6-LUT optimal mapping depths can be achieved with a small fraction of the LUTs in hardware being 6-LUTs and the remainder being extended 5-LUTs, suggesting that a heterogeneous logic block architecture may prove to be advantageous.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272537","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272537.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","startPage":"105","endPage":"111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improving logic density through synthesis-inspired architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272537/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10893664","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving logic density through synthesis-inspired architecture","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"M2C1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057851S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5272538,"authors":[{"name":"Safeen Huda","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Safeen","lastName":"Huda","id":"38108487900"},{"name":"Muntasir Mallick","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Muntasir","lastName":"Mallick","id":"38101225100"},{"name":"Jason H.

The objective in this paper is a reduction of the resource requirements for implementing the reconfiguration control on the FPGA. First, we extend our existing tool flow with a novel mechanism for efficient partial multi-context reconfiguration and provide tool support to generate according circuitry, control, and configuration data. Second, we propose an extension of current FPGA architectures to efficiently support cycle-based runtime control.

Recent research has demonstrated that soft processors augmented with support for vector instructions provide significant improvements in performance and scalability for data parallel workloads. These soft vector processors provide a software environment for quickly encoding data parallel computation, but their competitiveness with manual hardware design in terms of area and performance remains unknown. In this work, using an FPGA platform equipped with DDR memory executing data-parallel EEMBC embedded benchmarks, we measure the area/performance gaps between (i) a scalar soft processor, (ii) our improved soft vector processor, and (iii) custom FPGA hardware. We demonstrate that the 432times wall clock performance gap between scalar executed C and custom hardware can be reduced significantly to 17times using our improved soft vector processor, while silicon-efficiency is improved by 3times in terms of area delay product. We modified the architecture to mitigate three key advantages we observed in custom hardware: loop overhead, data delivery, and exact resource usage. Combined these improvements increase performance by 3times and reduce area by almost half, significantly reducing the need for designers to resort to more challenging custom hardware implementations.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272551","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272551.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data parallel FPGA workloads: Software versus hardware","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Data parallel FPGA workloads: Software versus hardware","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272551/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893672","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data parallel FPGA workloads: Software versus hardware","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"M1C2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05372S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5272553,"authors":[{"name":"Florent de Dinechin","affiliation":["LIP (CNRS/INRIA/ENS-Lyon/UCBL),Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Florent","lastName":"de Dinechin","id":"37347508700"},{"name":"Cristian Klein","affiliation":["LIP (CNRS/INRIA/ENS-Lyon/UCBL),Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Klein","id":"38546500200"},{"name":"Bogdan Pasca","affiliation":["LIP (CNRS/INRIA/ENS-Lyon/UCBL),Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Pasca","id":"37545456300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"5272553","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":284},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","Field programmable gate arrays","Open source software","Computer architecture","Frequency synthesizers","Automatic testing","Detectors","Digital signal processing","Logic","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic","hardware description languages","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating-point pipeline","FPGA","open-source architecture generator","VHDL","frequency-directed pipeline","automatic test-bench generation"]}],"abstract":"Custom operators, working at custom precisions, are a key ingredient to fully exploit the FPGA flexibility advantage for high-performance computing.

Its salient features are an easy learning curve from VHDL, the ability to embed arbitrary synthesizable VHDL code, portability to mainstream FPGA targets from Xilinx and Altera, automatic management of complex pipelines with support for frequency-directed pipeline, and automatic test-bench generation.

SRAM-based FPGAs, however, are susceptible to radiation-induced single-event upsets (SEUs) when deployed in space environments. These effects are often handled with the area and power-intensive TMR mitigation technique. This paper evaluates the effects of SEUs in the FPGA configuration memory as noise in a digital filter, showing that many SEUs in a digital communications system cause effects that could be considered noise rather than circuit failure. Since DSP and digital communications applications are designed to withstand certain types of noise, SEU mitigation techniques that are less costly than TMR may be applicable. This could result in large savings in area and power when implementing a reliable system. Our experiments show that, of the SEUs that affected the digital filter with a 20 dB SNR input signal, less than 14% caused an SNR loss of more than 1 dB at the output.","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272554.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"43","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise impact of single-event upsets on an FPGA-based digital filter","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272554","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Noise impact of single-event upsets on an FPGA-based digital filter","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893674","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5272554/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise impact of single-event upsets on an FPGA-based digital filter","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"M1B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050621S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5272559,"authors":[{"name":"Clement Farabet","affiliation":["Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Clement","lastName":"Farabet","id":"37392217400"},{"name":"Cyril Poulet","affiliation":["Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Poulet","id":"37392214900"},{"name":"Jefferson Y.

Along with point-to-point send and receive message primitives, MPI includes a set of collective communication operations that are used to synchronize and coordinate groups of tasks. The MPI_Barrier, one of the most important collective procedures, has been extensively studied on a variety of architectures over last twenty years. However, a cluster of Platform FPGAs is a new architecture and offers interesting, resource-efficient options for implementing the barrier operation. This paper describes an FPGA implementation of MPI_Barrier. The premise is that barrier (and other collective communication operations) are very sensitive to latency as the number of nodes scales to the tens-of-thousands. The relatively slow processors found on FPGAs will significantly cap performance. The FPGA hardware design implements a tree-based algorithm and is tightly integrated with the custom high-speed on-chip/off-chip network. MPI access is available through a specially-designed kernel module. This effectively offloads the work from the CPU and OS into hardware. The evaluation of this design shows significant performance gains compared with a conventional software implementation on both an FPGA cluster and a commodity cluster. Further, it suggests that moving other MPI collective operations into hardware would be beneficial.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation of MPI_Barrier on an FPGA cluster","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272560","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272560.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of MPI_Barrier on an FPGA cluster","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272560/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893678","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of MPI_Barrier on an FPGA cluster","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"M1A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082806S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5272561,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Labrecque","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Labrecque","id":"37595733000"},{"name":"J.

Previous work has demonstrated that support for multithreading in soft processors can tolerate pipeline and I/O latencies as well as improve overall system throughput-however earlier work assumes an abundance of completely independent threads to execute. In this work we show that for real workloads, in particular packet processing applications, there is a large fraction of processor cycles wasted while awaiting the synchronization of shared data structures, limiting the benefits of a multithreaded design. We address this challenge by proposing a method of scheduling threads in hardware that allows the multithreaded pipeline to be more fully utilized without significant costs in area or frequency. We evaluate our technique relative to conventional multithreading using both simulation and a real implementation on a NetFPGA board, evaluating three deep-packet inspection applications that are threaded, synchronize, and share data structures, and show that overall packet throughput can be increased by 63%, 31%, and 41% for our three applications.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272561","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272561.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fast critical sections via thread scheduling for FPGA-based multithreaded processors","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893679","htmlLink":"/document/5272561/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast critical sections via thread scheduling for FPGA-based multithreaded processors","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"M1A3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087126S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247666","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5272229","articleId":"5272561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5272565,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This involves many challenges, including power management, device modeling, increasing I/O performance to match the computational capacity, and enabling very large designs to be completed quickly. Process scaling increases FPGA capacity and allows new features, such as high-performance I/O protocols (e.g. PCI Express). Scaling favours FPGAs over competing technologies, as fewer and fewer ASICs have the volumes to justify the cost of a design in cutting-edge technology. I will give an overview of the challenges in designing a cutting-edge FPGA, and describe the solutions Altera has adopted in its 40 nm Stratix IV FPGAs. I/O bandwidth is crucial. While the density of FPGAs is increasing rapidly, the number of I/O pins is not-we need to move more bits through the same number of pins. Another challenge is to model the timing, power and signal integrity of increasingly complex FPGAs in increasingly variable processes, while still keeping the tools easy to use. Managing power is a third challenge. Each process generation roughly doubles the number of transistors per die and tends to increase leakage power. The power budget per FPGA is roughly constant, so we need to innovate to control power. Ever larger FPGAs also necessitate innovation to keep designers productive. We must both keep the compile time of traditional FPGA CAD tools reasonable, and develop new tools that allow designers to create and verify more complex systems in the same time.","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247666/5272229/05272567.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2009.5272567","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2009.5272567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA challenges and opportunities at 40nm and beyond","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA challenges and opportunities at 40nm and beyond","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272567/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893683","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA challenges and opportunities at 40nm and beyond","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"K4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032512S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","isNumber":"5272229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247666","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5272567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5272597,"authors":[{"name":"Junjun Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Junjun","lastName":"Li","id":"37422481900"},{"name":"Robert Gauthier","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, IBM Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Essex Junction, VT, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Gauthier","id":"37282540300"},{"name":"Elyse Rosenbaum","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Elyse","lastName":"Rosenbaum","id":"37274772700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5853-7063-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5272597","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":981},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clamps","Electrostatic discharge","Protection","Feedback circuits","Power supplies","MOS capacitors","Trigger circuits","Leakage current","Threshold voltage","Research and development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascade networks","circuit feedback","electrostatic discharge","MOSFET","RC circuits","trigger circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET-based power clamp","on-chip ESD protection","cascaded PFET feedback technique","RC trigger circuit","dynamic feedback technique"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272597","doi":"10.1109/EOSESD.2004.5272597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EOSESD.2004.5272597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272572","publicationTitle":"2004 Electrical Overstress/Electrostatic Discharge Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 Electrical Overstress/Electrostatic Discharge Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5238477/5272572/05272597.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact, timed-shutoff, MOSFET-based power clamp for on-chip ESD protection","abstract":"We present a novel RC-triggered, MOSFET-based power clamp for on-chip ESD protection.

This distance-dependent route-selection problem is approached from the viewpoint of energy efficiency, where a route is selected with the objective of minimizing the transmission energy consumed while satisfying a target outage criterion at the final destination. Deterministic line networks and 2-D random networks are considered. It is shown that short-hop routing requires less energy than long-hop routing when (1) the number of hops traversed between the source and destination grows large, (2) the target success probability approaches one, or (3) the number of transmit and/or receive antennas grows large. It is also shown that if both routing strategies are subject to the same delay constraint, long-hop routing requires less energy than short-hop routing as the target success probability approaches one. In addition, a numerical analysis indicates that, given loose outage constraints, only a small number of transmit antennas are needed for short-hop routing to have its maximum advantage over long-hop routing, while given stringent outage constraints, the advantage of short-hop over long-hop routing always increases with additional transmit antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5383378/05272670.pdf","startPage":"394","endPage":"405","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2033075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2033075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383378","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy-Based Comparison of Long-Hop and Short-Hop Routing in MIMO Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","MIMO","Digital relays","Transmitting antennas","Signal processing","Wireless networks","Spread spectrum communication","Radio frequency","Energy efficiency","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","power consumption","receiving antennas","space division multiplexing","telecommunication network routing","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-based comparison","long-hop routing","short-hop routing","MIMO networks","multiple-antenna nodes","spatial multiplexing","distance-dependent route-selection","transmission energy minimization","target outage criterion","2-D random networks","deterministic line networks","target success probability","transmit antennas","receive antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Large-antenna limits","multiple antennas","random networks","relays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272670/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Energy-Based Comparison of Long-Hop and Short-Hop Routing in MIMO Networks","volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5272670/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11070336","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy-Based Comparison of Long-Hop and Short-Hop Routing in MIMO Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-lo-2033075.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123356S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5383378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5383378","articleId":"5272670","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5272671,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37403808600"},{"name":"Hong-Chuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Hong-Chuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37278138800"},{"name":"Young-Chai Ko","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Chai","lastName":"Ko","id":"37279007700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5272671","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","MIMO","Diversity reception","Feedback","Signal to noise ratio","Array signal processing","Broadcasting","Feeds","Statistical analysis","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","broadcast channels","diversity reception","MIMO communication","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random unitary beamforming","low-complexity transmission scheme","multiple-input-multiple-output channels","MIMO broadcast channels","sum-rate performance","diversity reception","selection combining","optimum combining","feedback load reduction","signal- to-interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channels","optimum combining (OC)","random unitary beamforming (RUB)","selection combining (SC)","sum-rate analysis"]}],"abstract":"Random unitary beamforming (RUB) is an attractive low-complexity transmission scheme for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channels. In this paper, we study the sum-rate performance of RUB-based multiuser MIMO systems with receive diversity. Two combining techniques, i.e., selection combining (SC) and optimum combining (OC), are employed to reduce feedback load and improve sum-rate performance. With these combining techniques, each user only needs to feed back one beam index and the corresponding output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). For the SC scheme, we derive the statistics of the output SINR and the exact analytical expression of the sum rate. For the OC scheme, we develop an upper bound of the sum rate in the high-signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) region. The bound is shown to be tight for the case of a moderate number of users, but the number of users must be at least five times the number of transmit antennas. Selected numerical examples show that the proposed design greatly enhances the sum-rate performance while maintaining low feedback load.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2033226","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5383378/05272671.pdf","startPage":"490","endPage":"494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2033226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis for RUB-Based Multiuser MIMO Systems With Antenna Diversity Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272671/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis for RUB-Based Multiuser MIMO Systems With Antenna Diversity Techniques","volume":"59","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11070335","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272671/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis for RUB-Based Multiuser MIMO Systems With Antenna Diversity Techniques","sourcePdf":"tvt-yang-2033226.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108636S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5383378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5383378","articleId":"5272671","onlineDate":"29 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5272673,"authors":[{"name":"Zoi-Heleni Michalopoulou","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5416603/5272673/5272673-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zoi-Heleni Michalopoulou (S'85\u2013M'94\u2013SM'02) received the Diploma degree in electrical engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece, in 1988 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Duke University, Durham, NC, in 1990 and 1993, respectively.","She is currently a Professor with the Department of Mathematical Sciences, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ.

Compared with traditional microprocessor-based systems, fast growing FPGA technology offers a more powerful, efficient, and flexible hardware platform. An effort is presented herein to embed algorithms to process nonlinear time series by entirely using an FPGA, while an ongoing effort is to pursue the development of an FPGA and microprocessor co-design for a more extended and robust version of this study. The Hilbert transform (HT) and a backbone curve technique are the centerpiece to extract instantaneous characteristics of a displacement time history from a under free vibration. Critical design issues are carefully considered including required approximation accuracy, constraints imposed by limited hardware resources, timing in the execution of the hardware design, and data representations in a fixed-point design environment. An automation of the classification of three basic types of SDOF systems (including linear, hardening and softening) are implemented for wireless transmission of processed results. An off-the-shelf high-level abstraction tool along with the MATLAB/Simulink environment is utilized to program the FPGA, rather than coding the hardware description language (HDL) manually. Extensive validation using simulated data is conducted for every step/stage of the design as well as major built-in functions adopted from the hardware design tool. The contribution of this study includes (1) enabling the functionality of a full hardware design for an enhanced computational efficiency in wireless structural health monitoring and (2) achieving balance between computational efficiency and resource utilization for onboard data processing especially when non-high-end FPGA products are targeted for practical consideration in structural health monitoring.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2009.2019322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/5257354/05272820.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2009.2019322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5257354","startPage":"1486","endPage":"1493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded Algorithms Within an FPGA to Classify Nonlinear Single-Degree-of-Freedom Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272820","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Embedded Algorithms Within an FPGA to Classify Nonlinear Single-Degree-of-Freedom Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272820/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10902941","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5272820/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded Algorithms Within an FPGA to Classify Nonlinear Single-Degree-of-Freedom Systems","sourcePdf":"jsen-jpei-2019322.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063587S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5257354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5257354","articleId":"5272820","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5272913,"authors":[{"name":"Bob Pfahl","affiliation":["INEMI, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Bob","lastName":"Pfahl","id":"38110867600"},{"name":"Jim Arnold","affiliation":["INEMI, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Arnold","id":"38101713500"},{"name":"Grace O'Malley","affiliation":["INEMI, Limerick, Ireland"],"firstName":"Grace","lastName":"O'Malley","id":"37601682000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4722-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-6152-9868-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5272913","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manufacturing industries","Electronics industry","Industrial electronics","Supply chains","Electronic equipment testing","Medical tests","Assembly","Composite materials","Tin","Life estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","electronics industry","reliability","solders","supply chains","testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closing technology knowledge gaps","iNEMI technology roadmap","electronic manufacturing supply chain","higher-density testing","nanosolders","lead-free alloy","international electronics manufacturing initiative","consensus-based strategy","medical component reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Environmental","Pb-free","HFR-free","Nano-solder","Boundary Scan Test","Functional Test","Medical Electronics","Miniaturization"]}],"abstract":"iNEMI has been publishing its technology roadmap biannually for the last 14 years. The strength of these roadmaps has been the depth of the knowledge from experts worldwide combined with the breath of view taken across the whole electronic manufacturing supply chain. Every new roadmap helps identify the technology gaps in various aspects of the supply chain. These gaps then stimulate and encourage dialogue to develop consensus-based strategies resulting in industry-based joint project work or promoting research areas to the academic communities. Since 2007, there has been a focus on three main technology areas for iNEMI industry-based projects: energy and the environment, miniaturization and medical electronics. This paper will cover the goals of these three areas and the strategies being adopted to address the present and future technology gaps, as identified in the most recent roadmaps. Results from key projects in the three areas will be presented. These will include projects on Pb-free alloy alternatives and HFR-free substrates; higher density testing and nanosolders, and medical components reliability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closing technology knowledge gaps: Projects arising from the iNEMI technology roadmap","publicationTitle":"2009 European Microelectronics and Packaging Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Microelectronics and Packaging Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5238690/5272842/05272913.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Closing technology knowledge gaps: Projects arising from the iNEMI technology roadmap","conferenceDate":"15-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272913/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10893518","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closing technology knowledge gaps: Projects arising from the iNEMI technology roadmap","confLoc":"Rimini, Italy","sourcePdf":"EMPC198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041573S","chronDate":"15-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5238690","isNumber":"5272842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5238690","xplore-issue":"5272842","articleId":"5272913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IMAPS-Italy","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5272957,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A major market is medical point-of-care (POC) and other kinds of portable diagnostics. Such systems require assembly and fluidic interconnection among the microfluidic elements and other components. However, microfluidic chips have until now been produced in relatively small numbers. While the structuring methods to make the fluidic channels are based on well established micro-manufacturing techniques such as lithography and embossing and are in general suited to mass manufacture, packaging and assembly methods require development for larger manufacturing volumes. One problem is with reliable sealing of a capping layer to the microfluidic layer for large area polymer wafers. In conventional thermocompression bonding the high pressures and need to heat the whole thickness of the polymer stack leads to potential distortion of the microfluidic structures. We present results on trials on the use of low frequency induction heating to deliver heat directly to the bonding interface thus permitting the use of lower bond pressures. The selection and structuring of susceptor materials is reported, together with analysis of the dimensions of the heat affected zone. Acrylic plates have been joined using a thin (<10 mum) nickel susceptor providing a fluid seal that withstood a fluid pressure of 590 kPa. Another problem is how to provide support structures for connection of capillary tubing or for directly connecting microfluidic chips together to form systems. We propose the use of polymer overmoulding to create a meso-scale fluidic manifold, with anticipated advantages for manufacturing of ease of assembly and low part count. Results on the reliability of the fluid seal achieved by direct adhesion between overmould materials and glass are presented. A demonstrator overmoulded structure to connect a glass microfluidic chip to capillary tubing, using a compliant grommet for sealing, is also reported.","publicationTitle":"2009 European Microelectronics and Packaging Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Microelectronics and Packaging Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5238690/5272842/05272957.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Processes for integration of microfluidic based devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5272957","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5272957/","displayDocTitle":"Processes for integration of microfluidic based devices","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10893561","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5272957/","conferenceDate":"15-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Processes for integration of microfluidic based devices","confLoc":"Rimini, Italy","sourcePdf":"EMPC137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083202S","chronDate":"15-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5238690","isNumber":"5272842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5238690","xplore-issue":"5272842","articleId":"5272957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IMAPS-Italy","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5273808,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos R.

The SCA is a product of the American military's SDR acquisition program and has played a large role in SDR development in the military and in the wireless industry. OSSIE was designed for use in wireless communications curricula and research efforts, so it is easy to learn and illustrative of software engineering, programming, and communications engineering concepts important in industrial practice today. OSSIE includes a core framework (i.e., common services enumerated in the SCA). It also includes graphical user interface-oriented tools that are easily learned and free to download and use. The tools auto-generate SCA-specific component source code and supporting files, leaving the developer to provide signal processing functionality. In addition, visualization tools for debugging and a growing library of SDR software components are available. Discussed herein are examples of SDRs designed using OSSIE, including embedded applications. OSSIE enables easy transition from concepts to practice in SDR design for communications engineers who may not have a strong software background.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5273796/05273808.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"55","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2009.5273808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2009.5273808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5273796","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5273808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open-source SCA-based core framework and rapid development tools enable software-defined radio education and research","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Open source software","Defense industry","Design engineering","Educational products","Educational programs","Software design","Software prototyping","Software radio","Computer architecture","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","graphical user interfaces","military communication","public domain software","software engineering","software radio","telecommunication computing","telecommunication engineering education"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software defined radio education","open source software development kit","software communications architecture","software engineering","communications engineering","component source code","Open Source SCA Implementation::Embedded project","American military","SDR acquisition program","wireless industry","OSSIE","wireless communications curricula","graphical user interface-oriented tools","visualization tools","Open-Source SCA-based core framework"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5273808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Open-source SCA-based core framework and rapid development tools enable software-defined radio education and research","volume":"47","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5273808/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2009","accessionNumber":"10903094","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open-source SCA-based core framework and rapid development tools enable software-defined radio education and research","sourcePdf":"012AGUAYO GONZALEZ LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07722S","chronDate":"October  2009","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5273796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5273796","articleId":"5273808","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5273809,"authors":[{"name":"Niranjan Suri","affiliation":["Florida Institute of Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), USA"],"bio":{"p":["Niranjan Suri [m] is a research scientist at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC).

However, significant work is needed at the upper layers to better support application requirements. In our experience, achieving effective communications in tactical environments requires taking into account application requirements and communication patterns, designing a rich interface between the application and communication layers, and realizing a communications middleware specifically adapted to tactical networks. In this article, we report on our observations from several tactical networking experiments and demonstrations and the lessons learned from deployment of the Mockets middleware to support tactical communications.

In 2006 ITU-T started a standardization project called G.hn for a unified next generation networking technology, operating over all types of in-home wiring (phone line, power line, coaxial cable, and Cat-5 cable). ITU-T Recommendation G.9960, consented in December 2008, is the G.hn foundation: it specifies network architecture, most of the PHY, and some aspects of the MAC. The complete Recommendation is expected within 2009. Besides residential premises, G.hn is intended for small/home offices and public places such as multiple dwelling units, hotels, and conference rooms.

The two objectives-service cost (operational cost) and waiting time (customer satisfaction) are, therefore, conflicting in nature. In this paper, we cast the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and use the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to optimize the two conflicting objective functions simultaneously. MOPSO is a fairly recent swarm intelligence meta-heuristic algorithm known for its simplicity in programming and its rapid convergence. The multi-objective optimization procedure is illustrated with the example of a practical service system.

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive system identification using time-varying Fourier transform","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on the Applications of Digital Information and Web Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ICADIWT.2009.5273902","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on the Applications of Digital Information and Web Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5254891/5273826/05273902.pdf","startPage":"652","endPage":"657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICADIWT.2009.5273902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5273826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5273902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5273902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive system identification using time-varying Fourier transform","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5273902/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10905896","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive system identification using time-varying Fourier transform","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"714diwt.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049315S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254891","isNumber":"5273826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254891","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5273826","articleId":"5273902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5273951,"authors":[{"name":"Rodney S.

Optimization refers to maximizing radio coverage while minimizing equipment and maintenance costs. A comparative analysis of both the genetic algorithm and tabu search was undertaken. The effects of changing the population size as well as the type of selection were investigated for the genetic algorithm while the size of the candidate list and tabu tenure were examined for the tabu search. It was determined that the genetic algorithm performed best when tournament selection was employed with a population size of 10. A tabu tenure set to 1 and a candidate list size of 10 engendered the most optimal performance of the tabu list. Utilization of each algorithm's most optimal parameters allowed us to effectively compare the performances of the genetic algorithm with those of the tabu search.","doi":"10.1109/ICADIWT.2009.5273951","pdfPath":"/iel5/5254891/5273826/05273951.pdf","startPage":"640","endPage":"645","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on the Applications of Digital Information and Web Technologies","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on the Applications of Digital Information and Web Technologies","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICADIWT.2009.5273951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5273826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cell planning using genetic algorithm and tabu search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5273951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cell planning using genetic algorithm and tabu search","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10905938","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5273951/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cell planning using genetic algorithm and tabu search","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"557diwt.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055878S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254891","isNumber":"5273826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254891","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5273826","articleId":"5273951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5273957,"authors":[{"name":"Zaidah Ibrahim","affiliation":["Faculty of Comp & Math.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) have gained great interest in the last few years in pattern recognition. Thus, this research compares the recognition performance of text and non-text images (text, table, figure and graph) from technical document images based on the pixel intensity of various zones between BPNN, SOM, RNN and SVM. Symmetrical and non-symmetrical zoning algorithms were compared as input. 400 different datasets have been tested and the experiments indicate that SVM classification is superior to the other three classifiers. The experiments also indicate that the combination of symmetrical and non-symmetrical zoning design is better than non-symmetrical or symmetrical zoning only.","doi":"10.1109/ICADIWT.2009.5273957","pdfPath":"/iel5/5254891/5273826/05273957.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"350","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on the Applications of Digital Information and Web Technologies","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on the Applications of Digital Information and Web Technologies","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICADIWT.2009.5273957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5273826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Document zone content classification for technical document images using Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5273957/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Document zone content classification for technical document images using Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10905944","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5273957/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Document zone content classification for technical document images using Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"505diwt.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061142S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254891","isNumber":"5273826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254891","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5273826","articleId":"5273957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5273979,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel Lukas","affiliation":["Informatics Engineering, Computer Science Faculty, Universitas Pelita Harapan, Tangerang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Lukas","id":"38112703400"},{"name":"Arnold Aribowo","affiliation":["Computer Engineering, Computer Science Faculty, Universitas Pelita Harapan, Tangerang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Arnold","lastName":"Aribowo","id":"37828635700"},{"name":"Milyandreana Muchri","affiliation":["Informatics Engineering, Computer Science Faculty, Universitas Pelita Harapan, Tangerang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Milyandreana","lastName":"Muchri","id":"38109410500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4456-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4457-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5273979","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Genetic mutations","Genetic engineering","Computer science","Processor scheduling","Informatics","Poles and towers","Testing","Education"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["educational administrative data processing","genetic algorithms","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","heuristic search","timetable problem","Universitas Pelita Harapan timetable","scheduling problem","lecturer availabilities"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5273979","abstract":"Scheduling problem is a model of complicated problem.

The modulator, incorporating with a 24-bit sine wave source, a 1-bit DAC and a subsequent reconstruction filter, generates a signal to test a high-precision sigma-delta ADC. The test signal, which contains both sine wave and high frequency noise, is sampled by the ADC under test. Usually, the noise in the test signal can not be fully suppressed by subsequent decimation filters of the ADC. So decimation filters should be taken into account for designing the modulator. To compensate for the noise suppression limitation of the decimation filters, zero points are introduced to the noise band of the modulator noise transfer function (NTF). With the adding of these noise band zero points, the SNR of ADC output data reaches 115 dB in the range of 0~500 Hz, which is about 10 dB higher than that of a system without these zero points.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235876/5273983/05274097.pdf","startPage":"4-160","endPage":"4-164","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","doi":"10.1109/ICEMI.2009.5274097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMI.2009.5274097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5273983","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5274097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A FPGA-based 7-order 1-bit sigma-delta modulator for high-precision signal generation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delta-sigma modulation","Signal generators","Frequency","Circuit testing","Low pass filters","Degradation","Signal design","System testing","Physics","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit noise","field programmable gate arrays","FIR filters","IIR filters","sigma-delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based sigma-delta modulator","high-precision signal generation","noise band","sine wave source","reconstruction filter","high-precision sigma-delta ADC","noise suppression limitation","decimation filters","modulator noise transfer function","frequency 0 Hz to 500 Hz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["zero points","sigma-delta modulator","noise transfer function","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5274097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A FPGA-based 7-order 1-bit sigma-delta modulator for high-precision signal generation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5274097/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10962956","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A FPGA-based 7-order 1-bit sigma-delta modulator for high-precision signal generation","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064208S","chronDate":"16-19 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235876","isNumber":"5273983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235876","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5273983","articleId":"5274097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5274103,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Yuyan","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Yuyan","id":"37692639900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3863-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3864-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5274103","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Multiaccess communication","Shadow mapping","Base stations","Bit error rate","Instruments","Interference","Mathematical model","Frequency","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","fading channels","mathematical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","bit error rate","fading channel","multiple base station"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["shadowing correlation","CDMA system","BER"]}],"abstract":"Shadowing relevant mathematical models was introduced in this paper. Spatial correlation of shadow fading depends not only on the distances between bases, but also on environment and frequency. Shadow fading can manifest itself in the degradation of the Rice channel when base stations are closely spaced. In Nakagami fading and correlated shadowing environment, the bit error rate (BER) performance of CDMA Systems was observed lower in a correlated shadowing environment compared with the uncorrelated case. Macro-diversity effects are apparent when there are multiple base stations. However, as the number of base stations increases beyond three for a cell, the effectiveness of macro-diversity decreases. Based on CDMA system, the effects of shadowing correlation is analyzed, LS code is more robust than Walsh and PN code.","doi":"10.1109/ICEMI.2009.5274103","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235876/5273983/05274103.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5273983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMI.2009.5274103","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","startPage":"4-19","endPage":"4-22","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shadow fading correlation on CDMA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5274103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Shadow fading correlation on CDMA system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5274103/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10962962","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shadow fading correlation on CDMA system","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029666S","chronDate":"16-19 Aug. 2009","isNumber":"5273983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235876","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5274103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5274152,"authors":[{"name":"Peiliang Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Huzhou Teacher''s College, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China","Institute of Electrical Automatic Control, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Peiliang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085860110"},{"name":"Wuming He","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Huzhou Teacher''s College, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Wuming","lastName":"He","id":"38103149900"},{"name":"Wenjun Yan","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Automatic Control, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Yan","id":"37405020800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3863-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3864-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5274152","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5274152","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Elevators","Wavelet packets","Fuzzy neural networks","Signal processing","Fault detection","Footwear","Frequency","Spline","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["braking","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","fault diagnosis","fuzzy neural nets","lifts","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elevator braking system","wavelet packet algorithm","fuzzy neural network","brake shoe gap-time signals","B-spline","fault diagnosis model","eigenvalue"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wavelet packet","fuzzy neural network","fault diagnosis","elevator braking system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICEMI.2009.5274152","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235876/5273983/05274152.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","startPage":"4-1028","endPage":"4-1031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5273983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMI.2009.5274152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault diagnosis of elevator braking system based on wavelet packet algorithm and fuzzy neural network","abstract":"Aiming at the fault features of the elevator braking system, the basic characteristics of three faults types are analysised.

Comparing with the conventional neural network, the radial basis function neural network possesses characteristic of simple structure, fast convergence and strong generalization, it is suitable for real-time control. Considering the change of iron core loss resistance due to flux and frequency, a precise dynamic model of induction motor is built, and RBFNN is trained based on this model. When induction motor is in steady state, the trained RBFNN is used to optimize flux-producing current; while when induction motor is in the transient state, the flux-producing current recovers the rated value for ensuring the fast response. The simulation is done with Matlab/Simulink and the proposed method of control is realized adopting TMS320LF2407A.

detection method of adaptive digital lock-in amplifier based on particle swarm optimization algorithm","abstract":"In this paper, an intelligent algorithm - particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to adaptively realize weak sinusoidal signal detection of digital lock-in amplifier. Each particle is a reference signal. Using this algorithm PSO first searches the optimum particle of particle swarm, and then estimates the corresponding parameters of input useful signal through the messages of the optimum particle. The algorithm can realize detection of weak signal by modifying its some parameters, so it is more convenient and flexible than the method of traditional lock-in amplifier (LIA) in application. Computer simulation results show that this method can accurately detect multiple useful sinusoidal signals which are inundated by strong noise of -40 dB, and also detect AM signal. Then the effectiveness of this method is verified by AM signal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5274545/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10963187","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5274545/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Weak signal detection method of adaptive digital lock-in amplifier based on particle swarm optimization algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weak signal detection method of adaptive digital lock-in amplifier based on particle swarm optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"2436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063825S","chronDate":"16-19 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235876","isNumber":"5273983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235876","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5273983","articleId":"5274545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5274555,"authors":[{"name":"Whitney Hsiong","affiliation":["Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Whitney","lastName":"Hsiong","id":"38108992100"},{"name":"Steve Huntzicker","affiliation":["Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Huntzicker","id":"37660343400"},{"name":"Kevin King","affiliation":["Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"King","id":"38112859900"},{"name":"Austin Lee","affiliation":["Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Austin","lastName":"Lee","id":"38102074600"},{"name":"Chen Lim","affiliation":["Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Lim","id":"38106991700"},{"name":"Jason Wang","affiliation":["Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Wang","id":"38107541700"},{"name":"Sarah Harris","affiliation":["Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sarah","lastName":"Harris","id":"37553329700"},{"name":"Jorg-Micha Jahn","affiliation":["Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jorg-Micha","lastName":"Jahn","id":"38100203900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3863-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3864-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5274555","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance and area tradeoffs in space-qualified FPGA-based time-of-flight systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235876/5273983/05274555.pdf","startPage":"2-1","endPage":"2-5","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMI.2009.5274555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5273983","doi":"10.1109/ICEMI.2009.5274555","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Flip-flops","Plasma measurements","Clocks","Delay lines","Integrated circuit measurements","Costs","Area measurement","Hardware design languages","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","logic testing","measurement systems","space vehicle electronics","temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-qualified FPGA-based time-of-flight system","FPGA-based design","radiation-tolerant time-of-flight system","Actel ProASIC 3E A3PE1500","Actel RTAX 2000 S/SL","fast-clocking design","temperature sensor","TOF measurement system","spaceflight instrumentation","time 0 ns to 240 ns","frequency 1.63 MHz to 40 MHz","power 396 mW to 448 mW","temperature -25 C to 55 C"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5274555","abstract":"This paper introduces four FPGA-based designs for radiation-tolerant time-of-flight (TOF) systems for sub-atomic particles: Snapshot, Vernier, Fast-Clocking and Hybrid designs.

Its performance was assessed by the predistortion effects in terms of NMSE, RMSE and ACEPR yielded by its inverse function, namely AM predistorter (PD) in HPA digital predistortion (DPD). The use of this PD allows the HPA DPD to be implemented by only taking into consideration the compensation for the distortion signals, while the ones in the linear region of HPA don't need to process, thus greatly reducing the required memory storage capacity for the AM LUT. Moreover, the PD makes it feasible to implement HPA DPD by manually adjusting the parameter values, therefore the complexity can be avoided due to a feedback loop and the iterative predistortion algorithm. Simulation results show the PD can admirably balance between predistortion accuracy and implementation complexity. Accordingly, it is testified that the proposed AM model provides a good tradeoff between the precision and complexity in approximating the AM nonlinearity in TWTA driven by OFDM signals.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5273983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMI.2009.5274807","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235876/5273983/05274807.pdf","startPage":"1-55","endPage":"1-58","doi":"10.1109/ICEMI.2009.5274807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mathematical model for amplitude distortion in nonlinear HPA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Mathematical model for amplitude distortion in nonlinear HPA","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5274807/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10962843","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5274807/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mathematical model for amplitude distortion in nonlinear HPA","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040652S","chronDate":"16-19 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235876","isNumber":"5273983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235876","xplore-issue":"5273983","articleId":"5274807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5274809,"authors":[{"name":"Cao Peng","affiliation":["School of Information and Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Graphic Communications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cao","lastName":"Peng","id":"37291374600"},{"name":"Wang Mingfei","affiliation":["School of Information and Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Graphic Communications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Mingfei","id":"37645164100"},{"name":"Qi Wei","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Wei","id":"37300595000"},{"name":"Fei Yuanchun","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Yuanchun","id":"37297791600"},{"name":"Tian Haiyan","affiliation":["School of Information and Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Graphic Communications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Haiyan","id":"38100072800"},{"name":"Meng Fanjun","affiliation":["School of Information and Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Graphic Communications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Fanjun","id":"38111201100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3863-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3864-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5274809","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Sampling methods","Jitter","Circuits","Signal sampling","Signal processing","Computer errors","Phase noise","Phase measurement","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","phase noise","signal sampling","timing jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clock distribution","parallel/interleaved sampling","gain error","phase shift error","aperture jitter error","multichannel sampling","analog-to-digital conversion circuit","phase noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["parallel/interleaved A/D converter","clock distribution","jitter","phase noise"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5274809","doi":"10.1109/ICEMI.2009.5274809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMI.2009.5274809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5273983","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235876/5273983/05274809.pdf","startPage":"1-543","endPage":"1-546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The design of clock distribution in the parallel/interleaved sampling system","abstract":"The paper introduced the mathematical model in both time and frequency domain of parallel/interleaved sampling system, the total gain error, phase shift error, aperture jitter error of multi-channel sampling scheme are all involved.

In one four-axis AMB there are usually more than ten switching devices to be controlled. Therefore FPGA is a good platform for the implementation of three-level PWM. A three-level PWM scheme used on h-bridge power amplifiers for AMBs is presented. The FPGA solution for that three-level scheme is given in detail. The setup and results of the test experiment with a digital power amplifier board featured a XC3S1000 FPGA are presented.

The network-based location estimation schemes have been widely adopted based on the radio signals between the mobile device and the base stations. The location estimators associated with the Kalman filtering techniques are exploited to both acquire location estimation and trajectory tracking for the mobile devices. However, most of the existing schemes become inapplicable for location tracking due to the deficiency of signal sources. In this paper, two predictive location tracking algorithms are proposed to alleviate this problem. The predictive location tracking (PLT) scheme utilizes the predictive information obtained from the Kalman filter in order to provide the additional signal inputs for the location estimator. Furthermore, the geometric-assisted PLT (GPLT) scheme incorporates the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) information into the algorithm design. Persistent accuracy for location tracking can be achieved by adopting the proposed GPLT scheme, especially with inadequate signal sources. Numerical results demonstrate that the GPLT algorithm can achieve better precision in comparison with other network-based location tracking schemes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2009.75","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5291226/05274920.pdf","startPage":"1676","endPage":"1689","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2009.75","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Location Tracking Algorithms for Environments with Insufficient Signal Sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Location Tracking Algorithms for Environments with Insufficient Signal Sources","volume":"8","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5274920/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10940666","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5274920/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Location Tracking Algorithms for Environments with Insufficient Signal Sources","sourcePdf":"ttm2009121676.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086078S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5291226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5291226","articleId":"5274920","onlineDate":"02 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":5274924,"authors":[{"name":"Aravind Heragu","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Aravind","lastName":"Heragu","id":"37542521100"},{"name":"Viswanathan Balasubramanian","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Viswanathan","lastName":"Balasubramanian","id":"37543608800"},{"name":"Christian Enz","affiliation":["Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology, Neuchatel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Enz","id":"37269686200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3896-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5274924","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":325},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5274924","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Clocks","Baseband","Radio frequency","Circuits","Capacitors","Mixers","Filters","Filtering","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","mixers (circuits)","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrent quadrature sub-sampling mixer","multiband receiver","Spectre RF simulation","CMOS process","size 0.18 mum"]}],"abstract":"A quadrature sub-sampling direct conversion mixer capable of sampling two or more bands concurrently using a single sampling frequency is presented.

A prototype is designed on a FPGA for measurement and demonstration, and synthesis for 65 nm CMOS process provides estimates for area and power consumption in an ASIC implementation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2009.5274927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5274921","startPage":"283","endPage":"286","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247537/5274921/05274927.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum estimator and cyclostattionary detector for cognitive radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5274927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5274927/","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum estimator and cyclostattionary detector for cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10905143","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum estimator and cyclostattionary detector for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"b1lc49274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062493S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247537","isNumber":"5274921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247537","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5274921","articleId":"5274927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5274929,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In the standard approach the nonlinear elements are extracted from the linear part and the linear part is reduced. A large number of nonlinear elements leads to a large number of ports for the interconnection of linear and nonlinear network parts which is a strong limitation for the reduction. A method for the reduction of the number of ports of the linear part which enables a more efficient model order reduction with standard projection techniques is presented. The method is based on decomposition of the equations of the nonlinear elements which are explicitly described by one current or voltage function. By reducing an example model the method is illustrated and validated.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reduced order systems","Integrated circuit interconnections","Pins","State-space methods","Voltage","Circuit simulation","Computational modeling","Vectors","Electronic mail","Nonlinear equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interconnections","linear network analysis","nonlinear network analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear networks","nonlinear elements","interconnection","nonlinear network","linear network","projection techniques","voltage function","current function"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2009.5274929","publicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247537/5274921/05274929.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5274921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2009.5274929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model reduction of linear networks with nonlinear elements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5274929","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model reduction of linear networks with nonlinear elements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5274929/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5274929/","accessionNumber":"10905145","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model reduction of linear networks with nonlinear elements","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"b1ld29234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066198S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247537","isNumber":"5274921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247537","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5274921","articleId":"5274929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5274934,"authors":[{"name":"Dalibor Biolek","affiliation":["Department of EE/Microelectronics, UD Brno, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Dalibor","lastName":"Biolek","id":"37332028300"},{"name":"Zdenek Biolek","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Roznov p.R., SSIER, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zdenek","lastName":"Biolek","id":"38476990700"},{"name":"Viera Biolkova","affiliation":["Department of Radio Electronics, BUT, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Viera","lastName":"Biolkova","id":"37332024000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3896-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5274934","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":100,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1522},"abstract":"A methodology of SPICE modeling of general memristive, memcapacitative, and meminductive systems is proposed and their special cases such as memristors (MR), memcapacitors (MC), and meminductors (ML) are given.

However, one of the most common problems in op-amp design is the variation in the op-amp's performance caused by process variations during fabrication. As such, it is of utmost importance that provisions be made on the op-amp to compensate for possible deviations in performance after chip fabrication. In this paper, a procedure on integrating programmable bias networks into an operational amplifier is developed. The programmable network driven by digital input words makes the output bias currents and voltages variable, thus making the op-amp tunable for proper operation even after chip fabrication. Furthermore, the programmability of other op-amp parameters such as gain, slew rate, and compensation are explored to increase the capability and flexibility of the op-amp. The programmability schemes are employed on two base op-amp topologies namely, the Two-stage Miller and the Folded Cascode. The project is implemented in a standard 90 nm CMOS process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5274950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5274950/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10905166","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of operational amplifiers with programmable characteristics in a 90nm CMOS process","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of operational amplifiers with programmable characteristics in a 90nm CMOS process","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"a4pf19010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034729S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247537","isNumber":"5274921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247537","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5274921","articleId":"5274950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":5274955,"authors":[{"name":"M.

By exploiting to the nonlinear optimization ability of CNN spatio-temporal dynamics, optimal binary and reconstruction image can be obtained. However, in the conventional SD-CNN, the Gaussian LPF, whose coefficients are real number, is used as the A-template.

Usually, such devices draw their energy from a contact-based power supply. This power-supply connection is often exploited to extract the secret key by applying fault-injection methods and power-analysis attacks. In this article, we present implementation attacks on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags which are usually powered contactlessly by an electromagnetic field. We describe a contact-based measurement setup that allows both injection of faults and measuring of the power consumption of passive RFID tags. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our setup by providing practical results of attacks on commercially available HF and UHF RFID tags. The results have led us to the conclusion that RFID tags are as susceptible to such attacks as contact-based powered devices. Appropriate countermeasures are needed to thwart these attacks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5274921","publicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247537/5274921/05275012.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2009.5275012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2009.5275012","startPage":"409","endPage":"412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contact-based fault injections and power analysis on RFID tags","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275012/","displayDocTitle":"Contact-based fault injections and power analysis on RFID tags","htmlLink":"/document/5275012/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10905227","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contact-based fault injections and power analysis on RFID tags","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"b2ld69210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058828S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247537","isNumber":"5274921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247537","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5274921","articleId":"5275012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5275017,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The achieved frequency response of designed filters match those obtained by HFSS simulator software and are much better than those obtained by the classical methods, such as Butterworth, Chebyshev and elliptic filters.","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2009.5275068","startPage":"639","endPage":"642","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247537/5274921/05275068.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2009.5275068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5274921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of stepped-impedance low pass filters with impedance matching by the particle swarm optimization and conjugate gradient method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low pass filters","Impedance matching","Particle swarm optimization","Gradient methods","Matched filters","Least squares methods","Design optimization","Minimization methods","Character generation","Dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","impedance matching","least squares approximations","low-pass filters","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stepped-impedance low pass filter design","impedance matching","particle swarm optimization","conjugate gradient method","least square method","error function minimization","dispersion relation","step discontinuity equivalent circuit","HFSS simulator software","Butterworth filter","Chebyshev filter","elliptic filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of stepped-impedance low pass filters with impedance matching by the particle swarm optimization and conjugate gradient method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5275068/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10905283","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of stepped-impedance low pass filters with impedance matching by the particle swarm optimization and conjugate gradient method","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"c1ld59289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056542S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247537","isNumber":"5274921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247537","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5274921","articleId":"5275068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5275070,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios Stefanou","affiliation":["Department Elektrotechniek, ESAT/MICAS, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Athanasios","lastName":"Stefanou","id":"37541378300"},{"name":"Georges Gielen","affiliation":["Department Elektrotechniek, ESAT/MICAS, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Georges","lastName":"Gielen","id":"37275184800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3896-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5275070","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Interpolation","Crosstalk","Circuit noise","Low-frequency noise","Active noise reduction","Noise cancellation","Voltage","Filters","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comparators (circuits)","distortion","integrating circuits","interpolation","random noise","transfer functions","transistor circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling noise","substrate noise","adaptive interpolation","interpolation filter","regenerative comparator","sampling distortion","sampling switch","random noise","charge-domain sampling","active Miller integrator","sampling transistor","moving-average filter","deterministic signal","random signal","transfer function","signal frequency","adaptive response","substrate-noise-affected flash converter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5275070","abstract":"This paper presents an interpolation filter scheme for regenerative comparators to suppress the induced sampling distortion resulting from the input-dependent timing error of the comparator's sampling switches and furthermore alleviates the impact of random noise coupled from the substrate. The proposed scheme is based on the concept of charge-domain sampling and is realized by incorporating an active Miller integrator in the comparator. The integrator in conjunction with the sampling transistor makes each branch of the comparator a moving-average filter, which is effective for both deterministic and random signals. Moreover, the filter self-adjusts its transfer function according to the undesired signal's frequency providing a more general and adaptive response. The effectiveness of the scheme is validated for both cases of interference on the comparator and the model is subsequently used to estimate the compensated SNR of a substrate-noise-affected flash converter.","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2009.5275070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2009.5275070","startPage":"631","endPage":"634","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247537/5274921/05275070.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5274921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigation of the sampling and substrate noise induced distortion in regenerative comparators by adaptive interpolation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Mitigation of the sampling and substrate noise induced distortion in regenerative comparators by adaptive interpolation","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5275070/","accessionNumber":"10905285","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275070/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigation of the sampling and substrate noise induced distortion in regenerative comparators by adaptive interpolation","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"c1ld39270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037586S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247537","isNumber":"5274921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247537","xplore-issue":"5274921","articleId":"5275070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5275073,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Zanini","affiliation":["Laboratory of Integrated Systems, EPF Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Zanini","id":"37543014200"},{"name":"David Atienza","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Laboratory, EPF Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Atienza","id":"37275656500"},{"name":"Luca Benini","affiliation":["Micrel Laboratory, DEIS, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Benini","id":"37274443600"},{"name":"Giovanni De Micheli","affiliation":["Laboratory of Integrated Systems, EPF Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"De Micheli","id":"37274174300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3896-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5275073","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":407},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thermal management","Multicore processing","Predictive models","Predictive control","Power system management","Frequency","Temperature","Energy management","Laboratories","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time systems","multiprocessing systems","optimal control","predictive control","system-on-chip","temperature control","thermal management (packaging)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicore thermal management","model predictive control","smooth thermal control action","discrete-time optimal control problem","optimization process","thermal balancing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5275073","abstract":"The goal of thermal management is to meet maximum operating temperature constraints, while at the same time tracking time-varying performance requirements. Current approaches avoid thermal violations by forcing abrupt operating points changes (e.g. processor shutdown), which cause sharp performance degradation. In this paper we aim at achieving a smooth thermal control action, that minimizes the variance of performance tracking error. We formulate this problem as a discrete-time optimal control problem, which can be solved using the theory and computational tools developed in the field of model-predictive control. Our optimization process considers the thermal profile of the system, its evolution over time, and time-varying workload requirements. Experimental results show that the proposed approach offers significant thermal balancing improvements over previous methods.","publicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design","startPage":"711","endPage":"714","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2009.5275073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2009.5275073","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247537/5274921/05275073.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5274921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicore thermal management with model predictive control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275073/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multicore thermal management with model predictive control","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10905288","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5275073/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicore thermal management with model predictive control","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"c2lc39245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045777S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247537","isNumber":"5274921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247537","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5274921","articleId":"5275073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5275099,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Sousa","affiliation":["Integrated Circuit and Systems Group, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Sousa","id":"37273082800"},{"name":"Carla Duarte","affiliation":["Integrated Circuit and Systems Group, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Carla","lastName":"Duarte","id":"38107207100"},{"name":"Manuel Barros","affiliation":["Integrated Circuit and Systems Group, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Barros","id":"37269369400"},{"name":"Jorge Guilherme","affiliation":["Integrated Circuit and Systems Group, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Guilherme","id":"37332129100"},{"name":"Nuno Horta","affiliation":["Integrated Circuit and Systems Group, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Nuno","lastName":"Horta","id":"37269370800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3896-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5275099","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Analog integrated circuits","Design optimization","Kernel","Design automation","Algorithm design and analysis","Fuzzy systems","Genetic algorithms","Genetic mutations","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","circuit optimisation","electronic engineering computing","fuzzy reasoning","genetic algorithms","integrated circuit design","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog IC design optimization kernels","simple fuzzy models","analog integrated circuit design automation","soft computing techniques","analog design knowledge","stochastic optimization kernel","embedded design knowledge model","fuzzy inference algorithm","fuzzy-genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5275099","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2009.5275099","publicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design","abstract":"This paper addresses the analog integrated circuit design automation by proposing an innovative circuit-level optimization kernel.

The invisible watermark is embedded in such a way that the modifications made to the pixel value are perceptually not noticed, and it can be recovered only with an appropriate decoding mechanism.

These DERs are often used as the main components of a CHP-microgrid system and may be called as CHP-based DER. CHP-based DERs can provide power and heat with reliability and quality tailored to the requirements of end-users. As deregulation regime is penetrating more and more into the electricity market, competition among the IPPs is becoming acute. To sustain in this market, cost of electricity generation is to be reduced, not only using modern CHP-based DER technology but also, at the same time, deploying them in the microgrid system as per their type, capacity-size and bus-location. A cost-benefit analysis based method is proposed, in this paper, to enhance the reliability of both 6- and 14-bus meshed as well as radial microgrid networks. In this regard, various costs and benefits relating to CHP-based DER deployment have been taken into account for economic feasibility study. Higher the value of benefit to cost ratio (BCR), than one, better will be the selection of type, capacity-size, and bus-location of CHP-based DERs in respect of utility's benefit. More the Utility's benefit, lesser will be the price of electricity and ultimately, gainer will be the consumers. In this paper, bus-locations have been selected by loss sensitivity analysis and Particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique has been used to maximize BCR.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2009.5275186","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230481/5260217/05275186.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2009.5275186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5260217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strategic deployment of CHP-based distributed energy resources in microgrids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5275186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275186/","displayDocTitle":"Strategic deployment of CHP-based distributed energy resources in microgrids","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10903663","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5275186/","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strategic deployment of CHP-based distributed energy resources in microgrids","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009001554.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068678S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5275186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5275191,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Z.

V2G technology has drawn great interest in the recent years. Success of the sophisticated automatic V2G research depends on efficient scheduling of gridable vehicles in constrained parking lots. Parking lots have constraints of space and current limits for V2G. However, V2G can reduce dependencies on small expensive units in the existing power systems as energy storage that can decrease running costs. It can efficiently manage load fluctuation, peak load; however, it increases spinning reserves and reliability. As number of gridable vehicles in V2G is much higher than small units of existing systems, unit commitment (UC) with V2G is more complex than basic UC for only thermal units. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to solve the V2G, as PSO has been demonstrated to reliably and accurately solve complex constrained optimization problems easily and quickly without any dimension limitation and physical computer memory limit. In the proposed model, binary PSO optimizes the on/off states of power generating units easily. Vehicles are presented by signed integer number instead of 0/1 to reduce the dimension of the problem. Typical discrete version of PSO has less balance between local and global searching abilities to optimize the number of charging/discharging gridable vehicles in the constrained system. In the same model, balanced PSO is proposed to optimize the V2G part in the constrained parking lots. Finally, results show a considerable amount of profit for using proper scheduling of gridable vehicles in constrained parking lots.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5260217","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230481/5260217/05275205.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PES.2009.5275205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2009.5275205","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of vehicle-to-grid scheduling in constrained parking lots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275205/","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of vehicle-to-grid scheduling in constrained parking lots","htmlLink":"/document/5275205/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10903682","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of vehicle-to-grid scheduling in constrained parking lots","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009001517.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089039S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5275205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5275212,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

Through modal observability which is also estimated, the parts of the grid participating in an oscillation mode can be determined. The method is suitable for real-time implementation.

The couplings between the electricity system and the gas system are modeled by so-called energy hubs, which represent the interface between the loads on the one hand and the transmission infrastructures on the other. To increase reliability and efficiency, storage devices are present in the multi-carrier energy system. In order to optimally incorporate these storage devices in the operation of the infrastructure, the capacity constraints and dynamics of these have to be taken into account explicitly. Therefore, we propose a model predictive control approach for controlling the system. This controller takes into account the present constraints and dynamics, and in addition adapts to expected changes of loads and/or energy prices.

Effective forecasting, however, is difficult in view of noisy real-time data gathering and complicated features of load. This paper presents a method based on multilevel wavelet neural networks with novel pre-filtering. The key idea is to use a data pre-filtering method to detect and eliminate spikes within load, apply the wavelet technique to decompose the load into several frequency components, perform appropriate transformation on each component, and feed it together with other appropriate input to a separate neural network. Numerical testing demonstrates the significant value of data pre-filtering and multilevel wavelet neural networks, and shows that our method provides accurate forecasting.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275296/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10903560","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5275296/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Very short-term load forecasting: Multilevel wavelet neural networks with data pre-filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Very short-term load forecasting: Multilevel wavelet neural networks with data pre-filtering","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009001338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077016S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5275296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5275304,"authors":[{"name":"Yige Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5230481/5260217/5275304/5275304-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yige Zhao (B\u2019 07) was born in Liaoning, P.

Accurate forecasting is difficult in view of the complicated effects on load by various factors. In addition, it is difficult to forecast holidays as well as the days before and the days after in view of their particular load patterns and very limited data. In this paper, a multi-level wavelet neural network method is developed to forecast tomorrow's load. To effectively forecast the load for holidays as well as the days before and the days after, a correction coefficient scheme with holiday grouping is developed.

The main purpose of this research work is damping SSR in series compensated transmission lines which are connected to a common bus using a STATCOM. To reach this goal, a control system is proposed and designed for a STATCOM in the transformer bus (or common bus) based on the speed deviation damping signal. In addition to SSR damping, the STATCOM, which is implemented in the transformer bus, can improve voltage stability and dynamical events such as power oscillations and first swing stability. Eigenvalue analyses and nonlinear simulations in PSCAD/EMTDC software are employed to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller and the STATCOM. Simulation results approve the proposed scheme capability in SSR damping at different level of series compensations of the transmission lines.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5275449/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10903226","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sub-synchronous resonance damping in series compensated transmission lines using a statcom in the common bus","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-synchronous resonance damping in series compensated transmission lines using a statcom in the common bus","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009001092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041944S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5275449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5275474,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In this approach, the weights between the layers of neural network have been estimated using the weighted least square state estimation (WLSSE) technique without any iterative approach. The WLSSE technique could offer well established weights by accounting noise associated with the input and output data. This approach is very fast compared to conventional back propagation technique. The proposed method can predict day-ahead loads of the distribution system. The effectiveness of the method is examined on practical NPDCL Warangal, Indian 132/33 kV substation distribution system. The method can provide more accurate results than the back propagation neural networks.

It has always been the essential part of an efficient power system planning and operation. This paper presents a new approach to a multivariate load forecasting by combining support vector regression with a local prediction framework which employs the correlation dimension and mutual information methods used in time-series analysis for data preprocessing. Local prediction uses only a set of K nearest neighbours in the reconstructed embedded space with considering the more relevant historical instances. The performance of the proposed predication model is evaluated on the data used in the EUNITE competition in 2001. The results show that the proposed method provides a relatively better forecasting performance in comparison with the best result found in the competition and other published papers that uses the same competition's data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275587/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10903848","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5275587/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Forecasting electric daily peak load based on local prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forecasting electric daily peak load based on local prediction","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009000876.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075645S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5275587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5275593,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihui Yuan","bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5230481/5260217/5275593/5275593-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhihui Yuan was born in Heilongjiang, China, 1981.

First, a brief review of the grid code requirement on wind turbines to support voltage profile during fault is reviewed. Based on first principles, analytical expressions quantifying the effectiveness and the limits of the voltage support effort are formulated. This has then been extended to include the limits imposed on output current by the transient stability requirements of the wind park, in which stability constrained current limits through the link wind park - the point of the interconnection and the boundary conditions for stable operation have been derived. Using sample computations, the effect of the violation of this stability limit during fault on the wind park has been analyzed. Finally, a control scheme has been proposed, which on the basis of the voltage dip experienced by the network, reduces the real part of the wind park output current with the objective of enhancing the transient stability margin. Again the effectiveness of the proposed scheme has been demonstrated using sample computations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of wind turbine output current during faults on grid voltage and the transient stability of wind parks","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","doi":"10.1109/PES.2009.5275626","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230481/5260217/05275626.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2009.5275626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5260217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5275626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275626/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Effect of wind turbine output current during faults on grid voltage and the transient stability of wind parks","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5275626/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10903886","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of wind turbine output current during faults on grid voltage and the transient stability of wind parks","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009000838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041618S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5275626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":5275648,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Golestani Far","affiliation":["ECE Department, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5230481/5260217/5275648/5275648-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamed Golestani Far (S'06) received the B.

The validity and effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated using the IEEE first benchmark model for computer simulation of subsynchronous resonance by means of time domain simulation analysis using the EMTP-RV program.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5260217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2009.5275666","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230481/5260217/05275666.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/PES.2009.5275666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damping subsynchronous resonance using a STATCOM operating in a phase imbalanced mode","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Damping subsynchronous resonance using a STATCOM operating in a phase imbalanced mode","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5275666/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10903926","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275666/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping subsynchronous resonance using a STATCOM operating in a phase imbalanced mode","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009000749.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060047S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5275666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5275669,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Inserting a DR in an already existing distribution system is an important issue at present, specifically under the deregulated electricity market. Determining the optimal siting and/or sizing of the DR is the key factor in determining the penetration level of the renewable energy sources. Various parameters; like losses, voltage profile, etc were investigated in the previous work. Beside the losses and the voltage profile, the proposed approach introduces another important parameter related to DR installation, which is the short circuit level representing the capacity of the already existing network protective devices. The proposed algorithm uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to determine the appropriate weighting factors of each parameter included in the optimization problem. The selected parameters, i.e., the voltage level, the total system losses and the short circuit level are weighted in order to choose the optimal DR allocation and its corresponding sizing. The proposed technique has been tested on the IEEE 24-bus mesh connected test system. This test system is a large heavily loaded interconnected system. The main advantages of the proposed optimization technique are its simplicity, and applicability to other systems, i.e. radial and interconnected. Simulation results using the MATLAB simulation package are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2009.5275669","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230481/5260217/05275669.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2009.5275669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5260217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum planning of large distributed resources in a mesh connected system based on artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Voltage","Circuit testing","System testing","Electricity supply industry deregulation","Electricity supply industry","Renewable energy resources","Protection","Interconnected systems","Integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","mathematics computing","neural nets","power distribution planning","power engineering computing","power markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large distributed resource planning","mesh connected system","artificial neural network","distribution system","deregulated electricity market","renewable energy source","short circuit level","network protective device capacity","ANN","total system loss","IEEE 24","MATLAB simulation package","bus mesh connected test system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distribution System","Distributed Resource","Artificial Neural Networks","DR Optimal Size","DR Optimal Location","Short Circuit Level","and Loss Reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimum planning of large distributed resources in a mesh connected system based on artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5275669/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10903929","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum planning of large distributed resources in a mesh connected system based on artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009000752.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061856S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5275669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5275673,"authors":[{"name":"A.Y.

The PSO is a relatively new and powerful intelligence evolution method for solving optimization problems. It is a population-based approach. The PSO was inspired from natural behavior of the bees on how they find the location of most flowers. The proposed PSO algorithm is introduced with some modifications such as using an inertia weight that decreases linearly during the simulation. This setting allows the PSO to explore a large area at the start of the simulation. A modification in the number of iterations and the population size is also presented. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed PSO algorithm, comparative studies are conducted on two test distribution systems. The obtained results are compared with those obtained using other approaches in the previous work to examine the performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275673/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5275673/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10903933","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"A modified particle swarm Algorithm for distribution systems reconfiguration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified particle swarm Algorithm for distribution systems reconfiguration","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009000757.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074694S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5275673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5275686,"authors":[{"name":"Hisham Omara","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Hisham Omara received the B.

These include personal computers and most office equipment as well as industrial induction motors driven by variable frequency drives. The increasing importance of these non-conventional loads has an impact which is yet to be quantified and modeled systematically. This is particularly the case with the natural load-side frequency response, and this lack of knowledge compounds with the current uncertainty in the characterization of the load's natural behavior under frequency disturbances. This paper provides a research roadmap to address this question in a rigorous manner. We propose a bottom-up modeling approach which should provide a deeper understanding of this impact and inform on the way power systems operate under a highly nonconventional load mix during transient frequency events.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2009.5275686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2009.5275686","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230481/5260217/05275686.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5260217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A methodology to study the impact of an increasingly nonconventional load mix on primary frequency control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"A methodology to study the impact of an increasingly nonconventional load mix on primary frequency control","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5275686/","accessionNumber":"10903946","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275686/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A methodology to study the impact of an increasingly nonconventional load mix on primary frequency control","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009000735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122661S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5275686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5275688,"authors":[{"name":"Preetika Kulshrestha","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA"],"firstName":"Preetika","lastName":"Kulshrestha","id":"38111165000"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["NCSU, Raleigh, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"38107734700"},{"name":"Mo-Yuen Chow","affiliation":["NCSU, Raleigh, USA"],"firstName":"Mo-Yuen","lastName":"Chow","id":"37270002500"},{"name":"Srdjan Lukic","affiliation":["NCSU, Raleigh, USA"],"firstName":"Srdjan","lastName":"Lukic","id":"37332810700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4241-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-5517"}],"articleNumber":"5275688","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1592},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent systems","Energy management","Smart grids","Hybrid intelligent systems","Intelligent vehicles","Battery powered vehicles","Real time systems","Monitoring","Optimal control","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","power engineering computing","power system management","SCADA systems","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent energy management system simulator","PHEV","plug-in vehicle","municipal parking deck","smart grid environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["batteries","battery chargers","discrete event simulation","energy conservation","energy management","intelligent control","modeling","power distribution control","power systems","SCADA systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5275688","abstract":"There is a need for in-depth study of technologies that will affect the utility industry in a time horizon of less than 20 years.

Initial results suggest that such integration may be of significant value to both researchers and design-engineers alike.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275716/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10903976","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5275716/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An introduction to multiobjective optimisation methods for decentralised power planning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An introduction to multiobjective optimisation methods for decentralised power planning","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009000669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093495S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5275716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5275731,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Future microgrids will likely contain substantial amounts of stochastic generation, which have a more uncertain impact on reliability as compared to dispatchable generation sources. New methods that realistically represent the stochastic behavior of these sources and their impact on reliability need to be developed. This paper proposes a new methodology for assessing local generation adequacy for an islanded microgrid with limited stochastic resources. Instead of modeling the generation and load independently, a combined generation-to-load ratio (GLR) is modeled as a Markov process, thereby preserving the correlation among disperse photovoltaic installations and the load. Historical data on solar irradiation and electric load are scaled and smoothed to account for their spatial distribution and used to estimate the Markov transition rates and the final reliability indices. The process illustrates the impact of stochastic behavior on reliability in a transparent manner and is useful for evaluating the reliability benefits of load curtailment and increasing local generation capacity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2009.5275731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5260217","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230481/5260217/05275731.pdf","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability evaluation of islanded microgrids with stochastic distributed generation","doi":"10.1109/PES.2009.5275731","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5275731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reliability evaluation of islanded microgrids with stochastic distributed generation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275731/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10903990","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5275731/","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability evaluation of islanded microgrids with stochastic distributed generation","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009000645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5275731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5275748,"authors":[{"name":"H.

These networks are protected by very simple protection devices such as over-current relays, fuses, and re-closers. Recent trends in distributed generation (DG) and its useful advantages perfectly can be achieved while the relevant concerns are deliberately taken into account. For example, penetration of DG disturbs the radial nature of conventional distribution networks. Therefore, protection coordination will be changed in some cases, and in some other cases it will be lost. The penetration of DG into distribution networks reinforces the necessity of designing new protection systems for these networks. One of the main capabilities that can improve the efficiency of new protection relays in distribution systems is exact fault locating. In this paper, a novel fault location and protection scheme has been presented to provide the distribution networks with DG. The suggested approach is able to determine the accurate type and location of faults using MLP neural networks. As case study, the proposed scheme has been assessed using a MATLAB based developed software and DIgSILENT Power Factory 13.2 on a sample distribution network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275863/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10903416","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5275863/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A fault location and protection scheme for distribution systems in presence of dg using MLP neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fault location and protection scheme for distribution systems in presence of dg using MLP neural networks","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009000454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080987S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5275863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5275866,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengyou He","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China","Cornell University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Zhengyou He, received the PH.D. degree in electrical engineering at Southwest Jiaotong University, in Mar. 2001.

For double line outage detection, there are two key issues which must be addressed: identification of equivalent outages and reduction of the event search space. The existence of indistinguishable outages due to incomplete PMU deployment is proved and a method of recognizing these indistinguishable outages is presented. In addition, methods for reducing the size of the multiple line outage event space are discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230481/5260217/05275906.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","doi":"10.1109/PES.2009.5275906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2009.5275906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5260217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5275906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double line outage detection using phasor angle measurements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Goniometers","Event detection","Phasor measurement units","Phase detection","Phase measurement","Power measurement","Load flow","Electric variables measurement","Power grids","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","phase measurement","power system faults","power system measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double line outage detection","phasor angle measurements","pre-outage topology information","real-time phase angle measurements","event search space reduction","equivalent outage identification","PMU deployment","multiple line outage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275906/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Double line outage detection using phasor angle measurements","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5275906/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10903458","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double line outage detection using phasor angle measurements","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009000361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065418S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5275906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5275913,"authors":[{"name":"Dorel Soares Ramos","affiliation":["Department of Electric Energy and Automation Engineering, Escola Polit\u00e9cnica, Universidade de S\u00e1o Paulo, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Dorel Soares Ramos (B.Sc. 1975, M.Sc. 1988, D.Sc. 1996) was born in Sao Paulo, on May 2, 1951.

Such information is used for the purposes of both planning and organizing of auctions. It is of Independent Power Producers' great interest to reduce the existent information asymmetry, deliberately created by the auctioneer to encourage competition in the auctions. Knowing the incentives driving Discos in their energy requirements declarations, it is possible to build an optimization model that emulates Discos' behavior when deciding those declarations. Besides, with the usage of public information of auction outcomes, it seems possible to get closer to Discos' private information using some ldquoreverse engineeringrdquo.

It utilizes an extensible architecture that allows the user to easily add new variables, constraints and costs to the standard OPF problem formulation while preserving the structure needed to use pre-compiled solvers. A software object is used to encapsulate the definition of the problem formulation, manage the corresponding named sets of variables, constraints and costs, and handle all of the tedious index maintenance tasks. The software design has the advantage of minimizing the coupling between variables, constraints and costs, making it possible, for example, to add variables to an existing model without having to explicitly modify existing constraints or costs to accommodate them. The example of adding joint co-optimization of reserves to the OPF, based on fixed zonal reserve requirements, is used to illustrate the capabilities of MATPOWER's extensible OPF architecture.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2009.5275967","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230481/5260217/05275967.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2009.5275967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5260217","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MATPOWER's extensible optimal power flow architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5275967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MATPOWER's extensible optimal power flow architecture","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275967/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10904011","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5275967/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MATPOWER's extensible optimal power flow architecture","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009000224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062231S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5275967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5275974,"authors":[{"name":"Aimin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Aimin Li Male, was born in Zhangjiakou Hebei province in china, on July 5, 1981.

As a VSC can instantaneously change output voltage waveform, power sharing in a microgrid is possible by controlling the output voltage angle of the DGs through droop. The angle droop is able to provide proper load sharing among the DGs without a significant steady state frequency drop in the system. It is shown that the frequency variation with the frequency droop controller is significantly higher than that with the angle droop controller. The angle droop controller is derived from DC load flow. Both the angle and frequency droop controllers are designed through eigenvalue analysis. The performance of these two controllers is then performed through PSCAD simulations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2009.5275987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5260217","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230481/5260217/05275987.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Angle droop versus frequency droop in a voltage source converter based autonomous microgrid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5275987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5275987/","displayDocTitle":"Angle droop versus frequency droop in a voltage source converter based autonomous microgrid","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10904031","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Angle droop versus frequency droop in a voltage source converter based autonomous microgrid","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009000196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046488S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5275987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5276013,"authors":[{"name":"Masatake Kawada","affiliation":["Institute of Technology and Science, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Masatake Kawada received his Dr. Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 1998.

In such systems, chillers are independent of each other to provide standby capacity, operational flexibility, and less disruption maintenance. However, the problem of efficiently managing multiple-chiller systems is complex in many respects. In particular, the electrical energy consumption in the chiller plant markedly increases if the chillers are managed improperly, therefore significant energy savings can be achieved by optimizing the chiller operation of HVAC systems. In this paper an unified method for multi-chiller management optimization is presented, that deals simultaneously with the optimal chiller loading and optimal chiller sequencing problems. The main objective is that of reducing both power consumption and operative costs. The approach is based on a cooling load estimation algorithm, and the optimization step is performed by means of a multi-phase genetic algorithm, that provides an efficient and suitable approach to solve this kind of complex multi-objective optimization problem. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by resorting to a dynamic simulation environment developed in Matlab/Simulink, where the plant dynamics are accurately described. It is shown that the proposed algorithm gives superior performance with respect to standard approaches, in terms of energy performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5276131/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10904098","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5276131/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A multi-phase genetic algorithm for the efficient management of multi-chiller systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-phase genetic algorithm for the efficient management of multi-chiller systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062741S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5256114","isNumber":"5276086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5256114","xplore-issue":"5276086","articleId":"5276131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asian Control Association","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5276132,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Especially, RFID and printed electronics using the principle of roll-to-roll manufacturing to build equipment at high speeds will have a big impact on the printed electronics and publishing industries. In order to increase the precision and flexible ability to detect effectively the external and internal disturbance, several controller designs for roll-to-roll web control system are proposed in recent years. However, almost proposals are employed for the time-invariant linear SISO systems. In reality, some terms in several control systems such as roll-to-roll web system change in time and are non-linear. Therefore, classical gain tuning approaches are not suitable. In this paper, an algorithm proposed for non-linear roll-to-roll web control system is based on using the modified genetic algorithm to determine the optimal parameters of controller, detect the errors and automatically recover the errors at every time interval. The simulation results in Matlab/Simulink employed firstly with the simple plants and after that with back-stepping controllers of roll-to-roll system prove the stability and reliability of the proposed approach.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5256114/5276086/05276132.pdf","startPage":"1691","endPage":"1696","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th Asian Control Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 7th Asian Control Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A control system design of automatically tuning controller for roll to roll web system using the modified genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5276132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A control system design of automatically tuning controller for roll to roll web system using the modified genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10926975","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5276132/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A control system design of automatically tuning controller for roll to roll web system using the modified genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087936S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5256114","isNumber":"5276086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5256114","xplore-issue":"5276086","articleId":"5276132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asian Control Association","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5276174,"authors":[{"name":"Honggui Han","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Honggui","lastName":"Han","id":"37534590300"},{"name":"Junfei Qiao","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Junfei","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37273179900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-956056-2-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-956056-9-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5276174","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5276174","abstract":"Rapid, accurate and reliable measurements of biological oxygen demand (BOD) are a key basis for monitoring and controlling wastewater treatment processes (WWTP).

Its output is used as an error signal by an on-line learning algorithm to update the parameters of the neuro-fuzzy controller. In this way the latter is able to gradually replace the conventional controller from the control of the system. The proposed learning algorithm makes direct use of the variable structure systems theory and establishes a sliding motion in terms of the neuro-fuzzy controller parameters, leading the learning error toward zero.

The cellular neural network (CNN) technology and the CNN Universal machines (CNN-UM) with the physical parallel computing architecture have been researched and developed making new ways for solving several types of partial differential equations. This paper introduces the application CNN in solving Saint venant equation 2D and has 5 parts: Introduction; Part 2 gives theoretical background about CNN and CNN 2D, 3D models; Part 3 analyzes and designs the problem following the CNN model with detail specifications; Part 4 identifies the boundary and initial conditions, then sets up a simulation on Matlab tools. The last gives the conclusion and evaluates the results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5276317/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10904259","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5276317/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Solving two -dimensional Saint venant equation by using cellular neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving two -dimensional Saint venant equation by using cellular neural network","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059214S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5256114","isNumber":"5276086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5256114","xplore-issue":"5276086","articleId":"5276317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asian Control Association","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5276336,"authors":[{"name":"Qingshan She","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qingshan","lastName":"She","id":"37543063400"},{"name":"Zhizeng Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhizeng","lastName":"Luo","id":"37279737700"},{"name":"Yaping Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yaping","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37676849800"},{"name":"Hongbo Zou","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Control, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hongbo","lastName":"Zou","id":"37577699100"},{"name":"Yun Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Control, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Chen","id":"38107961600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-956056-2-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-956056-9-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5276336","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Image coding","Discrete cosine transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Transform coding","Automation","Image sampling","Reconstruction algorithms","Monitoring","Discrete transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","image reconstruction","image representation","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial adaptive image reconstruction","compressive sensing theory","sparse representation","discrete cosine transform","DCT","bi-orthogonal wavelet transform"]}],"abstract":"Compressive sensing (CS) is an emerging model-based framework for signal recovery at a rate significantly below the Nyquist sampling rate. The CS theory states that a signal having a sparse representation in some bases can be reconstructed from a small set of random projections. In this paper, a reconstruction method is developed based on block CS and adaptive choice of frame expansions according to spatial features of partitioned regions. Natural image is divided into different types of regions, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is used for smooth regions, while the bi-orthogonal wavelet transform (OWT) is chosen for uneven regions. Several experiments are conducted on benchmark images to verify the efficacy of the proposed method. Experimental results show that it achieves improved quality in both subjective and objective measurement as compared with existing methods.","publicationTitle":"2009 7th Asian Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th Asian Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5256114/5276086/05276336.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276086","startPage":"1570","endPage":"1575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially adaptive image reconstruction via compressive sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5276336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatially adaptive image reconstruction via compressive sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5276336/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10904278","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5276336/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially adaptive image reconstruction via compressive sensing","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069204S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5256114","isNumber":"5276086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5256114","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5276086","articleId":"5276336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asian Control Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5276371,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Feng Juang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Feng","lastName":"Juang","id":"37271874000"},{"name":"Yang-Yin Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yang-Yin","lastName":"Lin","id":"37598448200"},{"name":"I-Fang Chung","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Informatics, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"I-Fang","lastName":"Chung","id":"37334087000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-956056-2-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-956056-9-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5276371","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5276371","abstract":"This paper proposes an interval type-2 recurrent fuzzy neural network (IT2RFNN) for dynamic system identification.

By repeatedly showing a neural network inputs classified into groups, the network can be trained to discern the criteria used to classify, and it can do so in a generalized manner allowing successful classification of new inputs not used during training. With the explosion of research in emotion in recent year, the application of pattern recognition technology to emotion detection has become increasingly interesting. Since emotion has become an important interface for the communication between human and machine, it plays a basic role in rational decision-making, learning, perception, and various cognitive tasks. Human's emotion can be detected based on the physiological measurements, facial expression and vocal recognition. Since human shows the same facial muscles when expressing a particular emotion, therefore the emotion can be quantified. In this study, six primary emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise were classified using Neural Network. Real dataset of facial expression images were captured and processed to prepare for Neural Network training and testing. The dataset was tested on Multilayer Layer Perceptron with Backpropagation learning algorithm and Regression analysis. The experimental results reveal that Neural Network has a misclassification rate of 2.5% while Regression analysis yields a misclassification rate of 33.33%.","doi":"10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276419","pdfPath":"/iel5/5256112/5276414/05276419.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Computing & Informatics","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Computing & Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emotion classification using neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5276419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Emotion classification using neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10975416","publicationDate":"June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/5276419/","conferenceDate":"6-8 June 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emotion classification using neural network","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056522S","chronDate":"6-8 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"5256112","isNumber":"5276414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5256112","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5276414","articleId":"5276419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5276440,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Teo","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Research Group, School ofEngineering and Information Technology, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Teo","id":"37312201700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0219-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0220-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5710"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5729"}],"articleNumber":"5276440","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic mutations","Genetic algorithms","Evolutionary computation","Encoding","Testing","Biological cells","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational efficiency","Artificial intelligence","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","self-adjusting systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-adaptive mutation operator","evolutionary search","real-coded genetic algorithms","evolutionary computation","self-organization process","real-coded evolutionary algorithm","generalized generation gap algorithm","multimodal optimization problems","unimodal optimization problems","evolutionary optimization process"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5276440","abstract":"Self-adaptation in evolutionary computation refers to the encoding of parameters into the chromosome to allow for the self-organization process to act on the parameters in addition to the design variables.

G3 is currently one of the most efficient as well as effective state-of-the-art real-coded genetic algorithms (RCGAs) but the drawback is that its performance on multimodal optimization problems is known to be poor compared to unimodal optimization problems. In this research, our objective is to introduce a self-adaptive mutation operator into G3, of which the mutation decision parameter is evolved along with the search variables during the evolutionary optimization process. The proposed algorithm is tested using four well-known multimodal benchmark test problems with many local optima surrounding their global optimum.

Modeling is the most important aspect in the animation development whereby articulated figure is commonly used in modeling the human or animal model. Kinematics technique is the common approach for control movement in animation. In this study, forward kinematics technique is applied into human animation and the defined angles are trained into neural network. The purpose of using neural network is to get the precise coordinate for ldquoend effectorrdquo. The angles of the output are then applied to the model to produce human walking. This technique overcomes the problem of ldquotry and errorrdquo in forward kinematics technique in order to get the target coordinate for human walking. This study is able to overcome the deficiency in forward kinematics.

As a result, Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLD) based methods suffers due to singularity problem (of scatter matrix). This situation is often referred as \"small sample size\" (SSS) problem. Moreover, FLD is a linear algorithm by nature. Hence, it fails to extract important information from nonlinear and complex data such as face image. To remedy this problem, this paper presents a new face recognition approach by integrating discrete cosine transform (DCT) and kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (KFDA). The DCT has the capability to compact the energy in an image and let the dimensionality of the input sample space to be reduced. Then, KFDA, a new variant of FLD, will be used to extract the most discriminating feature. This is performed by transforming the reduced DCT subset using a nonlinear kernel function to a high dimensional nonlinear feature space and then followed by the FLD step. Based on the extensive experiments performed on ORL database, the highest recognition accuracy of 95.375% is achieved with only 24 features.","doi":"10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276535","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Computing & Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Computing & Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5256112/5276414/05276535.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition using integrated Discrete Cosine Transform and Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5276535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5276535/","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition using integrated Discrete Cosine Transform and Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"10975525","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5276535/","conferenceDate":"6-8 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition using integrated Discrete Cosine Transform and Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050713S","chronDate":"6-8 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"5256112","isNumber":"5276414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5256112","xplore-issue":"5276414","articleId":"5276535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5276543,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is important to focus on an efficient solution to avoid crosstalk, which is routing the traffic through an N times N optical network to avoid coupling two signals within each SE. Optimal routing in OON is an NP-hard problem. Many heuristic algorithms were designed by many researchers to perform this routing. Routing the messages in degree-decreasing of the message conflicts gave best performance among them. When Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm was used to solve the problem, it gave good results. It is a good idea to use these two algorithms to improve the performance. This paper presents an Improved SA (ISA) for message routing in OON that combines SA algorithm with the best heuristic algorithms. Simulation Results show that the proposed ISA can be a competitive choice for solving the crosstalk problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276543","pdfPath":"/iel5/5256112/5276414/05276543.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Computing & Informatics","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Computing & Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved Simulated Annealing algorithm to avoid crosstalk in Optical Omega Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5276543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"An improved Simulated Annealing algorithm to avoid crosstalk in Optical Omega Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10975451","publicationDate":"June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/5276543/","conferenceDate":"6-8 June 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved Simulated Annealing algorithm to avoid crosstalk in Optical Omega Network","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065505S","chronDate":"6-8 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"5256112","isNumber":"5276414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5256112","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5276414","articleId":"5276543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5276547,"authors":[{"name":"Zainal Ahmad","affiliation":["School of Chemical Engineering, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Nibong Tebal, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zainal","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37339684400"},{"name":"Jie Zhang","affiliation":["School of Chemical Engineering and Advanced Materials, University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37337399900"},{"name":"Syamsul Rizal Abd Syukor","affiliation":["School of Chemical Engineering, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Engineering Campus, Seri Ampangan, 14300, Nibong Tebal, Seberang Perai Selatan, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Syamsul Rizal Abd","lastName":"Syukor","id":"37087767731"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0219-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0220-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5710"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5729"}],"articleNumber":"5276547","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Robustness","Training data","Tellurium","Electronic mail","Testing","Diversity reception","Continuous-stirred tank reactor"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical engineering computing","chemical reactors","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","tanks (containers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi step-ahead model prediction","multiple neural network generalisation","forward selection technique","neural network bootstrap training","irreversible exothermic reaction","CSTR","continuous stirred tank reactor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5276547","abstract":"Currently, combining multiple neural networks appears to be a very promising approach in improving neural network generalisation since it is very difficult, if not impossible, to develop a perfect single neural network.

Instead of combining all the developed networks, this paper proposes selective combination techniques: forward selection.

The proposed techniques are applied to modelling irreversible exothermic reaction in CSTR.

Existing online scaling techniques suffer from long redistribution times as well as negative impacts on application performance. By leveraging our insight into a reordering window, this paper presents ALV, a new data redistribution approach to RAID-5 scaling. The reordering window is a result of the natural space hole as data being redistributed, and it grows in size. The data inside the reordering window can migrate in any order without overwriting other in-use data chunks. The ALV approach exploits three novel techniques. First, ALV changes the movement order of data chunks to access multiple successive chunks via a single I/O. Second, ALV updates mapping metadata lazily to minimize the number of metadata writes while ensuring data consistency. Third, ALV uses an on/off logical valve to adaptively adjust the redistribution rate depending on application workload. We implemented ALV in Linux Kernel 2.6.18 and evaluated its performance by replaying three real-system traces: TPC-C, Cello-99, and SPC-Web. The results demonstrated that ALV outperformed the conventional approach consistently by 53.31-73.91 percent in user response time and by 24.07-29.27 percent in redistribution time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ALV: A New Data Redistribution Approach to RAID-5 Scaling","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2009.150","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5398795/05276795.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2009.150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5398795","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5276795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5276795/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"ALV: A New Data Redistribution Approach to RAID-5 Scaling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5276795/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11147918","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ALV: A New Data Redistribution Approach to RAID-5 Scaling","sourcePdf":"ttc2010030345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062997S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5398795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5398795","articleId":"5276795","onlineDate":"02 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":5276797,"authors":[{"name":"Mike Wasikowski","affiliation":["US Army Training and Doctrine Command Analysis Center, Fort Leavenworth, KS, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5550977/5276797/5276797-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mike Wasikowski received the BS degree in computer science, math, and psychology from Truman State University in 2007, and the MS degree from the University of Kansas in 2009.

Researchers have rigorously studied the resampling, algorithms, and feature selection approaches to this problem. No systematic studies have been conducted to understand how well these methods combat the class imbalance problem and which of these methods best manage the different challenges posed by imbalanced data sets. In particular, feature selection has rarely been studied outside of text classification problems. Additionally, no studies have looked at the additional problem of learning from small samples. This paper presents a first systematic comparison of the three types of methods developed for imbalanced data classification problems and of seven feature selection metrics evaluated on small sample data sets from different applications. We evaluated the performance of these metrics using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) and area under the precision-recall curve (PRC). We compared each metric on the average performance across all problems and on the likelihood of a metric yielding the best performance on a specific problem. We examined the performance of these metrics inside each problem domain. Finally, we evaluated the efficacy of these metrics to see which perform best across algorithms. Our results showed that signal-to-noise correlation coefficient (S2N) and Feature Assessment by Sliding Thresholds (FAST) are great candidates for feature selection in most applications, especially when selecting very small numbers of features.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Training data","Machine learning algorithms","Text categorization","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Accuracy","Partial response channels","Performance evaluation","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","sampling methods","sensitivity analysis","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning","classifier suboptimal performance","text classification","metric performance evaluation","receiver operating characteristic","precision recall curve","signal to noise correlation coefficient","small sample class imbalance problem","feature selection metrics","imbalanced data classification","feature assessment by sliding thresholds"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class imbalance problem","feature evaluation and selection","machine learning","pattern recognition","bioinformatics","text mining."]}],"doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2009.187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5550977/05276797.pdf","startPage":"1388","endPage":"1400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550977","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2009.187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combating the Small Sample Class Imbalance Problem Using Feature Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5276797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Combating the Small Sample Class Imbalance Problem Using Feature Selection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5276797/","volume":"22","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5276797/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11476833","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combating the Small Sample Class Imbalance Problem Using Feature Selection","sourcePdf":"ttk2010101388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092044S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5550977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"225","xplore-issue":"5550977","articleId":"5276797","onlineDate":"02 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":5276799,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Eid","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, South Valley University, Aswan, Egypt","University of Texas, Tyler, Tyler, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5361446/5276799/5276799-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmad Eid (S'06) was born in Qena, Egypt.

A fully controlled active power filter is designed to regulate the load terminal voltage, eliminate harmonics, correct supply power factor, and minimize the effect of unbalanced loads. The control algorithm for the active power filter (APF) is based on the perfect harmonic cancellation method which provides a three-phase reference supply current in phase with its positive-sequence fundamental voltage. The proposed APF is integrated into the model of a 90-kVA advanced aircraft electric power system under VSCF operation. The performance characteristics of the system are studied with the frequency of the generator's output voltage varied from 400 Hz to 800 Hz under different loading conditions. Several case studies are presented including dc loads as well as passive and dynamic ac loads.

This paper represents a new telecom power system using local microsources (fuel cell and microturbine). Some benefits of this system are effectively eliminating batteries, diesel generator, and automatic transfer switch. In this study, a new multiple input buck-boost converter is utilized as an interface between the microsources and the dc bus. The peak current-mode control is used to control the current of fuel cell while the voltage-mode control is used to regulate the output voltage. A model for the proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEM FC) and microturbine (MT) along with their subcomponents and internal controls are presented. Furthermore, the parallel operation of FC and MT by using the proposed multiple-input dc/dc converter is investigated. In addition, the dynamic response of the system to the dynamic behavior of the load is analyzed. Using an inverter, the common bus of the system also connected to the distribution network in order to supply the excess power to the grid. For grid interconnection, an LC filter, double-tuned filters, and a C-type high-pass filter are developed for eliminating high-frequency switching oscillations, selected harmonics, and high-order harmonics, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2031490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5570058/05276800.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2031490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5570058","startPage":"2633","endPage":"2645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grid Interaction Operation of a Telecommunications Power System With a Novel Topology for Multiple-Input Buck-Boost Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5276800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Grid Interaction Operation of a Telecommunications Power System With a Novel Topology for Multiple-Input Buck-Boost Converter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5276800/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11534299","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5276800/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grid Interaction Operation of a Telecommunications Power System With a Novel Topology for Multiple-Input Buck-Boost Converter","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-onar-2031490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078524S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5570058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5570058","articleId":"5276800","onlineDate":"02 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5276801,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Munoz-Organero","affiliation":["Carlos III Technical University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Mario Mu\u00f1oz-Organero (M'08) received the M.Sc. degree in telecommunications engineering from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain, in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications engineering from the Carlos III University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 2004.","He is an Associate Professor of Telematics Engineering at the Carlos III University of Madrid.

An analysis shows a relation between parasitic junction capacitors and substrate resistance for low insertion loss (IL). The power-handling capability of the switch was also investigated through the voltage dividing mechanism through the substrate in the case of an ON-insertion loss-state NMOS switch implemented in a triple-well structure. A multistacked field-effect transistor (FET) structure with feed-forward capacitors in an Rx switch was chosen as the method of designing an antenna switch with high power-handling capability. Low IL of the switch in the multistacked FET structure is achieved by the optimization of layout and minimization of junction capacitors through the deep \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n-well bias.

Intentional unequal division of the voltage swing level at each NMOS device by feed-forward capacitors with negative biases of the off-state switches helps to prevent channel formation in the off-state device.

Larger arrays are designed by using the knowledge of the mutual admittances between the elements of smaller arrays.

The proposed antenna has been successfully simulated, fabricated, and measured. Effects of the key parameters on the frequency ranges of the notched bands are also investigated. The measured impedance bandwidth defined by VS WR < 2 of 10.1 GHz (2.9-13 GHz), with the triple notched bands of 3.3-3.9, 5.2-5.35, and 5.8-6.0 GHz, is obtained. Measured group delay and transmission characteristics indicate that the antenna has good transient response.

It represents a unified concept that can be used for different types of data such as audio, speech signals, images or video. Time-frequency analysis is employed for speech signals, while space/spatial-frequency analysis is used for images. Their combination is applied for video signals. Particularly, we focus on the 2-D case: space/spatial-frequency based image watermarking procedure that will be subsequently extended to video signal. A method that selects coefficients for watermarking by estimating the local frequency content is proposed. In order to provide watermark imperceptibility, the nonstationary filtering is used to model the watermark which corresponds to the host signal components. Furthermore, the watermark detection within the multidimensional time-frequency domain is proposed. The efficiency and robustness of the procedure in the presence of various attacks is proven experimentally.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2033624","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5415751/05276828.pdf","startPage":"736","endPage":"745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2033624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Application of Multidimensional Time-Frequency Analysis as a Base for the Unified Watermarking Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5276828","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5276828/","displayDocTitle":"An Application of Multidimensional Time-Frequency Analysis as a Base for the Unified Watermarking Approach","volume":"19","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11149635","pubMedId":"20172773","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5276828/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Application of Multidimensional Time-Frequency Analysis as a Base for the Unified Watermarking Approach","sourcePdf":"19tip02-iorovic-2033624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107885S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5415751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5415751","articleId":"5276828","onlineDate":"02 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5276840,"authors":[{"name":"Artyom M.

The reference analog system is therefore typically represented by a set of blocks that are connected with each other through electrical ports, and usually exhibits a nonlinear behavior. It therefore seems quite natural to consider Nonlinear Wave Digital modeling as a solid approach for the rapid prototyping of such systems. In this paper, we discuss how nonlinear wave digital modeling can be fruitfully used for this purpose, with particular reference to special blocks and connectors that allow us to overcome the implementational difficulties and potential limitations of such solutions. In particular, we address some issues that are typical of VA and physical modeling, concerning how to accommodate special blocks into WD structures, how to enable the interaction between different WD structures, and how to accommodate structural and topological changes on the fly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5276845/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","volume":"18","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11228823","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5276845/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Analog Modeling in the Wave-Digital Domain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual Analog Modeling in the Wave-Digital Domain","sourcePdf":"tasl-desanctis-2033637.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081564S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5446581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5446581","articleId":"5276845","onlineDate":"02 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5276851,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Ortega","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Escola Universit\u00e0ria Salesiana de Sarri\u00e0, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5463268/5276851/5276851-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Carlos Ortega (S'05\u2013M'08) received the B.Eng. degree in electronics engineering from the Escola Universit\u00e0ria Salesiana de Sarri\u00e0 (EUSS), Barcelona, Spain, in 1998 and the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees from the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, in 2003 and 2008, respectively.","From 1998 to 2001, he was with the Technology Transfer Department, EUSS, where he has been a Lecturer in electrical and electronic engineering since 2002 with the Electronics Engineering Department.

This paper investigates the use of MC input voltages with different amplitudes in order to reduce the inherent torque ripple that appears when direct torque control (DTC) is used to drive ac machines, particularly permanent-magnet synchronous motors, as its stator inductance is typically half of that of an induction machine of similar ratings. Utilizing a wider range of input voltage vectors for the MC, but not using the rotating vectors, a new lookup table that distinguishes between small and large torque errors is developed, leading to an enhanced MC-fed DTC. The enhancement enables a reduction in the electromagnetic torque ripple and output-current total harmonic distortion. Furthermore, the proposed control strategy improves the MC voltage transfer ratio up to 86.6% compared with 50% achieved by the conventional DTC using MCs at the expense, however, of slightly decreasing the input power factor control capability. The proposed enhanced MC DTC was tested experimentally, and results comparing its performance with MC DTC using an adapted lookup table are shown.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5276851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5276851/","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11286138","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improved Waveform Quality in the Direct Torque Control of Matrix-Converter-Fed PMSM Drives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Waveform Quality in the Direct Torque Control of Matrix-Converter-Fed PMSM Drives","sourcePdf":"tie-ortega-2033084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155063S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5463268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"5463268","articleId":"5276851","onlineDate":"02 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":5276856,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Farrier","affiliation":["Rad-icon Imaging, DALSA Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5290333/5276856/5276856-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Farrier (M'79) received the B.A. degree in physics and the M.S. degree in engineering science from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1975 and 1977, respectively.","He was engaged in research on Schottky junction detectors and quantum electronics with the University of California.

microwave observations. In an effort to address this objective, an airborne instrument, the passive/active L-band sensor (PALS), was flown over two watersheds as part of the cloud and land surface interaction campaign (CLASIC) conducted in Oklahoma in 2007. Eleven flights were conducted over each watershed during the field campaign. Extensive ground observations (soil moisture, soil temperature, and vegetation) were made concurrent with the PALS measurements. Extremely wet conditions were encountered. As expected from previous research, the radiometer-based retrievals were better than the radar retrievals. The standard error of estimates (SEEs) of the retrieved soil moisture using only the PALS radiometer data were 0.048 m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n/m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n for Fort Cobb (FC) and 0.067 m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n/m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n for the Little Washita (LW) watershed.

Quality-assessment indexes, like Q4, spectral angle mapper, and relative global synthesis error, require a reference image at the same resolution as the fused image. In the absence of such a reference image, the quality of pansharpening is assessed at a degraded resolution only. The recently proposed index of Quality Not requiring a Reference (QNR) is one among very few tools available for assessing the quality of pansharpened images at the desired high resolution. However, it would be desirable to cross the outcomes of several independent quality-assessment indexes, in order to better determine the quality of pansharpened images. In this paper, we propose a method to assess fusion quality at the highest resolution, without requiring a high-resolution reference image. The novel method makes use of digital filters matching the modulation transfer functions (MTFs) of the imaging-instrument channels. Spectral quality is evaluated according to Wald's spectral consistency property. Spatial quality measures interscale changes by matching spatial details, extracted from the multispectral bands and from the panchromatic image by means of the high-pass complement of MTF filters. Eventually, we highlight the necessary and sufficient condition criteria for quality-assessment indexes by developing a pansharpening method optimizing the QNR spatial index and assessing the quality of fused images by using the proposed protocol.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2029094","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5291960/05276868.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2029094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291960","startPage":"3880","endPage":"3891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pansharpening Quality Assessment Using the Modulation Transfer Functions of Instruments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5276868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pansharpening Quality Assessment Using the Modulation Transfer Functions of Instruments","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5276868/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"47","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10940730","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5276868/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pansharpening Quality Assessment Using the Modulation Transfer Functions of Instruments","sourcePdf":"tgrs-khan-2029094.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076454S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5291960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"5291960","articleId":"5276868","onlineDate":"02 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5276869,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Myung Woo","affiliation":["NSI-NCRC, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5290333/5276869/5276869-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun-Myung Woo was born in Korea in 1980.

Then, the fitness functions are instrumented in the right position by analyzing the pre-dominator tree (PreDT), and two metrics are developed to prioritize the CBs. Coverage-Table is established to record the CBs information and keeps track of whether a branch is executed or not. GA is used to generate test data to cover CBs so as to cover all the branches. The comparison results show that this approach is more efficient than random testing approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICASID.2009.5276897","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247340/5276889/05276897.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"310","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Anti-counterfeiting, Security, and Identification in Communication","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Anti-counterfeiting, Security, and Identification in Communication","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASID.2009.5276897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new method of test data generation for branch coverage in software testing based on EPDG and Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5276897/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new method of test data generation for branch coverage in software testing based on EPDG and Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10906165","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5276897/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new method of test data generation for branch coverage in software testing based on EPDG and Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Hong Kong","sourcePdf":"072ANewMethodofTestDataGenerationforBranchCoverage.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075747S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247340","isNumber":"5276889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247340","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5276889","articleId":"5276897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5276912,"authors":[{"name":"Yanfeng Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, North-China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yanfeng Jiang","id":"37310043600"},{"name":"Jiaxin Ju","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, North-China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jiaxin Ju","id":"37576861300"},{"name":"Xiaobo Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, North-China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaobo Zhang","id":"37310015000"},{"name":"Bing Yang","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, North-China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Bing Yang","id":"37306996400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3883-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3884-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5048"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5056"}],"articleNumber":"5276912","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":410},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analog circuits","Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Wheels","Circuit synthesis","Genetic mutations","Evolution (biology)","Character generation","Microelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","genetic algorithms","network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated analog circuit design","genetic algorithm","circuits synthesis","optimization algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automated Control","Analog Circuit","Genetic Algorithm(GA)"]}],"abstract":"Analog circuits synthesis is very challenging.

An effective solution to securing communications over open networks is to apply cryptography. Encryptions, digital signatures, password-based user authentication, are some of the most basic cryptographic techniques for securing communications. But, however, for many ldquofancierrdquo applications, the basic cryptographic techniques are no longer adequate. Hence, the need of the hour is an efficient but simple, encryption and decryption algorithm for encrypting any kind of data. Also, the keys required for encryption and decryption must be randomized and randomly generated from the changing data bits. Our newly proposed algorithm humbly tries to satisfy the above two criteria to some extent.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A randomized cryptographic algorithm and its simulation in C and MATLAB with its hardware implementation in Verilog HDL","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Anti-counterfeiting, Security, and Identification in Communication","doi":"10.1109/ICASID.2009.5276954","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Anti-counterfeiting, Security, and Identification in Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247340/5276889/05276954.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASID.2009.5276954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276889","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5276954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5276954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A randomized cryptographic algorithm and its simulation in C and MATLAB with its hardware implementation in Verilog HDL","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5276954/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906152","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A randomized cryptographic algorithm and its simulation in C and MATLAB with its hardware implementation in Verilog HDL","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"082Arandomizedcryptographicalgorithmanditssimulati.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075825S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247340","isNumber":"5276889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247340","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5276889","articleId":"5276954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5276990,"authors":[{"name":"Gaoqi Wei","affiliation":["The Key Laboratory of Information and Computing Science of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Normal University, Guiyang, China"],"firstName":"Gaoqi","lastName":"Wei","id":"37881363200"},{"name":"Xiaoyao Xie","affiliation":["The Key Laboratory of Information and Computing Science of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Normal University, Guiyang, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyao","lastName":"Xie","id":"37400127100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3883-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3884-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5048"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5056"}],"articleNumber":"5276990","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Optimization methods","Space technology","Biology computing","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Algorithm design and analysis","Evolution (biology)","Iterative algorithms","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","shortest path","Darwin genetic selection","natural selection organic evolution process","biological genetics","survival of the fittest natural law","survival+examination iterative process searching algorithm","global optimization searching algorithm","parallel processing","C++ language","TSP question test experiment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithm","selection","crossover","mutation","Genetic Algorithm of Improvement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5276990","abstract":"The genetic algorithm is a computation model that simulates Darwin's genetic selection and the natural selection organic evolution process.

By such a technique, the output voltage of the selected pixel is as a voltage bias to control the frequency of the oscillator. As a result, the oscillation frequency is a function of the photocurrent. A n-bit counter is adopted to count the output frequency signal and converts it into the digital domain, by which the conventional array-ADC structure is not required and a lot of chip area is saved due to removing ADC. Furthermore, this counter can also function as a CDS circuit. The noise of the proposed architecture is low due to a equivalent bandpass filter is achieved by using the counter and the CDS technique. Additionally, the operation speed of the counter can be extremely fast because the frequency of the VCO could be pushed up to several hundreds MHz or even higher.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Anti-counterfeiting, Security, and Identification in Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247340/5276889/05277019.pdf","startPage":"624","endPage":"627","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Anti-counterfeiting, Security, and Identification in Communication","doi":"10.1109/ICASID.2009.5277019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASID.2009.5277019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276889","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low noise CMOS image sensor read-out circuit based on VCO and frequency counter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit noise","CMOS image sensors","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Frequency","Counting circuits","Low-frequency noise","Photodiodes","Active noise reduction","CMOS technology","Photoconductivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","readout electronics","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise CMOS image sensor read-out circuit","VCO","frequency counter","output voltage","n-bit counter","CDS circuit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A low noise CMOS image sensor read-out circuit based on VCO and frequency counter","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277019/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906158","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low noise CMOS image sensor read-out circuit based on VCO and frequency counter","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"149ALowNoiseCMOSImageSensorReadoutCircuitBasedonVC.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090364S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247340","isNumber":"5276889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247340","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5276889","articleId":"5277019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5277027,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyi Hu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China","Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication, Ministry of Education, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyi","lastName":"Hu","id":"37406698400"},{"name":"Ru Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China","Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication, Ministry of Education, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Ru","lastName":"Xu","id":"37392566100"},{"name":"Deqing Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication, Ministry of Education, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Deqing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405348600"},{"name":"Wei Wei","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China","Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication, Ministry of Education, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wei","id":"38083866800"},{"name":"Hui Fang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China","Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication, Ministry of Education, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Fang","id":"37893480800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3883-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3884-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5048"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5056"}],"articleNumber":"5277027","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"abstract":"According to the feature of underwater acoustic channel (UWA), the implementation of time and frequency synchronization is introduced.

A femtocell is an indoor base station using wide area network (WAN) radio access technology, such as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). These data access points are deployed in a residential or small business unit building. Voice and data communications are relayed back and forth utilizing cellular technology (2G/3G/WiMAX) with IP backhaul through the customer's broadband connection such as digital subscriber line (DSL), cable modem or a separate radio frequency (RF) backhaul channel. Personal cell towers at every home may appear like an enthralling scene. However, some critical issues must be resolved before the mass deployment of femtocells becomes possible. The global market has advanced a lot in the field of wireless communication with the advent of technologies like 3G, WiMAX and now even 4G. However, these technologies becoming popular amongst the mass is a phenomenon concentrated only in some parts of the world. For instance, the mass in developing countries like India is still using 2G and concepts like 3G and Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) services have just arrived in the wireless communication panorama. This paper finds out the challenges in the technical and commercial aspects of femtocells for facilitation of the mass deployment of femtocells in the global scenario, in general, and the present Indian market scenario, in particular. Moreover, future prospects of femtocells are analyzed and possible research directions are recommended for the successful implementation of femtocells as home base stations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Anti-counterfeiting, Security, and Identification in Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247340/5276889/05277035.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"37","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Anti-counterfeiting, Security, and Identification in Communication","doi":"10.1109/ICASID.2009.5277035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASID.2009.5277035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276889","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtocell mass deployment: Indian perspective","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wide area networks","WiMAX","DSL","Radio frequency","Wireless communication","Femtocell networks","3G mobile communication","Business","Data communication","Digital relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","indoor radio","picocellular radio","wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocell mass deployment","indoor base station","wide area network radio access technology","Universal Mobile Telecommunications System","voice communication","data communication","cellular technology","IP backhaul","customer broadband connection","personal cell towers","wireless communication","Indian market scenario"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Femtocell mass deployment: Indian perspective","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277035/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10949967","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtocell mass deployment: Indian perspective","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"009FemtocellMassDeploymentIndianPerspective.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044905S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247340","isNumber":"5276889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247340","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5276889","articleId":"5277035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5277039,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Fang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Ministry of Education, Marine Information Technology, Xiamen, China"],"lastName":"Hui Fang","id":"37893480800"},{"name":"Xiaoyi Hu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Ministry of Education, Marine Information Technology, Xiamen, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoyi Hu","id":"37406698400"},{"name":"Ru Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Ministry of Education, Marine Information Technology, Xiamen, China"],"lastName":"Ru Xu","id":"37392566100"},{"name":"Fang Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Ministry of Education, Marine Information Technology, Xiamen, China"],"lastName":"Fang Xu","id":"37401235400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3883-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3884-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5048"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5056"}],"articleNumber":"5277039","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","Interferometry","Underwater acoustics","Underwater communication","OFDM","Multiaccess communication","Laboratories","Information technology","Diversity reception","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic wave interferometry","code division multiple access","diversity reception","spread spectrum communication","underwater acoustic communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MC-CDMA","carrier interferometry codes","underwater acoustic channel","diversity gain","user capacity","spread spectrum gain","system efficiency","diversity combining scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CI/MC-CDMA","Carrier interferometry codes","Diversity gain","spreading gain","UWA channel"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a basic MC-CMDA. via carrier interferometry Codes (CI codes) in an Underwater Acoustic(UWA) Channel.

Particle swarm optimization with turbulence has demonstrated to be a good alternative by taking into account the velocity of convergence to better solution and the total optimization time in generating dynamical models to the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277133","startPage":"344","endPage":"349","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276875","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247842/5276875/05277133.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle swarm optimization with turbulence (PSOT) applied to thermal-vacuum modelling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277133/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization with turbulence (PSOT) applied to thermal-vacuum modelling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277133/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10905520","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization with turbulence (PSOT) applied to thermal-vacuum modelling","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p344.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059006S","chronDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247842","isNumber":"5276875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247842","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5276875","articleId":"5277133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5277163,"authors":[{"name":"Hwa Chang Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hwa Chang","lastName":"Sung","id":"37289593400"},{"name":"Jin Bae Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin Bae","lastName":"Park","id":"37281003900"},{"name":"Jong Seon Kim","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Kunsan National University, Kunsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong Seon","lastName":"Kim","id":"38259569000"},{"name":"Young Hoon Joo","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Kunsan National University, Kunsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young Hoon","lastName":"Joo","id":"37288371200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3596-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3597-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7584"}],"articleNumber":"5277163","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Uncertainty","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy systems","Linear matrix inequalities","State estimation","Approximation methods","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","convex programming","feedback","fuzzy control","linear matrix inequalities","minimisation","nonlinear control systems","observers","sampled data systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["output-feedback sampled-data control","parametric uncertain nonlinear system","intelligent digital re-design","fuzzy observer","state-matching","convex minimization problem","linear matrix inequality","state estimation","inverse-bilinear approximation method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277163","abstract":"In this paper, we concern an intelligent digital re-design (IDR) method for a fuzzy observer-based output-feedback control system which includes parametric uncertainties.

For example, by BLAST-ing the genes of the human genome (around 30,000 genes) we obtain a 30,000 by 30,000 distance matrix. This matrix can not be currently stored in the memory of a typical desktop PC. In the same time, clustering the resulting matrix using a fuzzy relational clustering algorithm such as Non-Euclidean Fuzzy C-means (NERFCM) requires prior knowledge of the number of clusters existent in the data set. The question is, how can we evaluate the number of clusters if we can't even load the matrix in the memory our PC? To address this problem, we propose to extend the correlation cluster validity (CCV) that we introduced in a previous paper, denoting the new validity measure as eCCV. eCCV consists of two steps: first sampling of the large matrix followed by the estimation of the number of cluster employing CCV of the sampled data. The sampling strategy produces also a significant processing speedup. We illustrate eCCV properties on a large synthetic dataset and on a large subset of human genes obtained from the RefSeq database.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277214","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247842/5276875/05277214.pdf","startPage":"1003","endPage":"1008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276875","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"eCCV: A new fuzzy cluster validity measure for large relational bioinformatics datasets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277214/","displayDocTitle":"eCCV: A new fuzzy cluster validity measure for large relational bioinformatics datasets","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277214/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10905688","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"eCCV: A new fuzzy cluster validity measure for large relational bioinformatics datasets","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056483S","chronDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247842","isNumber":"5276875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247842","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5276875","articleId":"5277214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5277220,"authors":[{"name":"Yalong Zhang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Fukui, Japan"],"firstName":"Yalong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38107115200"},{"name":"Xuan Ma","affiliation":["Faculty of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Ma","id":"38106770900"},{"name":"Jousuke Kuroiwa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Fukui, Japan"],"firstName":"Jousuke","lastName":"Kuroiwa","id":"37304172200"},{"name":"Tomohiro Odaka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Fukui, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Odaka","id":"37304172100"},{"name":"Hisakazu Ogura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Fukui, Japan"],"firstName":"Hisakazu","lastName":"Ogura","id":"37307991500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3596-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3597-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7584"}],"articleNumber":"5277220","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277220","abstract":"Many unsatisfied solutions being produced in applying GA to solve the constrained combinatorial optimization problems due to genetic operations.

The results on eleven benchmark problems are very encouraging.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277240","startPage":"2077","endPage":"2082","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247842/5276875/05277240.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic system identification using recurrent neural network with multi-valued connection weight","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System identification","Recurrent neural networks","Neurons","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Neurofeedback","Backpropagation algorithms","Nonlinear systems","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic system identification","recurrent neural network","multivalued connection weight","backpropagation learning algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic system identification using recurrent neural network with multi-valued connection weight","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277240/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10905713","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic system identification using recurrent neural network with multi-valued connection weight","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04608S","chronDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247842","isNumber":"5276875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247842","xplore-issue":"5276875","articleId":"5277240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5277250,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Hau Roger Jeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Hau Roger","lastName":"Jeng","id":"37602713100"},{"name":"Chi-Yuan Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Yuan","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37419516500"},{"name":"Shie-Jue Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shie-Jue","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281134100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3596-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3597-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7584"}],"articleNumber":"5277250","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":489},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Function approximation","Fuzzy sets","Parameter estimation","Takagi-Sugeno-Kang model","Fuzzy logic","Least squares methods","Clustering algorithms","Particle swarm optimization","Least squares approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["function approximation","fuzzy logic","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy reasoning","fuzzy set theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","least squares approximations","mathematics computing","parameter estimation","particle swarm optimisation","pattern clustering","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["function approximation","HLA","hybrid learning algorithm","GT2FNN","general type-2 fuzzy neural network","Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type fuzzy neural network","fuzzy set theory","fuzzy logic system","type reduction","structure identification","parameter identification","similarity-based fuzzy clustering","linear least squares regression","PSO","particle swarm optimization","RLS","recursive least squares estimator","fuzzy rule"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277250","abstract":"A novel Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type fuzzy neural network which uses general type-2 fuzzy sets in a type-2 fuzzy logic system, called general type-2 fuzzy neural network (GT2FNN), is proposed for function approximation.

An efficient strategy is proposed by using alpha-cuts to decompose a general type-2 fuzzy set into several interval type-2 fuzzy sets to solve the type reduction problem. Incremental similarity-based fuzzy clustering and linear least squares regression are combined to solve the structure identification problem.

This research area is often referred to as multiobjective genetic fuzzy systems where EMO algorithms are used to search for a number of non-dominated fuzzy rule-based systems with respect to their accuracy and interpretability. The main advantage of the use of EMO algorithms for fuzzy system design over single-objective optimizers is that multiple alternative fuzzy rule-based systems with different accuracy-interpretability tradeoffs are obtained by their single run. The decision maker can choose a single fuzzy rule-based system according to their preference. There still exist several important issues to be discussed in this research area such as the definition of interpretability, the formulation of interpretability measures, the visualization of tradeoff relations, and the interpretability of the explanation of fuzzy reasoning results. In this paper, we discuss the ability of EMO algorithms as multiobjective optimizers to search for Pareto optimal or near Pareto optimal fuzzy rule-based systems. More specifically, we examine whether EMO algorithms can find non-dominated fuzzy rule-based systems that approximate the entire Pareto fronts of multiobjective fuzzy system design problems.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277370","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247842/5276875/05277370.pdf","startPage":"1724","endPage":"1729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Search ability of evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms for multiobjective fuzzy genetics-based machine learning","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10905669","htmlLink":"/document/5277370/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Search ability of evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms for multiobjective fuzzy genetics-based machine learning","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1724.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055178S","chronDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247842","isNumber":"5276875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247842","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5276875","articleId":"5277370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5277390,"authors":[{"name":"Yoichiro Maeda","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligent Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoichiro","lastName":"Maeda","id":"37276979800"},{"name":"Yusuke Kajihara","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligent Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Kajihara","id":"38100819300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3596-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3597-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7584"}],"articleNumber":"5277390","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Art","Music","Human computer interaction","Chaos","Computer graphics","Atmosphere","Performance evaluation","Rhythm","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["art","computer graphics","genetic algorithms","interactive systems","music"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic twelve tone row generation method","musical composition","genetic algorithm","computer graphics","computer music","sound generation process","fitness function","consonance interval","dissonant interval","interactive art"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277390","abstract":"Recently, researches on interactive art regarding computer graphics and computer music are actively performed. In the computer music, genetic algorithm (GA) and interactive genetic algorithm (IGA) are usually used for the sound generation process, but it is difficult to just handle these methods directly for the music composition. In this research we propose a music composition system based on twelve-tone technique that is a music composition technique of the contemporary music. Because it is a technique to compose the music step by step, the Twelve-tone Technique has an advantage that it is suitable for the composition of computer music. Making of twelve-tone rows which is the first process of the twelve-tone technique is an important process to determine the subject and atmosphere of music. However, it is difficult for a human without the knowledge of music to evaluate twelve-tone rows. In this paper, we design the fitness function based on the relation between the consonance interval and dissonant interval that are a part of general musical theory and perform the automatic generation of twelve-tone row by searching the consonance tone row with GA. We confirmed the effectiveness of this system by constructing the simulator that generates twelve-tone rows and executing the comparison questionnaire of twelve-tone rows made by the simulator and humans.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277390","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247842/5276875/05277390.pdf","startPage":"963","endPage":"968","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic generation method of twelve tone row for musical composition used genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Automatic generation method of twelve tone row for musical composition used genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10905787","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5277390/","conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic generation method of twelve tone row for musical composition used genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p963.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046889S","chronDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247842","isNumber":"5276875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247842","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5276875","articleId":"5277390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5277391,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Chin Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Chin","lastName":"Lai","id":"37307619400"},{"name":"Cheng-Chih Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National University of Tainan, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Chih","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37536094000"},{"name":"Shing-Tai Pan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shing-Tai","lastName":"Pan","id":"37528598600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3596-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3597-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7584"}],"articleNumber":"5277391","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Discrete wavelet transforms","Signal processing algorithms","Robustness","Discrete cosine transforms","Singular value decomposition","Protection","Data mining","Computational efficiency","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["micro-genetic algorithm","image watermarking","singular value decomposition","cover image","visual artifact","signal processing attack"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277391","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce an image watermarking scheme using singular value decomposition (SVD) and improved micro-genetic algorithm (micro-GA).

The influence of each parameters affected to efficiency is investigated through the main effect and interaction analysis. Sequential neural network process models are constructed to characterize the entire 3-step process. In the sequential scheme, each work cell sub-process is modeled individually, and each sub-process model is linked to previous sub-process outputs and subsequent sub-process inputs. These neural network models are used for process optimization using both genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization to maximize cell efficiency. The optimized efficiency found via particle swarm optimization showed better performance than optimized efficiency found via genetic algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277392/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10905789","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277392/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A comparison and analysis of genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization using neural network models for high efficiency solar cell fabrication processes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison and analysis of genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization using neural network models for high efficiency solar cell fabrication processes","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"5277392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062875S","chronDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247842","isNumber":"5276875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247842","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5276875","articleId":"5277392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5277397,"authors":[{"name":"Enrique Onieva","affiliation":["Industrial Computer Science Department, Instituto de Autom\u00e1tica Industrial (CSIC), Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Onieva","id":"37396455100"},{"name":"Javier Alonso","affiliation":["Industrial Computer Science Department, Instituto de Autom\u00e1tica Industrial (CSIC), Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Alonso","id":"37554305200"},{"name":"Joshue Perez","affiliation":["Industrial Computer Science Department, Instituto de Autom\u00e1tica Industrial (CSIC), Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Joshue","lastName":"Perez","id":"37400302800"},{"name":"Vicente Milanes","affiliation":["Industrial Computer Science Department, Instituto de Autom\u00e1tica Industrial (CSIC), Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Vicente","lastName":"Milanes","id":"37568845900"},{"name":"Teresa de Pedro","affiliation":["Industrial Computer Science Department, Instituto de Autom\u00e1tica Industrial (CSIC), Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Teresa","lastName":"de Pedro","id":"37284709800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3596-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3597-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7584"}],"articleNumber":"5277397","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":374},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Genetic algorithms","Automatic control","Intelligent transportation systems","Wheels","Humans","Cognition","Uncertainty","Vehicles","Surface fitting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","iterative methods","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous car fuzzy control","iterative genetic algorithms","soft computing","intelligent transportation systems","unmanned control","steering wheel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277397","abstract":"The techniques of soft computing are recognized as having a strong learning and cognition capability as well as good tolerance to uncertainty and imprecision.

The unmanned control of the steering wheel is one of the most important challenges faced by researchers in this area. This paper presents a method of automatically adjusting a fuzzy controller to manage the steering wheel of a mass-produced vehicle. Information about the state of the car while a human driver is handling it is captured and used to search, via genetic algorithms, for the best fit of an appropriate fuzzy controller. Evaluation of the fuzzy controller will take into account its adjustment to the human driver's actions and the absence of abrupt changes in its control surface, so that not only is the route tracking good, but the drive is smooth and comfortable for the vehicle's occupants.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277397","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247842/5276875/05277397.pdf","startPage":"1615","endPage":"1620","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous car fuzzy control modeled by iterative genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous car fuzzy control modeled by iterative genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10905794","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5277397/","conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous car fuzzy control modeled by iterative genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1615.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093649S","chronDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247842","isNumber":"5276875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247842","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5276875","articleId":"5277397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5277409,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio H.

To address this issue, a hyperparameter evolutionary optimization (HPEO) framework was previously devised, initially using a genetic algorithm to tune external PRS parameters in a modular fashion, decoupled from its internal components. To further improve the effectiveness of HPEO and improve the diversity of the hyperparameter solutions found, this paper presents an extension that realizes cross-generation learning with an adaptive history network (AHN), which promotes exploring new regions in the search space while avoiding regions that have been searched extensively. The proposed approach, termed HPEO-AHN, is particularly suitable for tuning powerful but complex PRSs such as neuro-fuzzy systems (NFS). Preliminary experiments with two state-of-the-art NFSs optimized using the new approach have shown encouraging results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277420/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10905817","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277420/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An adaptive history network method to improve the genetic optimization of pattern recognition systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive history network method to improve the genetic optimization of pattern recognition systems","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069114S","chronDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247842","isNumber":"5276875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247842","xplore-issue":"5276875","articleId":"5277420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5277428,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Ying Sun","affiliation":["National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Ying","lastName":"Sun","id":"37307916800"},{"name":"Ming-Chin Yang","affiliation":["National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Chin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37713588500"},{"name":"Shang-Jeng Tsai","affiliation":["National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shang-Jeng","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37537801400"},{"name":"Jyun-Sian He","affiliation":["National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jyun-Sian","lastName":"He","id":"38006564300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3596-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3597-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7584"}],"articleNumber":"5277428","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved flush material belt weigh feeder system via fuzzy logic controller and adaptive neural networks","abstract":"The Flush Material Belt Weigh Feeder (FMBWF) has used in many material handling plants. The stability and the performance of the layer control system will affect the quality of the production. In general, the behavior of the flush material on the BWF is non-linear, time-lag, and disturbance character. The layer of the flush material on the belt is hard to be stably controlled especially the occurrence of unstable situation in flush material or the pre-feeder feeding rate and the variation of the set point value of the FMBWF. This paper focuses on the performance improvement of the FMBWF via adopted a fuzzy controller under the situation of the Flow Rate Set Value (FRSV) variation. The proposed fuzzy controller is utilized instead of the original feed forward compensation function to deal with the problems of the temporary unstable situation. This paper offers the simulation result comparison of the set point value variations between the BWF for the original and the proposed control system. The simulation results are distinct better than the original control system. The influence of the variations of the set point value can be successfully evaluated by the Fuzzy controller and adjusted the Proportional Actuator immediately. Finally the proposed control system remains convergence with smooth and stable. Therefore, the accuracy, stability and the performance of the control system are improved.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277428","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","startPage":"1259","endPage":"1263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276875","pdfPath":"/iel5/5247842/5276875/05277428.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Belts","Fuzzy logic","Control systems","Adaptive systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Neural networks","Fuzzy control","Stability","Fuzzy sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","belts","compensation","feedforward","fuzzy control","materials handling equipment","quality control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flush material belt weigh feeder system","fuzzy logic controller","adaptive neural network","production quality","disturbance character","nonlinear time-lag","flow rate set value variation","feed forward compensation function","temporary unstable situation","proportional actuator","stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An improved flush material belt weigh feeder system via fuzzy logic controller and adaptive neural networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277428/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277428/","accessionNumber":"10905825","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved flush material belt weigh feeder system via fuzzy logic controller and adaptive neural networks","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079726S","chronDate":"20-24 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5247842","isNumber":"5276875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5247842","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5276875","articleId":"5277428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5277440,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Bae Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5395745/5277440/5277440-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jong-Bae Park (M'98) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1987, 1989, and 1998, respectively.","For 1989\u20131998, he was with Korea Electric Power Corporation, and for 1998\u20132001, he was an Assistant Professor at Anyang University, Anyang, Korea.

Although the particle swarm optimization (PSO) approaches have several advantages suitable to heavily constrained nonconvex optimization problems, they still can have the drawbacks such as local optimal trapping due to premature convergence (i.e., exploration problem), insufficient capability to find nearby extreme points (i.e., exploitation problem), and lack of efficient mechanism to treat the constraints (i.e., constraint handling problem). This paper proposes an improved PSO framework employing chaotic sequences combined with the conventional linearly decreasing inertia weights and adopting a crossover operation scheme to increase both exploration and exploitation capability of the PSO. In addition, an effective constraint handling framework is employed for considering equality and inequality constraints. The proposed IPSO is applied to three different nonconvex ED problems with valve-point effects, prohibited operating zones with ramp rate limits as well as transmission network losses, and multi-fuels with valve-point effects. Additionally, it is applied to the large-scale power system of Korea. Also, the results are compared with those of the state-of-the-art methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277440/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11087709","htmlLink":"/document/5277440/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Particle Swarm Optimization for Nonconvex Economic Dispatch Problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Particle Swarm Optimization for Nonconvex Economic Dispatch Problems","sourcePdf":"25tpwrs01-jpark-2030293.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170379S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5395745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"390","xplore-issue":"5395745","articleId":"5277440","onlineDate":"02 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5277454,"authors":[{"name":"David Lopez-Perez","affiliation":["University of Bedfordshire, UK"],"bio":{"p":["David L\u00d3pez-P\u00c9rez (david.lopez@beds.ac.uk) received his Bachelor and Master degrees in telecommunication from Miguel Hernandez University, Elche, Spain, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

Some of the techniques and concepts used in the SCA may be foreign to a communications engineer, and can result in confusion and long learning curves. The understanding of these concepts is of great relevance for communications engineers independent of any opinion about the SCA itself. This tutorial is aimed at educating communication engineers on these software engineering principles and describing how the SCA applies them to achieve its goals. We describe the different interfaces of the SCA that provide a framework for the implementation of SDR. The tutorial provides introductory material to understand the basic operation of the SCA as implemented in the Open-Source SCA Implementation::Embedded developed by Wireless @ Virginia Tech.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding the software communications architecture","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2009.5277455","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5277441/05277455.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2009.5277455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277441","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277455/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2009","displayDocTitle":"Understanding the software communications architecture","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5277455/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","publicationDate":"September 2009","accessionNumber":"10917969","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the software communications architecture","sourcePdf":"014AGUAYO-GONZALEZ LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036784S","chronDate":"September  2009","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5277441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5277441","articleId":"5277455","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5277456,"authors":[{"name":"Hyungsik Ju","affiliation":["Yonsei University, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Hyungsik Ju (jugun@yonsei.ac.kr) is a Ph.D. student at Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.

They are typically deployed indoors to improve coverage and provide excellent user experience, including high data rates. Cellular operators benefit from reduced infrastructure and operational expenses for capacity upgrades and coverage improvements. Femtocells also bring unique challenges, such as unplanned deployment, user installation, restricted access, and interoperability with existing handsets and network infrastructure. Although femtocells may cause some interference to other users in the network, with the use of proper interference management techniques, this can be well controlled. We present interference management techniques for both downlink and uplink of femtocells operating based on 3GPP Release 7 standards (also known as HSPA+). Femtocell carrier selection and femtocell DL Tx power self-calibration are proposed as key interference management methods for downlink. For uplink interference management, adaptive attenuation at the femtocell and limiting the Tx power of the femtocell users are proposed. Different interference models and their analysis are presented. In addition, coverage performance and capacity results are presented to quantify the benefits of femtocells. We demonstrate that in addition to coverage enhancements, significant capacity improvements are achieved on both downlink and uplink when femtocells are deployed in 3G UMTS/HSPA+ networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference management and performance analysis of UMTS/HSPA+ femtocells","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2009.5277462","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5277441/05277462.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2009.5277462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277441","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277462/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2009","displayDocTitle":"Interference management and performance analysis of UMTS/HSPA+ femtocells","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5277462/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","publicationDate":"September 2009","accessionNumber":"10917975","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference management and performance analysis of UMTS/HSPA+ femtocells","sourcePdf":"021YAVUZ LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059029S","chronDate":"September  2009","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5277441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"191","xplore-issue":"5277441","articleId":"5277462","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5277463,"authors":[{"name":"Luis G.

Finally, the issue of LTE physical cell identity confusion associated with inbound handover to femtocells (which is expected to be resolved within the 3GPP Release 9 timeline) is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2009.5277464","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5277441/05277464.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2009.5277464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtocell access control strategy in UMTS and LTE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277464/","displayDocTitle":"Femtocell access control strategy in UMTS and LTE","volume":"47","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2009","accessionNumber":"10917963","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277464/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtocell access control strategy in UMTS and LTE","sourcePdf":"023PATANAPONGPIBUL LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046838S","chronDate":"September  2009","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5277441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"5277441","articleId":"5277464","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5277465,"authors":[{"name":"George Korinthios","affiliation":["COSMOTE \u2014 Mobile Communications S.A., Romania"],"bio":{"p":["George Korinthios graduated from the Physics Department of the University of Athens (UoA) in 1994.

We also compare with the performance obtained when no dictionary is used to constrain the recognition results.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2009.8","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5277471/5277472/05277516.pdf","startPage":"808","endPage":"812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2009.8","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Recognition of Handwritten Numerical Fields in a Large Single-Writer Historical Collection","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277516/","conferenceDate":"26-29 July 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10904580","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277516/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of Handwritten Numerical Fields in a Large Single-Writer Historical Collection","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3725a808.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051685S","chronDate":"26-29 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5277471","isNumber":"5277472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5277471","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5277472","articleId":"5277516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5277517,"authors":[{"name":"Qiu-Feng Wang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiu-Feng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37596995600"},{"name":"Fei Yin","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Yin","id":"37588585200"},{"name":"Cheng-Lin Liu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cheng-Lin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280620800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4500-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3725-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-5363"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-2140"}],"articleNumber":"5277517","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Natural languages","Text recognition","Character recognition","Image segmentation","Character generation","Lattices","Handwriting recognition","Pattern recognition","Dynamic programming","Text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","handwritten character recognition","image recognition","image segmentation","natural languages","search problems","statistical analysis","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical language model","handwritten Chinese text recognition","text line image","character segmentation candidate","word segmentation candidate","character recognition score","pruned dynamic programming search method","character-based n-gram","word-based n-gram","hybrid n-gram model","HIT-HW database"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a system for handwritten Chinese text recognition integrating language model.

In this paper, we propose to further boost the recognition rate by incorporating a distortion model that artificially generates a huge number of virtual training samples from existing ones. We achieve a record high recognition rate of 99.46% on the ETL-9B database. Traditionally, when the dimension of the feature vector is high and the number of training samples is not sufficient, the remedies are to (i) regularize the class covariance matrices in the discriminant functions, (ii) employ Fisher's dimension reduction technique to reduce the feature dimension, and (iii) generate a huge number of virtual training samples from existing ones. The second contribution of this paper is the investigation of the relative effectiveness of these three methods for boosting the recognition rate.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2009.48","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5277471/5277472/05277523.pdf","startPage":"1026","endPage":"1030","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2009.48","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of Handwritten Chinese Characters by Combining Regularization, Fisher's Discriminant and Distorted Sample Generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Recognition of Handwritten Chinese Characters by Combining Regularization, Fisher's Discriminant and Distorted Sample Generation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5277523/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10904587","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277523/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of Handwritten Chinese Characters by Combining Regularization, Fisher's Discriminant and Distorted Sample Generation","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3725b026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075802S","chronDate":"26-29 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5277471","isNumber":"5277472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5277471","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5277472","articleId":"5277523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5277527,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Costa e Silva","affiliation":["University of Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Ana Costa e","lastName":"Silva","id":"38259235000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4500-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3725-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-5363"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-2140"}],"articleNumber":"5277527","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Text analysis","Classification tree analysis","Decision trees","Graphical models","Usability","Entropy","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","probability","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov model","document analysis application","text table location","HMM","probabilistic graphical model","interdependent classification","document structure finder","transition probability","knowledge axiom","emission energy","learning algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hidden markov Models (HMM)","graphical models","table location"]}],"abstract":"hidden Markov models (HMM) are probabilistic graphical models for interdependent classification.

This paper applies error-correcting output coding (ECOC) to the CNN for segmentation-free OCR such that: 1) the CNN target outputs are designed according to code words of length N; 2) the minimum Hamming distance of the code words is designed to be as large as possible given N. ECOC provides the CNN with the ability to reject or correct output errors to reduce character insertions and substitutions in the recognized text. Also, using code words instead of letter images as the CNN target outputs makes it possible to construct an OCR for a new language without designing the letter images as the target outputs. Experiments on the recognition of English letters, 10 digits, and some special characters show the effectiveness of ECOC in reducing insertions and substitutions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolutional codes","Neural networks","Optical character recognition software","Optical computing","Optical fiber networks","Character recognition","Cellular neural networks","Error correction codes","Hamming distance","Target recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","image classification","image coding","neural nets","optical character recognition","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECOC","error-correcting output coding","CNN","convolutional neural network","segmentation-free OCR","optical character recognition","visual classification task","minimum Hamming distance","text recognition","code word"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pattern recognition","neural networks","error correcting coding","optical character recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277584","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2009.144","startPage":"581","endPage":"585","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5277471/5277472/05277584.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2009.144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277584/","displayDocTitle":"Error-Correcting Output Coding for the Convolutional Neural Network for Optical Character Recognition","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 July 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10904648","htmlLink":"/document/5277584/","conferenceDate":"26-29 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-Correcting Output Coding for the Convolutional Neural Network for Optical Character Recognition","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3725a581.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050582S","chronDate":"26-29 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5277471","isNumber":"5277472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5277471","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5277472","articleId":"5277584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5277592,"authors":[{"name":"Hidetoshi Miyao","affiliation":["Shinshu University, Nagano, Japan"],"firstName":"Hidetoshi","lastName":"Miyao","id":"37270977100"},{"name":"Minoru Maruyama","affiliation":["Shinshu University, Nagano, Japan"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Maruyama","id":"37274551000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4500-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3725-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-5363"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-2140"}],"articleNumber":"5277592","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"abstract":"For an online handwriting recognition system equipped with a writer-independent classifier to progressively improve the recognition performance for a specific writer with an increase in his/her handwriting inputs, the following method is proposed: (1) for a handwriting pattern that causes a recognition error, a two-class classifier of the corresponding class is (re)constructed as a part of a writer-dependent classifier, separately from the writer-independent one, where artificially generated examples are used to compensate for lack of training examples.

As a result, an average recognition rate of 98.07% was obtained by the exclusive use of the writer-independent classifier.

Our aim is to address a methodology which is segmentation-free since in many cases of historical documents, the segmentation process does not produce meaningful results due to unconstraint layout, several degradations or typesetting imperfections. The proposed method is based on block-based document image descriptors that are used at a template matching process satisfying invariance in terms of translation, rotation and scaling. Improvement in terms of time expense is obtained by applying the matching process only on salient regions of the image. Experimental results on a database with representative historical printed documents prove the efficiency of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2009.236","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5277471/5277472/05277703.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2009.236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277472","startPage":"271","endPage":"275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation-free Word Spotting in Historical Printed Documents","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation-free Word Spotting in Historical Printed Documents","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277703/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10904741","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5277703/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation-free Word Spotting in Historical Printed Documents","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3725a271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048502S","chronDate":"26-29 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5277471","isNumber":"5277472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5277471","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5277472","articleId":"5277703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5277744,"authors":[{"name":"Zhixin Shi","affiliation":["Center of Unified Biometrics and Sensors Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Zhixin","lastName":"Shi","id":"37278372500"},{"name":"Srirangaraj Setlur","affiliation":["Center of Unified Biometrics and Sensors Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Srirangaraj","lastName":"Setlur","id":"37725931200"},{"name":"Venu Govindaraju","affiliation":["Center of Unified Biometrics and Sensors Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Venu","lastName":"Govindaraju","id":"37276543300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4500-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3725-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-5363"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-2140"}],"articleNumber":"5277744","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":70,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":404},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partitioning algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Handwriting recognition","Strips","Text recognition","Adaptive filters","Text analysis","Venus","Biometrics","Biosensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document image processing","handwriting recognition","image classification","image segmentation","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten Arabic text line extraction","steerable directional local profile technique","handwritten Arabic document","generalized adaptive local connectivity map","steerable directional filter","adaptive thresholding algorithm","connected component analysis","text classification","document image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["andwritten text line extraction","Arabic document","OCR"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a new text line extraction method for handwritten Arabic documents. The proposed technique is based on a generalized adaptive local connectivity map (ALCM) using a steerable directional filter. The algorithm is designed to solve the particularly complex problems seen in handwritten documents such as fluctuating, touching or crossing text lines. The proposed algorithm consists of three steps. Firstly, a steerable filter is used to probe and determine foreground intensity along multiple directions at each pixel while generating the ALCM. The ALCM is then binarized using an adaptive thresholding algorithm to get a rough estimate of the location of the text lines. In the second step, connected component analysis is used to classify text and non text patterns in the generated ALCM to refine the location of the text lines. Finally, the text lines are separated by superimposing the text line patterns in the ALCM on the original document image and extracting the connected components covered by the pattern mask. Analysis of experimental results on the DARPA MADCAT Arabic handwritten document data indicate that the method is robust and is capable of correctly isolating handwritten text lines even on challenging document images.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2009.79","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5277471/5277472/05277744.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2009.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Steerable Directional Local Profile Technique for Extraction of Handwritten Arabic Text Lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277744/","displayDocTitle":"A Steerable Directional Local Profile Technique for Extraction of Handwritten Arabic Text Lines","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10904772","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277744/","conferenceDate":"26-29 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Steerable Directional Local Profile Technique for Extraction of Handwritten Arabic Text Lines","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3725a176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075161S","chronDate":"26-29 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5277471","isNumber":"5277472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5277471","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5277472","articleId":"5277744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5277761,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Galbally","affiliation":["Biometric Recognition Group-ATVS, EPS, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Galbally","id":"37540649500"},{"name":"Julian Fierrez","affiliation":["Biometric Recognition Group-ATVS, EPS, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Fierrez","id":"37392738600"},{"name":"Marcos Martinez-Diaz","affiliation":["Biometric Recognition Group-ATVS, EPS, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Marcos","lastName":"Martinez-Diaz","id":"38270520900"},{"name":"Javier Ortega-Garcia","affiliation":["Biometric Recognition Group-ATVS, EPS, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Ortega-Garcia","id":"38274484600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4500-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3725-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-5363"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-2140"}],"articleNumber":"5277761","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"abstract":"A brute force attack using synthetically generated handwritten signatures is performed against a HMM-based signature recognition system.

We compare the performance of the proposed approach with that of a generative baseline on a challenging real-world dataset of customer letters. When the kernel used by the classifier is linear, the performance improvement is marginal but the proposed system is approximately 15 times faster than the baseline. If we use a non-linear kernel devised for this task, we obtain a 15% relative reduction of the error but the detector is approximately 15 times slower.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2009.16","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5277471/5277472/05277774.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2009.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fisher Kernels for Handwritten Word-spotting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277774/","displayDocTitle":"Fisher Kernels for Handwritten Word-spotting","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10904793","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277774/","conferenceDate":"26-29 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fisher Kernels for Handwritten Word-spotting","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3725a106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075536S","chronDate":"26-29 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5277471","isNumber":"5277472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5277471","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5277472","articleId":"5277774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5277779,"authors":[{"name":"Basilis Gatos","affiliation":["Computational Intelligence Laboratory, Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications, National Center for Scientific Research Demokritos, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Basilis","lastName":"Gatos","id":"37726641000"},{"name":"Nikolaos Stamatopoulos","affiliation":["Computational Intelligence Laboratory, Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications, National Center for Scientific Research Demokritos, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Stamatopoulos","id":"37871395000"},{"name":"Georgios Louloudis","affiliation":["Computational Intelligence Laboratory, Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications, National Center for Scientific Research Demokritos, Athens, Greece","Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens (NKUA), Greece"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Louloudis","id":"37946288900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4500-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3725-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-5363"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-2140"}],"articleNumber":"5277779","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Handwriting recognition","Informatics","Natural languages","Text recognition","Text analysis","Computational intelligence","Laboratories","Benchmark testing","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document image processing","handwriting recognition","image segmentation","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["off-line handwriting segmentation","handwritten document image","text line"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Document Image Segmentation","Evaluation"]}],"abstract":"The Handwriting Segmentation Contest was organized in the context of ICDAR2009 conference in order to record recent advances in off-line handwriting segmentation.

For the evaluation, a well established approach is used based on counting the number of matches between the entities detected by the segmentation algorithm and the entities in the ground truth.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2009.245","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5277471/5277472/05277779.pdf","startPage":"1393","endPage":"1397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2009.245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ICDAR 2009 Handwriting Segmentation Contest","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277779/","displayDocTitle":"ICDAR 2009 Handwriting Segmentation Contest","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10904797","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277779/","conferenceDate":"26-29 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ICDAR 2009 Handwriting Segmentation Contest","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3725b393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045127S","chronDate":"26-29 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5277471","isNumber":"5277472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5277471","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5277472","articleId":"5277779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5277783,"authors":[{"name":"Emmanu\u00e8le Grosicki","affiliation":["DGA Centre d'Expertise Parisien, Arcueil cedex, France"],"firstName":"Emmanu\u00e8le","lastName":"Grosicki","id":"37266684600"},{"name":"Haikal El Abed","affiliation":["Technische Universitaet Braunschweig, Institute for Communications Technology (IfN), Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Haikal El","lastName":"Abed","id":"37691420400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4500-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3725-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-5363"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-2140"}],"articleNumber":"5277783","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"abstract":"This paper describes the handwriting recognition competition held at ICDAR 2009.

To evaluate the submitted systems, we used large datasets containing both binary and gray-scale images. Many different groups downloaded the training sets; however, finally 4 systems successfully participated in the competition. The systems were tested on two known databases and one unknown dataset. Due to the similarity between some digits and characters in Farsi and Arabic, each recognizer was tested for digit and character sets separately. For benchmarking, only the recognition rates, as the most important characteristic, are considered.

However, the creation of such a training set, including the generation of the ground truth, is tedious and costly. One way of reducing the high cost of labeled training data acquisition is to exploit unlabeled data, which can be gathered easily. Making use of both labeled and unlabeled data is known as semi-supervised learning. One of the most general versions of semi-supervised learning is self-training, where a recognizer iteratively retrains itself on its own output on new, unlabeled data. In this paper we propose to apply semi-supervised learning, and in particular self-training, to the problem of cursive, handwritten word recognition. The special focus of the paper is on retraining rules that define what data are actually being used in the retraining phase. In a series of experiments it is shown that the performance of a neural network based recognizer can be significantly improved through the use of unlabeled data and self-training if appropriate retraining rules are applied.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2009.18","startPage":"31","endPage":"35","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5277471/5277472/05277801.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2009.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating Retraining Rules for Semi-Supervised Learning in Neural Network Based Cursive Word Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semisupervised learning","Neural networks","Handwriting recognition","Text recognition","Pattern recognition","Text analysis","Computer science","Mathematics","Costs","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten character recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten word recognition","labeled training data acquisition","semisupervised learning","neural network","cursive word recognition","self-training","retraining rule evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Semi-Supervised Learning","Self-Learning","Single Word Recognition","Neural Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277801/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating Retraining Rules for Semi-Supervised Learning in Neural Network Based Cursive Word Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277801/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10904812","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating Retraining Rules for Semi-Supervised Learning in Neural Network Based Cursive Word Recognition","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3725a031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062111S","chronDate":"26-29 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5277471","isNumber":"5277472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5277471","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5277472","articleId":"5277801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5277813,"authors":[{"name":"Shehzad Muhammad Hanif","affiliation":["Institut des Syst\u00e8mes Intelligents et de Robotique, CNRS, UMR 7222, UPMC Universit\u00e9 Paris 06, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Shehzad Muhammad","lastName":"Hanif","id":"38180029900"},{"name":"Lionel Prevost","affiliation":["Institut des Syst\u00e8mes Intelligents et de Robotique, CNRS, UMR 7222, UPMC Universit\u00e9 Paris 06, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Lionel","lastName":"Prevost","id":"37270962100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4500-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3725-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-5363"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-2140"}],"articleNumber":"5277813","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":713},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Detectors","Image segmentation","Colored noise","Histograms","Intelligent robots","Neural networks","Robustness","Spatial databases","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural scenes","neural nets","object detection","text analysis","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["text detection","text localization","constrained AdaBoost algorithm","gray scale scene image","heterogeneous feature set","neural network based-localization","text locating database","video sequence","natural scene"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Text detection and localization","AdaBoost","Cascade of Boosted Ensembles","Feature selection","Feature combination","Feature complexity"]}],"abstract":"We have proposed a complete system for text detection and localization in gray scale scene images.

Result shows that the spectral efficiency can be achieved up to 9 bps/Hz under Rician channel K-factor of 3.3 dB when SNR is 30 dB. The spectral efficiency is higher under low K-factor Rician channel than in high K-factor one. The throughput of the proposed adaptive MIMO-OFDM system considers both K-factor of the Rician channel and SNR can be achieved up to 80 Mbps higher than the method without considering the Rician channel K-factor.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWS.2009.29","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Mobile WiMAX Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Mobile WiMAX Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5277817/5277818/05277849.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"188","doi":"10.1109/MWS.2009.29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Link Adaptation of MIMO-OFDM Transmission Exploiting the Rician Channel K-factor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Link Adaptation of MIMO-OFDM Transmission Exploiting the Rician Channel K-factor","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5277849/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10904898","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277849/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Link Adaptation of MIMO-OFDM Transmission Exploiting the Rician Channel K-factor","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3719a184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047779S","chronDate":"9-10 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5277817","isNumber":"5277818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5277817","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5277818","articleId":"5277849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5277853,"authors":[{"name":"Mai Abdelhakim","affiliation":["Center of Wireless Studies, Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mai","lastName":"Abdelhakim","id":"37712712000"},{"name":"Mohammed Nafie","affiliation":["Wireless Intelligent, Networks Center, Nile University, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Nafie","id":"37268935400"},{"name":"Ahmed Shalash","affiliation":["Center of Wireless Studies, Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Shalash","id":"37268936700"},{"name":"Ayman Y.

The scheme is based on adaptively puncturing a single code word (SCW) and hence adaptively changing the rate within the codeword. We compare the SCW against the multiple code-words (MCWs) scheme where different rates are obtained by separate encoding, puncturing, and interleaving on a per-tile basis. Noticeable gains are obtained over the MCW scheme due to the use of larger turbo block sizes and hence larger interleavers. The SCW has around 1 dB gain in goodput compared to MCWs, with much improved BER performance. We also propose a novel rate selection scheme for the SCW which we call recursive mutual information effective SNR mapping (R-MIESM) and compare it against the conventional MIESM scheme. The R-MIESM provides further goodput performance gains for the SCW compared to the MIESM method.","doi":"10.1109/MWS.2009.31","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Mobile WiMAX Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Mobile WiMAX Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5277817/5277818/05277853.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWS.2009.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277818","startPage":"174","endPage":"179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Puncturing and Rate Selection in Single-Codeword Turbo-Coded OFDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Puncturing and Rate Selection in Single-Codeword Turbo-Coded OFDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277853/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10904900","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5277853/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Puncturing and Rate Selection in Single-Codeword Turbo-Coded OFDMA","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3719a174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058545S","chronDate":"9-10 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5277817","isNumber":"5277818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5277817","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5277818","articleId":"5277853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5277854,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Chung Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Chung","lastName":"Chang","id":"37654873900"},{"name":"Yen-Yen Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Yen","lastName":"Lin","id":"37655871900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3989-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3719-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5277854","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Bit error rate","WiMAX","Predistortion","High power amplifiers","Nonlinear distortion","Partial transmit sequences","Modulation","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAPR reduction","OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","phase reversal scheme","WiMAX system","metric based amplitude predistortion","bit error rate","BER"]}],"abstract":"In WiMAX systems, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is chosen as the modulation format. However, the main drawback of OFDM is the high peak to average power ratio (PAPR), which significantly limits the power efficiency of the operating power amplifier in order to avoid nonlinear distortions. Recently a PAPR reduction scheme called the metric based amplitude predistortion (MBAP) has been proposed with low complexity. In this paper, we further analyze our proposed phase reversal scheme which uses the same metric as in the MBAP scheme to reduce PAPR. The main advantage of our proposed scheme is to achieve PAPR reduction without increasing the input power and also the bit error rate (BER). Simulation results indicate that the proposed phase reversal scheme can effectively improve the performance of the MBAP in most scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/MWS.2009.24","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Mobile WiMAX Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Mobile WiMAX Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5277817/5277818/05277854.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWS.2009.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277818","startPage":"180","endPage":"183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR Reduction in OFDM via Phase Reversal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PAPR Reduction in OFDM via Phase Reversal","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277854/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10904901","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5277854/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Reduction in OFDM via Phase Reversal","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3719a180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056637S","chronDate":"9-10 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5277817","isNumber":"5277818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5277817","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5277818","articleId":"5277854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5277865,"authors":[{"name":"Santi P.

The recent mobile WiMAX standard (802.16e) supports broadband applications to mobile terminals and laptops in urban environments. Mobile WiMAX supports a full range of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques including space time block coding (STBC), spatial multiplexing (SM) and eigen-beamforming (EB). This paper compares the performance of the above schemes in terms of achievable throughput and operating range. Simulated packet error rate (PER) and throughput results are presented for each MIMO technique, and for a range of modulation and coding rates. Based on a typical link-budget, the expected throughput for each scheme is computed as a function of the basestation-terminal separation distance. The paper highlights the use of adaptive MIMO switching (AMS) in mobile WiMAX. The SNR switching points between each MIMO mode is determined and their dependency on channel spatial correlation is demonstrated. Finally the operating range of the different MIMO schemes is determined (based on a 10% PER) for a mobile WiMAX system. The use of eigen-beamforming together with AMS is shown to offer significant performance benefits in terms of robustness, capacity and operating range. For the scenario under test, the use of eigen-beamforming (based on the dominant eigen-mode) extends the operating range by 16%, and doubles the received data rate for 65% of locations.","doi":"10.1109/MWS.2009.34","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Mobile WiMAX Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Mobile WiMAX Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5277817/5277818/05277866.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWS.2009.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile WiMAX Downlink Performance Analysis with Adaptive MIMO Switching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277866/","displayDocTitle":"Mobile WiMAX Downlink Performance Analysis with Adaptive MIMO Switching","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10904907","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277866/","conferenceDate":"9-10 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile WiMAX Downlink Performance Analysis with Adaptive MIMO Switching","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3719a147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050967S","chronDate":"9-10 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5277817","isNumber":"5277818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5277817","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5277818","articleId":"5277866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5277870,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37578939600"},{"name":"Jen-Yuan Hsu","affiliation":["Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Yuan","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37285968200"},{"name":"Ping-Heng Kuo","affiliation":["Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ping-Heng","lastName":"Kuo","id":"38181869500"},{"name":"Pang-An Ting","affiliation":["Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pang-An","lastName":"Ting","id":"38523301900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3989-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3719-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5277870","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","WiMAX","Covariance matrix","Symmetric matrices","Samarium","Diversity reception","Block codes","Receiving antennas","Fading","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","diversity reception","MIMO communication","mobile radio","Monte Carlo methods","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO hybrid ARQ","mobile WiMAX system","automatic retransmission request scheme","diversity order","Monte Carlo simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HARQ","MIMO","SFBC"]}],"abstract":"A novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) hybrid automatic retransmission request (HARQ) scheme using a different MIMO mode retransmission, called lower rate retransmission (LRR) scheme, is proposed in this paper.

In particular, we investigate the allocation of users over two frequency bands (i.e., 2 GHz and 5 GHz ones) for a single operator scenario. The same type of RAT is considered for both frequency bands. It is assumed that the operator considered in this work has gained access to the frequency pool with a certain portion of the available spectrum. The operator has access to a non-shared 2 GHz band and to part (or all) of the frequency pool band at 5 GHz. The performance gain is analyzed in terms of higher data throughput, reduced delay and lower blocking probability. The performance is heavily dependent on the channel quality for each user in the considered bands which, in turn, is a function of the path loss and the distance from the base station (BS). The operator will have relevant improvements when user terminals are heterogeneously distributed on the cell, with variable distances from the BS. A gain up to 400 kbps (22%) was obtained with the proposed suboptimal solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277886/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10904917","publicationDate":"July 2009","conferenceDate":"9-10 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277886/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Aggregation with Multi-band User Allocation over Two Frequency Bands","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Aggregation with Multi-band User Allocation over Two Frequency Bands","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3719a081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065882S","chronDate":"9-10 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5277817","isNumber":"5277818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5277817","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5277818","articleId":"5277886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5277894,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Hwan Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Hwan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407219300"},{"name":"Yong-Hwan Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Hwan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281125100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3989-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3719-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5277894","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Receiving antennas","Maximum likelihood detection","Interference cancellation","Vectors","Signal to noise ratio","Base stations","Downlink","System performance","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","interference suppression","maximum likelihood detection","mean square error methods","radiofrequency interference","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity ML detection","other-cell interference mitigation","mobile WiMAX system","cell boundary","minimum-mean-square-error method","successive interference cancellation","MMSE-OSIC detection","signal vectors","adjacent base station","maximum likelihood detection scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["complexity","maximum likelihood","other-cell interference"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277894","doi":"10.1109/MWS.2009.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWS.2009.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277818","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Mobile WiMAX Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Mobile WiMAX Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5277817/5277818/05277894.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"62","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity ML Detection for Other-Cell Interference Mitigation in Mobile WiMAX Systems","abstract":"The use of a maximum likelihood (ML) detection scheme is known to be optimum to mitigate other-cell interference near the cell boundary.

To improve the accuracy of channel estimation, we exploit the characteristics in three dimensions; time, frequency and spatial domain. The channel information is first estimated from pilot signal by means of a conventional least squared method in the frequency domain. Then the estimated signal is transformed into the time domain by means of inverse discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and further transformed into the spatial domain by exploiting the spatial covariance matrix of the channel. To reduce the effect of channel noise on the estimation performance, we only utilize signal components having enough power strength for the channel estimation to minimize the mean squared error. Finally, the analytic results are verified by computer simulation. Numerical results show that the proposed channel estimation scheme is quite effective in spatially correlated environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation Using Orthogonal Transformation in Spatially-Correlated Multi-antenna OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Mobile WiMAX Symposium","doi":"10.1109/MWS.2009.15","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Mobile WiMAX Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5277817/5277818/05277914.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWS.2009.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277818","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation Using Orthogonal Transformation in Spatially-Correlated Multi-antenna OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"9-10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277914/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10904931","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation Using Orthogonal Transformation in Spatially-Correlated Multi-antenna OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3719a005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060303S","chronDate":"9-10 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5277817","isNumber":"5277818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5277817","xplore-issue":"5277818","articleId":"5277914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5277948,"authors":[{"name":"Seunghwan Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5277942/5277948/5277948-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seunghwan Yoo received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Sogang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

Flash light passing through pupil is reflected on the blood vessels, and arrives at a camera lens. This phenomenon makes red-eyes in photographs. Several algorithms have been proposed for removal of red-eyes in digital photographs. This paper proposes a red-eye removal algorithm using inpainting and eye-metric information, which is largely composed of two parts: red-eye detection and red-eye correction. For red-eye detection, face regions are detected first. Next, red-eye regions are segmented in the face regions using multi-cues such as redness, shape, and color information. By region growing, we select regions, which are to be completed with iris texture by an exemplar-based inpainting method. Then, for red-eye correction, pupils are painted with the appropriate radii calculated from the iris size and size ratio. Experimental results with a large number of test photographs with red-eye effect show that the proposed algorithm is effective and the corrected eyes look more natural than those processed by the conventional algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Red-eye detection and correction using inpainting in digital photographs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2009.5277948","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5277942/05277948.pdf","startPage":"1006","endPage":"1014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2009.5277948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277948/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","displayDocTitle":"Red-eye detection and correction using inpainting in digital photographs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5277948/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","publicationDate":"August 2009","accessionNumber":"10909106","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Red-eye detection and correction using inpainting in digital photographs","sourcePdf":"p1006-yoo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084579S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5277942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5277942","articleId":"5277948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5277953,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiqin Miao","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Digital Media Processing and Transmissions, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5277942/5277953/5277953-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ruiqin Miao was born in Shanxi, China on Oct. 2, 1981.

An UEAN is a network that connects the electronic devices that belong to a person, in spite of their physical location. The \"Functional Convergence\" (FC) of personal electronic devices allows the implementation of virtual personal electronic devices, that are implemented by grouping sources, sinks, storage, processors or gateways that belong to the UEAN. We explore the feasibility to use water copper pipelines as the backbone to establish a UEAN based on the interconnection of several Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) operating in the different rooms of a house. The copper pipeline represents a good candidate to interconnect the multiple WPAN because of its high bandwidth and strong shielding to external electromagnetic noise. Some measurements in the 2.4 GHz frequency band are presented. The converging trends observed in telecommunications technology and markets, make us believe that it is important to study and model a network of personal devices in terms of an UEAN.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2009.5277958","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5277942/05277958.pdf","startPage":"1070","endPage":"1077","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2009.5277958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Personal communications using an UEAN: concept, example and measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","displayDocTitle":"Personal communications using an UEAN: concept, example and measurements","volume":"55","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5277958/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2009","accessionNumber":"10916007","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277958/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personal communications using an UEAN: concept, example and measurements","sourcePdf":"p1070-ramirez-mireles.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044928S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5277942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5277942","articleId":"5277958","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5277959,"authors":[{"name":"Jianping Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering School of Information Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5277942/5277959/5277959-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianping Wang received her PhD degree from the institute of Optoelectronic and Precision Instrument Engineering at Tianjin University in 2000.

This algorithm actively selects outer constellation points which contribute to the large peak magnitudes, and dynamically alter the amplitudes of these points to reduce PAPR. It does not require transmitting any side information to the receiver and there is no loss in data rate. As radio-over-fiber (ROF) network is proved to be one of the best solutions for the wireless-access technology, this algorithm is verified in an OFDM-ROF system. It is shown that this algorithm significantly reduces the PAPR of OFDM signals. The performances of the system with and without the algorithm are also compared.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5277942/05277959.pdf","startPage":"1078","endPage":"1082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2009.5277959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2009.5277959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PCE algorithm for PAPR reduction in OFDM-ROF system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Bit error rate","Propagation losses","Wireless networks","Next generation networking","OFDM modulation","Wireless communication","Power engineering and energy","Partial transmit sequences","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","optical fibre networks","optical modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","radio access networks","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PCE algorithm","PAPR reduction","OFDM-ROF system","peak-restricted constellation extension","peak-to-average power ratio","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","radio-over-fiber network","wireless-access technology","QPSK signaling","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM-ROF","PAPR","Constellation Extension","BER"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"PCE algorithm for PAPR reduction in OFDM-ROF system","volume":"55","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5277959/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2009","accessionNumber":"10916008","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PCE algorithm for PAPR reduction in OFDM-ROF system","sourcePdf":"p1078-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048678S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5277942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5277942","articleId":"5277959","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5277960,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In order to optimally allocate the hierarchical QAM's high priority (HP), medium priority (MP) and low priority (LP) symbol bits to the H.264/AVC video, a generic solution for optimal allocation of hierarchical QAM's high priority (HP), medium priority (MP) and low priority (LP) symbol bits to the H.264/AVC video is then proposed. Finally, a low complexity symbol bits allocation algorithm, namely ranking search algorithm, which reduces the computational complexity of the proposed optimal symbol bits allocation algorithm, is proposed. Simulation results show that our proposed UEP scheme outperforms the classical equal error protection (EEP) scheme and also the previous UEP scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5277942/05277961.pdf","startPage":"1089","endPage":"1097","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2009.5277961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2009.5277961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity Hierarchical QAM Symbol Bits Allocation Algorithm for Unequal Error Protection of Wireless Video Transmission","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Bit rate","Error correction codes","Video compression","Automatic voltage control","Bit error rate","Video coding","Electronic mail","Modulation coding","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","quadrature amplitude modulation","video coding","video communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity hierarchical QAM symbol bit allocation algorithm","quadrature amplitude modulation","unequal error protection","wireless video transmission","wireless channels","intracoded frame","predictive coded frame","group of pictures","H.264/AVC video","high-priority symbol bits","medium-priority symbol bits","low-priority symbol bits","ranking search algorithm","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unequal error protection","H.264/AVC","hierarchical QAM","wireless video transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Low Complexity Hierarchical QAM Symbol Bits Allocation Algorithm for Unequal Error Protection of Wireless Video Transmission","volume":"55","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5277961/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2009","accessionNumber":"10909110","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Complexity Hierarchical QAM Symbol Bits Allocation Algorithm for Unequal Error Protection of Wireless Video Transmission","sourcePdf":"p1089-chang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088347S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5277942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5277942","articleId":"5277961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5277962,"authors":[{"name":"Linglong Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5277942/5277962/5277962-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Linglong Dai received the bachelor degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2003.

Up to now, TDS-OFDM is only used in unidirectional data transmission such as downlink broadcasting. The difficulty to eliminate the implicitly mixed interferences between different PN sequences and inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) blocks caused by multiple users hinders the application of TDS-OFDM in multi-user uplink scenarios. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a multi-user uplink TDS-OFDM system based on dual PN padding (DPNP) where the cancellation of mixed interference is avoid by joint cyclicity reconstruction for all users. In addition, joint channel estimation and separation is also proposed to restore the transmitted signal for each user. Theoretical analysis and computer simulation not only verify the feasibility of the proposed system, but also show that, compared with the conventional single-user TDS-ODFM system, it holds lower implementation complexity yet even better system performance in mobile environments.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277942","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5277942/05277962.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2009.5277962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2009.5277962","startPage":"1098","endPage":"1106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-user uplink TDS-OFDM system based on dual PN sequence padding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277962/","displayDocTitle":"A multi-user uplink TDS-OFDM system based on dual PN sequence padding","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277962/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"10916010","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","publicationDate":"August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-user uplink TDS-OFDM system based on dual PN sequence padding","sourcePdf":"p1098-dai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048056S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5277942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5277942","articleId":"5277962","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5277965,"authors":[{"name":"Runfeng Yang","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory (SPL), University of Reading, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5277942/5277965/5277965-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Runfeng Yang (M'06) was born in Dongguan, China.

ECMA-368 has been chosen as the physical radio platform for many systems including wireless USB (W-USB), Bluetooth 3.0 and wireless HDMI; hence ECMA-368 is an important issue to consumer electronics and the users' experience of these products. To enable the transport of high-rate USB, ECMA-368 offers up to 480 Mb/s instantaneous bit rate to the medium access control (MAC) layer, but depending on radio channel conditions dropped packets unfortunately result in a lower throughput. This paper presents improvement on a high data rate modulation scheme that fits within the configuration of the current standard increasing system throughput by achieving 600 Mb/s (reliable to 3.2 meters) thus maintaining the high rate USB throughput even with a moderate level of dropped packets. The modulation system is termed improved and optimal dual circular 32-QAM (DC 32-QAM).

This PN sequence is used to do channel estimation and synchronization in the system. The existing channel estimation methods often have to adopt iterative scheme when the length of channel impulse response (CIR) is long, which will increase the receiver complexity dramatically. In this paper, a channel estimation scheme for time domain synchronous OFDM (TDS-OFDM) systems is proposed. Interference free CIR information can be obtained by constructing special correlation windows, rather than removing interference from the time domain sequences through iteration. Moreover, the estimation can be achieved by using correlation process. Comparing to conventional schemes, the proposed algorithm greatly reduces the computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed method can meet the requirement of the Chinese DTTB systems.

The performance is evaluated in terms of correlation characteristics and r.m.s frequency error. From the simulation results, it is confirmed that the proposed scheme achieve improved performance compared with the existing schemes.

Nevertheless, the specific performance of the code highly depends on the particular decoding algorithm used at the receiver. In this sense, the election of the decoding algorithm involves a trade off between the gain introduced by the code and the complexity of the decoding process. In this work we perform a thorough analysis of the different iterative decoding techniques and analyze their suitability for being implemented in the user terminals of new cellular and broadcast systems which are based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The analyzed iterative decoding algorithms are the max-log-MAP and the soft output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA), since both of them have a relative low computational complexity, simplifying their implementation in cost efficient terminals. Simulation results have been obtained for different encoder structures, block sizes and considering realistic channel conditions (an OFDM transmission over a wireless channel).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5277942/05277969.pdf","startPage":"1149","endPage":"1154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2009.5277969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2009.5277969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of turbo decoding algorithms in wireless OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","OFDM","Iterative decoding","Iterative algorithms","Wireless sensor networks","Turbo codes","Error correction codes","Nominations and elections","Broadcasting","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel coding","error correction codes","iterative decoding","maximum likelihood decoding","OFDM modulation","radio broadcasting","turbo codes","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo decoding algorithm","wireless OFDM system","error correction techniques","iterative decoding techniques","cellular systems","broadcast systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","max-log-MAP algorithm","soft output Viterbi algorithm","channel coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Turbo codes","duo binary turbo codes","iterative decoding","SOVA","Max-Log-MAP","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277969/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of turbo decoding algorithms in wireless OFDM systems","volume":"55","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5277969/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2009","accessionNumber":"10916015","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of turbo decoding algorithms in wireless OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"p1149-ortin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048764S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5277942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5277942","articleId":"5277969","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5277979,"authors":[{"name":"Imran A.

Among the most significant issues are the high error rates, because of the media characteristics, and signal attenuation with distance. In this paper, we present a robust digital baseband processor using hybrid channel estimation for wireless home audio-video receivers operating on an IEEE 802.11g wireless local area network (WLAN). The proposed hybrid channel estimation is a combined decision-directed and pilot-assisted method for perfect channel state information (CSI). Experimental results show that the proposed method increases system performance by about 3 dB over the least squares (LS) scheme at 100-ns root mean square (RMS) delay.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2009.5277986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277942","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5277942/05277986.pdf","endPage":"1270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An IEEE 802.11g WLAN Digital Baseband Processor Using Hybrid Channel Estimation for Wireless Home A/V Receivers","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2009.5277986","startPage":"1263","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5277986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"An IEEE 802.11g WLAN Digital Baseband Processor Using Hybrid Channel Estimation for Wireless Home A/V Receivers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277986/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10909120","publicationDate":"August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5277986/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An IEEE 802.11g WLAN Digital Baseband Processor Using Hybrid Channel Estimation for Wireless Home A/V Receivers","sourcePdf":"p1263-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077066S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5277942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5277942","articleId":"5277986","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5277988,"authors":[{"name":"Ronny Yongho Kim","affiliation":["LG Electronics Company Limited, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5277942/5277988/5277988-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ronny Yongho Kim (M'06) became a Member (M) of IEEE in 2006.

In addition, flash memory has the characteristics of not-in-place update and asymmetric I/O costs among read, write, and erase operations, in which the cost of write/erase operations is much higher than that of read operation. Hence, the buffer replacement algorithms in flash-based systems should take the asymmetric I/O costs into account. Previous solutions to this issue, such as CFLRU and LRU-WSR, used a clean-first scheme to first evict clean pages from the buffer. Although they outperform the traditional LRU policy in performance, they do not consider the access frequency of clean page, which will consequently result in poor I/O performance. In order to solve this problem, we present a new buffering algorithm in this paper, called CCF-LRU, which enhances the previous CFLRU and LRU-WSR methods by differentiating clean pages into cold and hot ones, and evicting cold clean pages first and delaying the eviction of hot clean pages. We conduct a trace-driven experiment on a flash memory simulation environment, and use six types of synthesized traces as well as a real OLTP trace. The results show that the CCF-LRU algorithm outperforms LRU, CFLRU and LRUWSR in write count and runtime in all experiments. In particular, it provides more than 20% improvement over its competitors both in write count and runtime, when running the real OLTP trace.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2009.5277999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2009.5277999","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5277942/05277999.pdf","startPage":"1351","endPage":"1359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CCF-LRU: a new buffer replacement algorithm for flash memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"CCF-LRU: a new buffer replacement algorithm for flash memory","volume":"55","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5277999/","publicationDate":"August 2009","accessionNumber":"10916028","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5277999/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CCF-LRU: a new buffer replacement algorithm for flash memory","sourcePdf":"p1351-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071694S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5277942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5277942","articleId":"5277999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5278000,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Lee","affiliation":["Digital Storage Research Laboratory, LG Electronics Limited, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5277942/5278000/5278000-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Lee received his B.S. and M.S. degree from Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea in 1998 and 2000, respectively.

One of the advantages of NFSDs is their read/write bandwidth, which is higher than that of the magnetic storage devices. For further increase of their bandwidth, high-end NFSDs employ multichannel and multi-way architectures in which it is possible to access the NAND Flash Memories (NFMs) in parallel for amortizing the long latency of NFMs. Even though this architecture provides higher bandwidth from the hardware perspective, the overall performance of an NFSD critically depends on how efficiently the multiple channels and ways are utilized. In this regard, the key design component is an intermediate software layer called flash translation layer (FTL), since it manages the hardware resources as well as data. To the best of authorsiquest knowledge, this is the first work to propose a general method to design an FTL for multichannel / multi-way NFSDs (FTL-MM). The proposed design method consists of two steps. First, we design an FTL for a single-channel / single-way NFSD (FTL-SS). Second, we extend the FTL to support an NFSD with an arbitrary number of channels and ways. To prove the generality and effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply the method to three well-known FTLs. The experimental results indicate that the FTLs enhanced by our approach are comparable to the ideal FTL and that their performance is scalable to various channel / way architectures. Quantitatively speaking, the average channel utilization decreases by at most 10%, when we increase the number of channels and ways up to four.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2009.5278005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5277942/05278005.pdf","startPage":"1392","endPage":"1400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2009.5278005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of Flash Translation Layers for Multi-Channel NAND Flash-based Storage Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of Flash Translation Layers for Multi-Channel NAND Flash-based Storage Devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278005/","publicationDate":"August 2009","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10909128","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278005/","volume":"55","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of Flash Translation Layers for Multi-Channel NAND Flash-based Storage Devices","sourcePdf":"p1392-park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115078S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5277942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5277942","articleId":"5278005","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5278010,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Ywan Woo","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5277942/5278010/5278010-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jong-Kwan Woo was born in Young-Chon, Korea, in 1978.

To maximize the current driving capability and protect the pull-up n-channel LDMOSFET of the output buffet, zener diode circuits are established between the gate and source of the transistor, by which the current driving capability double without increasing the transistor size. The circuit area is further saved through replacement of two high-voltage LDMOSFETs with low- voltage transistors in the level shifter, which is possible by inserting a blocking transistor.

However RTALP has been so far limited to devices operating under CW excitations and constant biasing and was therefore mostly applicable to transistors with small memory effects. In TDMA communication or radar systems, amplifiers are excited by pulsed or modulated RF signals and operate under pulsed biasing. For such applications the measurement of modulated/pulsed RF signals under pulsed biasing/RF conditions is required for a more realistic understanding of the behavior of transistors with memory effects. This paper demonstrates that under appropriate conditions it is possible to effectively combine these two excitation modes while performing large-signal measurement by sub-sampling down-conversion with a LSNA. In this demonstration, the acquisition of CW two-tone and three-tone excitations is performed using multiple-recording with pulse duty rate of 1.5% and 0.15%. The pulse-recorded measurements for the three-tone excitation are found to be consistent with CW measurements (100% duty rate). This preliminary work indicates that either intermodulation or real-time active load-pull measurements under pulsed operation can be readily realized for RF samplers with sufficiently short settling time while operating under pulsed RF modulation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARFTG.2009.5278072","publicationTitle":"2009 73rd ARFTG Microwave Measurement Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 73rd ARFTG Microwave Measurement Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5259200/5278058/05278072.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/ARFTG.2009.5278072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulsed multi-tone measurements for time domain load pull characterizations of power transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Pulsed multi-tone measurements for time domain load pull characterizations of power transistors","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5278072/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10904364","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278072/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulsed multi-tone measurements for time domain load pull characterizations of power transistors","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"23ILPNaCSnWuLa2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110811S","chronDate":"12-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5259200","isNumber":"5278058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5259200","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5278058","articleId":"5278072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5278077,"authors":[{"name":"Yilong Shen","affiliation":["RF Power & Basestation, NXP Semiconductors, Nijmegen, the Netherlands"],"firstName":"Yilong","lastName":"Shen","id":"37853016600"},{"name":"John Gajadharsing","affiliation":["RF Power & Basestation, NXP Semiconductors, Nijmegen, the Netherlands"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Gajadharsing","id":"37274960900"},{"name":"Joe Tauritz","affiliation":["Universiteit Twente, Enschede, Overijssel, NL"],"firstName":"Joe","lastName":"Tauritz","id":"37299527400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3442-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3443-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5278077","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278077","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Calibration","Phase measurement","Testing","Phase distortion","Distortion measurement","Frequency","Performance evaluation","Radiofrequency amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","distortion measurement","microwave measurement","microwave power amplifiers","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general purpose microwave power amplifier","VSG&VSA combination","dynamic characterization","phase measurement calibration","time domain systems","nonlinear phase distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Calibration","demodulation","nonlinear distortion","phase distortion","phase measurement","power amplifiers","time domain measurements"]}],"abstract":"A test setup similar in working principle to that of a commercial VSG&VSA combination is presented for the dynamic characterization of microwave power amplifiers (PAs).

The goal of the proposed procedure is to make monohulls competitive with their multihull counterparts. The resulting designs, thus, would combine the advantages of high speed vessels with those of simpler monohull vessels. The proposed strategy proposes a new re-formulation of hull optimization problem objective and uses a new class of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to achieve it. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation is used to provide the necessary data for ANN training. The advantage of the used ANN over classical ones is that it adopts a one-shot lagrangian-like training procedure. The proposed design strategy is proven to be effective through several CFD-validated design examples.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278118","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5261260/5278099/05278118.pdf","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing high speed monohull small crafts (HSMSC) using neural networks guided CFD based optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Computational fluid dynamics","Design optimization","Artificial neural networks","Design engineering","Boats","Wind","Computational modeling","Lagrangian functions","Military computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","computational fluid dynamics","learning (artificial intelligence)","marine engineering","marine vehicles","neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high speed monohull small craft design","CFD","hull optimization problem","artificial neural network","computational fluid dynamics simulation","ANN training","one-shot Lagrangian-like training procedure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Monohulls","ANN (Artificial Neural Network)","Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)","NGML (Normalized Gaussian Modified) ANN","Multi-Classifiers","RSSP (Resistance Slope Shift Point)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Designing high speed monohull small crafts (HSMSC) using neural networks guided CFD based optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278118/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10914909","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing high speed monohull small crafts (HSMSC) using neural networks guided CFD based optimization","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"090124006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058759S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5261260","isNumber":"5278099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5261260","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5278099","articleId":"5278118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5278146,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Acoustic propagation through the ocean environment severely limits the capacity of existing underwater communication systems. Specifically, the presence of internal waves coupled with the ocean sound channel creates a stochastic field that introduces deep fades and significant intersymbol interference (ISI) thereby limiting reliable communication to low data rates. In this paper we present a communication architecture that optimally predistorts the acoustic wave via spatial modulation and detects the acoustic wave with optimal spatial recombination to maximize reliable information throughput. This effectively allows the system to allocate its power to the most efficient propagation modes while mitigating ISI. Channel state information is available to the transmitter through low rate feedback. New results include the asymptotic distribution of singular values for a large number of apertures. Further, we present spatial modulation at the transmitter and spatial recombination at the receiver that asymptotically minimize bit error rate (BER). We show that, in many applications, the number of apertures can be made large enough so that asymptotic results approximate finite results well. Additionally, we show that the interference noise power is reduced proportional to the inverse of the number of receive apertures. Finally, we calculate the asymptotic BER for the sparse aperture acoustic system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater acoustics","Apertures","System performance","Transmitters","Channel state information","Intersymbol interference","Bit error rate","Acoustic propagation","Oceans","Underwater communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","error statistics","intersymbol interference","modulation","underwater acoustic communication","underwater acoustic propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic sparse aperture system","transmitter channel state information","multipath-interference rejection","underwater acoustic communication system","acoustic propagation","ocean sound channel","intersymbol interference","acoustic wave predistortion","spatial modulation","acoustic wave detection","power allocation","channel state information","bit error rate","BER"]}],"doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278156","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5261260/5278099/05278156.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underwater acoustic sparse aperture system performance: Using transmitter channel state information for multipath & interference rejection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Underwater acoustic sparse aperture system performance: Using transmitter channel state information for multipath & interference rejection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278156/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278156/","accessionNumber":"10914946","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater acoustic sparse aperture system performance: Using transmitter channel state information for multipath & interference rejection","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"090131001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058278S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5261260","isNumber":"5278099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5261260","xplore-issue":"5278099","articleId":"5278156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5278161,"authors":[{"name":"Sadia Ahmed","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of South Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Sadia","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37289344400"},{"name":"Huseyin Arslan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of South Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Huseyin","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37279667100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2522-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2523-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5278161","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Pollution measurement","Sea measurements","Acoustic measurements","Chromium","Underwater acoustics","Costs","Underwater communication","Frequency","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","telecommunication channels","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive intelligence","underwater acoustic communication channel","parameter identification","parameter measurement","parameter estimation","environment mapping","water medium","frequency dependent noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel Parameters","Cognitive Intelligence","Estimation","Mapping","Measurement","UAC"]}],"abstract":"The recent growing interest in underwater acoustic communication (UAC) requires an in depth understanding of a vast and diverse water medium. The UAC channel presents many difficulties such as high frequency, time, and space selectivity, frequency dependent noise, and significant range and band limitation on transmission. The traditional channel parameter measurement and estimation methods may not be sufficient and sometimes inapplicable to UAC, as many of the underwater situations are beyond human reach. This paper will first identify and classify the UAC channel environment, its parameters, parameter measurement and estimation methods. Then two novel cognitive intelligent algorithms will be presented to measure and estimate the parameters and map them to appropriate UAC channel environment models. To the best knowledge of the authors, the concept of cognitive intelligence (CI) and the proposed CI algorithms in UAC channel parameter measurement, estimation, and mapping ha ve not been addressed in literature to current date.

The algorithm is particularly suited for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), namely for the online generation of photo maps that can be the basis of intelligent onboard functionalities. The photo maps can be generated just based on registration, i.e., without any information about the vehicle's pose or its motion. A new method based on the Fourier-Mellin (FM) transform is presented. It is based on a 2D Fourier transform where the shift between two signals is detected by the phase information. In contrast to previous work using FM, a polar-logarithmic resampling of image information is used to turn rotation and scaling into corresponding phase shift and allow for a registration in one step.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5261260/5278099/05278193.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online generation of an underwater photo map with improved Fourier Mellin based registration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simultaneous localization and mapping","Fourier transforms","Robot sensing systems","Robustness","Underwater vehicles","Intelligent vehicles","Sea floor","Frequency","Jacobian matrices","Automotive engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","image registration","oceanographic equipment","signal detection","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater photo map online generation","Fourier Mellin based registration","stitching images","Scale Invariant Feature Transform","SIFT","Autonomous Underwater Vehicles","AUV","Fourier-Mellin transform method","2D Fourier transform","signal detection","polar-logarithmic resampling","image information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Online generation of an underwater photo map with improved Fourier Mellin based registration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278193/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10914981","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online generation of an underwater photo map with improved Fourier Mellin based registration","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"090115002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101146S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5261260","isNumber":"5278099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5261260","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5278099","articleId":"5278193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5278208,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Xu","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Wen Xu","id":"37309524600"},{"name":"Menglu Xia","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Menglu Xia","id":"37627902900"},{"name":"Qizhang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Qizhang Chen","id":"38104660400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2522-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2523-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5278208","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":530},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Finite impulse response filter","Signal processing algorithms","Radar signal processing","Signal processing","Delay","Band pass filters","Radar applications","Sonar applications","Demodulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","demodulation","fast Fourier transforms","FIR filters","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["true time-delay bandpass beamforming","array signal processing","time-delay-based and FFT","bandpass sampled signal","signal demodulation","complex envelop delay","phase rotation","delayed complex envelop","FIR filters","filter coefficient selection","polyphase filter structure","low-power high-parallel processing unit"]}],"abstract":"Beamforming as a basic approach of array signal processing has been widely used in many important applications such as radar, sonar, and communications. Typical algorithms include time-delay-based and FFT-based, and various implementation structures have been developed. For bandpass sampled signals, a true time-delay beamformer involves three processes: signal demodulation to obtain its complex envelop; delay of the complex envelop; and phase rotation of the delayed complex envelop. Those processes can be realized using FIR filters. In this paper, a few improvements are proposed for the above bandpass beamforming implementation, including a new way of filter coefficient selection and a polyphase filter structure. The new implementation generates exactly identical results as the conventional zero-padding interpolation beamformer, and meanwhile can readily fit into a low-power, highly-parallel processing unit such as FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278208","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5261260/5278099/05278208.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278208","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"True time-delay bandpass beamforming: A new implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"True time-delay bandpass beamforming: A new implementation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278208/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278208/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10914996","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"True time-delay bandpass beamforming: A new implementation","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"090112016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040063S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5261260","isNumber":"5278099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5261260","xplore-issue":"5278099","articleId":"5278208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5278210,"authors":[{"name":"David J.

To maintain the structural integrity or simply for ease of use it is often not desirable to break the wall of the enclosure, preventing any hard-wired solution. The conducting nature of the enclosure also prevents the effective use of radio communications due to the skin effect. A novel approach to this problem is to utilise acoustic transducers to transmit modulated ultrasound through the enclosure wall. A complete solution is presented including custom acoustic transducers, appropriate modulation schemes and receiver structures capable of coping with acoustic multipath. Acoustic data rates of 1-2 Mbps are shown to be achievable. When used in conjunction with a radio transceiver, RF data can be transparently routed through a conducting wall, allowing seamless connectivity throughout larger structures such as ships.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278210/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10915066","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5278210/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"High bit rate communication through metallic structures using electromagnetic acoustic transducers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High bit rate communication through metallic structures using electromagnetic acoustic transducers","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"090112014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040908S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5261260","isNumber":"5278099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5261260","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5278099","articleId":"5278210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5278224,"authors":[{"name":"Sean F.

Assuming that after proper Doppler compensation the residual ICI is limited to only direct neighbors, we propose an OFDM signal design that decouples channel estimation and data demodulation. We investigate eight receivers that are categorized into three groups: (i) three receivers that ignore the residual ICI, (ii) three receivers that are based on a basis expansion model (BEM) and pursue channel estimation independently along each basis, and (iii) two receivers that are based on discrete-path modeling. The receiver performance is compared based on data from the SPACE experiment conducted off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, October 2008. The receiver based on the discrete-path modeling and a basis pursuit algorithm achieves the best performance while the receiver based on BEM and least-squares channel estimation performs the worst. The performance differences among different receivers drastically increase as the channel's Doppler spread and the signal constellation size increase. Interestingly, the BEM based receivers are often inferior to the ICI-ignorant counterparts, implying that the ability of ICI compensation could be limited by the estimation accuracy of the much increased number of model parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receiver comparisons on an OFDM design for Doppler spread channels","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278224","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5261260/5278099/05278224.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Receiver comparisons on an OFDM design for Doppler spread channels","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278224/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10915080","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receiver comparisons on an OFDM design for Doppler spread channels","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"090111086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056309S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5261260","isNumber":"5278099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5261260","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5278099","articleId":"5278224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5278227,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37407588000"},{"name":"Yahong Rosa Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Yahong Rosa","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38184497400"},{"name":"Chengshan Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Chengshan","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37280816900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2522-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2523-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5278227","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Underwater acoustics","Underwater communication","Frequency estimation","Transducers","Phase shift keying","Mean square error methods","Equalizers","Iterative decoding","Acoustic signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal detection","error statistics","frequency-domain analysis","iterative decoding","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","quadrature phase shift keying","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain turbo equalization","underwater acoustic communication","low-complexity SC-MIMO-FDTE architecture","linear minimum mean square error criterion","single-carrier MIMO communication","multiple-input multiple-output system","decoder","iterative detection","channel impulse responses","frequency-orthogonal Chu sequences","underwater data gathering","phase shift keying signal transmission","multiple transducers","bit-error-rate","BER performance","QPSK data blocks","turbo detection","bandwidth 9.765625 kHz","distance 1000 m","distance 200 m"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates a low-complexity frequency-domain turbo equalization (FDTE) based on linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) criterion for single-carrier (SC) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) underwater acoustic communications (UAC). The receiver incorporates both the equalizer and the decoder which exchange the extrinsic information on the coded bits for each other to implement the iterative detection. The channel impulse responses (CIRs) required in the equalization are estimated in the frequency domain (FD) by inserting the well-designed pilot blocks which are frequency-orthogonal Chu sequences. The proposed SC-MIMO-FDTE architecture is applied to the fixed-to-fixed underwater data gathered during SPACE08 ocean experiments in October 2008, where multiple transducers and hydrophones are deployed in communication ranges of 200 m and 1000 m, and the channel bandwidth is 9.765625 kHz. The phase shift keying (PSK) signals are transmitted from multiple transducers in various block sizes. The proposed transceiver has been demonstrated to improve the bit-error-rate (BER) performance significantly by processing the QPSK data blocks with block length of 1024 in 200 m and 1000 m ranges.

To maximize alerting periods, to avoid false alarms and to accurately predict tsunami wave heights, real-time observations of ocean bottom pressure are required from the deep ocean. To this end, the PACT system (Pressure Acoustic Coupled Tsunameter) was developed. PACT's bottom unit combines a highly-sensitive pressure sensor, a data processing unit for automatic tsunami detection, and an acoustic modem in a single, robust housing. The data are transferred via a bidirectional acoustic link to PACT's surface unit, which is mounted to a surface buoy (not part of the PACT system), allowing also remote activation of the tsunami mode in case a wave is expected from e.g. seismic data. The PACT system has successfully passed extensive laboratory and at-sea tests. The first deployments off Indonesia as part of GITEWS are scheduled for April 2009.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278247","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5261260/5278099/05278247.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278099","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PACT \u2014 a bottom pressure based, compact deep-ocean Tsunameter with acoustic surface coupling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278247","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PACT \u2014 a bottom pressure based, compact deep-ocean Tsunameter with acoustic surface coupling","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278247/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10915103","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5278247/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PACT \u2014 a bottom pressure based, compact deep-ocean Tsunameter with acoustic surface coupling","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"090111054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044693S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5261260","isNumber":"5278099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5261260","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5278099","articleId":"5278247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5278270,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Tu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Tu","id":"38061359400"},{"name":"Dario Fertonani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Dario","lastName":"Fertonani","id":"37395257000"},{"name":"Tolga M.

So, generally, the ROV is equipped with TV cameras as the vision system and manipulators as the working system. However the manipulator operation watching a monitor, which appears the working environment taken by a TV camera, is very difficult because the operator can not have a sense of distance in the working environment. So the work ability of the manipulator depends strongly on the operator's experience and skill. Based on that, in this paper, the stereo vision system, which calculates three dimensional position data of an object in the working environment, is described. It is hoped that the position data causes the manipulator operation without the operator's experience and skill. And also, it is hoped that the dimension of the underwater object such as a marine organism can be got by the position data. In order to realize these, a camera calibration method applying the manipulator in the water was designed. And experiments were carried out to confirm the effect of the stereo vision system based on the camera model. As the result, its position accuracy was result in line with expectations.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278314","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5261260/5278099/05278314.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The stereo vision system for an underwater vehicle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278314/","displayDocTitle":"The stereo vision system for an underwater vehicle","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10915027","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278314/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The stereo vision system for an underwater vehicle","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"090109010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034879S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5261260","isNumber":"5278099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5261260","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5278099","articleId":"5278314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5278323,"authors":[{"name":"Knut Grythe","affiliation":["SINTEF ICT, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Knut","lastName":"Grythe","id":"37568547000"},{"name":"Jan Erik Hakegard","affiliation":["SINTEF ICT, Norway"],"firstName":"Jan Erik","lastName":"Hakegard","id":"37568537800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2522-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2523-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5278323","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Underwater communication","Delay estimation","Estimation error","MIMO","Mean square error methods","Underwater acoustics","Delay effects","Bit error rate","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonperfect channel estimation","OFDM-MIMO-based underwater communication","mean square error","underwater acoustic channel estimators","channel Doppler spreads","radio communication standard IEEE 802.16e","Norway","Wiener interpolator sense","delay","Trondheim harbour channel measurement","time 0.05 ms to 0.5 ms"]}],"abstract":"The main focus in this publication is on the mean square error of underwater acoustic channel estimators as function of the delay and Doppler spreads of the channel, and the effect this estimation error has on the bit error rate performance of the system both using conventional single antennas (SISO) and when using multiple antennas (MIMO).

The system parameters are taken from measurements conducted in the Trondheim harbour in Norway in 2007. The channel estimator used is not optimal in the Wiener interpolator sense. Hence, the estimator is sub-optimal, but shows good performance and has relatively low complexity. For the described communication system to perform well the results indicate that movements in the water should be less than 0.01-0.1 m/s, and delay spreads should be less than 0.05-0.5 ms. In systems where the main problem is large Doppler spread, the number of sub-carriers should be small. In systems where the main problem is large delay spread, the number of sub-carriers should be large. The use of MIMO makes the system more robust against estimation errors. The density of pilot symbols may be increased to reduce the channel estimation error somewhat, at the expense of reduced efficiency. Considering the Trondheim harbour channel measurement results and their variability throughout the year, we find that the tested system copes well with the summer conditions while the winter conditions seems to be more challenging.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278323","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5261260/5278099/05278323.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278099","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-perfect channel estimation in OFDM-MIMO-based underwater communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-perfect channel estimation in OFDM-MIMO-based underwater communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278323/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10915036","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5278323/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-perfect channel estimation in OFDM-MIMO-based underwater communication","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"090109002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044227S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5261260","isNumber":"5278099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5261260","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5278099","articleId":"5278323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5278334,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Adam Hoeher","affiliation":["ComSupport GbR, Heikendorf, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter Adam","lastName":"Hoeher","id":"37273574400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2522-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2523-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5278334","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater acoustics","Underwater communication","Modems","Bandwidth","Intersymbol interference","Frequency domain analysis","Modulation coding","Interchannel interference","Interference cancellation","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","intersymbol interference","MIMO communication","modems","modulation coding","multiplexing","software radio","time-frequency analysis","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive acoustic underwater communication","generalized multicarrier interleave-division multiplexing","time-frequency domain","superposition coded modulation","intersymbol interference","adjacent channel interference","ACI cancellation","MIMO processing","software-defined radio","acoustic modem"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive acoustic underwater communications based on generalized multi-carrier interleave-division multiplexing","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278099","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2009-EUROPE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5261260/5278099/05278334.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2009.5278334","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278334","abstract":"In this contribution, an adaptive underwater acoustic modem with high bandwidth and power efficiency is proposed. Key features include interleave-division multiplexing (IDM) in time and frequency domain (and optionally in the spatial domain) in conjunction with generalized (non-orthogonal) multi-carrier (MC) transmission. IDM is a special form of superposition coded modulation. At the receiver side, joint intersymbol interference (ISI) and adjacent channel interference (ACI) cancellation is performed, in addition to iterative decoding. Adaptation (with respect to variable data rates, variable signal power, variable signal bandwidth, variable range, variable channel conditions, variable service requirements, etc.) is supported to an extend, which is currently unknown in the area of underwater communications. The communication signal can be used for navigation/positioning purposes without modification at the transmitter side. The system design is easily applicable in underwater networks, and extendable to an arbitrary number of transducers (MIMO processing). The modem is implemented by means of software-defined radio. A wide range of potential applications is targeted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10915047","htmlLink":"/document/5278334/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive acoustic underwater communications based on generalized multi-carrier interleave-division multiplexing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive acoustic underwater communications based on generalized multi-carrier interleave-division multiplexing","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"090108001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078348S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5261260","isNumber":"5278099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5261260","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5278099","articleId":"5278334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5278349,"authors":[{"name":"Andreja Radosevic","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Andreja","lastName":"Radosevic","id":"37887861100"},{"name":"John G.

To model acoustic characteristics of emphasized speech, new contextual factors describing an emphasized accentual phrase are additionally considered in model training. Moreover, to build HMMs for synthesizing both normal speech and emphasized speech, we investigate two training methods; one is training of individual models for normal and emphasized speech using each of these two types of speech data separately; and the other is training of a mixed model using both of them simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate that 1) HMM-based speech synthesis is effective for synthesizing emphasized speech and 2) the mixed model allows a more compact HMM set generating more naturally sounding but slightly less emphasized speech compared with the individual models.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Oriental COCOSDA International Conference on Speech Database and Assessments","pdfPath":"/iel5/5256113/5278354/05278371.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"81","publicationTitle":"2009 Oriental COCOSDA International Conference on Speech Database and Assessments","doi":"10.1109/ICSDA.2009.5278371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSDA.2009.5278371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278354","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emphasized speech synthesis based on hidden Markov models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech synthesis","Hidden Markov models","Context modeling","Loudspeakers","Signal generators","Databases","Communication system control","Control system synthesis","User interfaces","Navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","speech synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech synthesis","hidden Markov models","context-dependent HMM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Emphasized speech synthesis based on hidden Markov models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278371/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906114","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emphasized speech synthesis based on hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Urumqi, China","sourcePdf":"P076081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055135S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5256113","isNumber":"5278354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5256113","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5278354","articleId":"5278371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5278404,"authors":[{"name":"Aram Danielyan","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Aram","lastName":"Danielyan","id":"38109465200"},{"name":"Alessandro Foi","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Foi","id":"37294575400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5167-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5559"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5575"}],"articleNumber":"5278404","dbTime":"74 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","Statistics","Noise reduction","Signal processing algorithms","Noise robustness","Digital images","Noise level","Noise measurement","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","filtering theory","image denoising","image matching","image processing","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise variance estimation","nonlocal transform domain","additive white Gaussian noise","nonlocal self-similarity","adaptive 3D transform decomposition","block matching","3D filtering","denoising algorithm","3D transform spectra","robust median estimator","absolute deviation"]}],"abstract":"We consider the estimation of the variance of an additive white Gaussian noise corrupting an image.

The analysis at room temperature under atmospheric pressure showed that the increase in the lanthanum content induces a transformation from the typical ferroelectric hysteresis, observed for PLZT 2,3/90/10, to double-hysteresis loops, typical of antiferroelectric phases, for PLZT 4/90/10 under a strong electric field. Hydrostatic pressure- induced and temperature-induced ferroelectric (FE) to antiferroelectric (AFE) phase transformations were examined. The measured hysteresis loops indicated that the FE-AFE phase transformation depends on both temperature and hydrostatic pressure for PLZT 3/90/10. This composition, which is in a ferroelectric state at room temperature under atmospheric pressure, can be transformed into the antiferroelectric phase by the application of a hydrostatic pressure of 100 MPa or by increasing the temperature to around 90\u00b0C. The PLZT 2/90/10 and 4/90/10 compositions displayed predominantly ferroelectric and antiferroelectric behavior, respectively, over the ranges of temperature and hydrostatic pressure examined in the present study.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5278416/05278424.pdf","startPage":"1785","endPage":"1791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278416","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of Composition and Pressure on the Electric Field-Induced Antiferroelectric to Ferroelectric Phase Transformation in Lanthanum Modified Lead Zirconate Titanate Ceramics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Influence of Composition and Pressure on the Electric Field-Induced Antiferroelectric to Ferroelectric Phase Transformation in Lanthanum Modified Lead Zirconate Titanate Ceramics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278424/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2009","volume":"56","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278424/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","publicationDate":"September 2009","accessionNumber":"10917998","pubMedId":"19811977","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of Composition and Pressure on the Electric Field-Induced Antiferroelectric to Ferroelectric Phase Transformation in Lanthanum Modified Lead Zirconate Titanate Ceramics","sourcePdf":"t0991785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057347S","chronDate":"September  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5278416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5278416","articleId":"5278424","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5278435,"authors":[{"name":"L.-W.

In this paper, we have used the minimum-variance beamformer to show how the low sidelobe levels and narrow beamwidth of adaptive methods can be used, not only to increase resolution, but also to enhance imaging in several ways. By using a minimum-variance beamformer instead of delay-and-sum on reception, reduced aperture, higher frame rates, or increased depth of penetration can be achieved without sacrificing image quality. We demonstrate comparable resolution on images of wire targets and a cyst phantom obtained with a 96-element, 18.5-mm transducer using delay-and-sum, and a 48-element, 9.25-mm transducer using minimum variance. To increase frame rate, fewer and wider transmit beams in combination with several parallel receive beams may be used. We show comparable resolution to delay-and-sum using minimum variance, 1/4th of the number of transmit beams and 4 parallel receive beams, potentially increasing the frame rate by 4. Finally, we show that by lowering the frequency of the transmitted beam and beamforming the received data with the minimum variance beamformer, increased depth of penetration is achieved without sacrificing lateral resolution.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5278416/05278437.pdf","startPage":"1868","endPage":"1879","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278416","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benefits of minimum-variance beamforming in medical ultrasound imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Array signal processing","Biomedical imaging","Image resolution","Delay","Transducers","High-resolution imaging","Apertures","Image quality","Wire"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","biomedical ultrasonics","medical image processing","phantoms","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum variance beamforming","medical ultrasound imaging","sidelobe levels","beamwidth","delay-and-sum beamforming","image quality","cyst phantom","size 18.5 mm","size 9.25 mm"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Phantoms, Imaging","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Transducers","Ultrasonography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Benefits of minimum-variance beamforming in medical ultrasound imaging","volume":"56","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5278437/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2009","accessionNumber":"10917994","pubMedId":"19811990","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Benefits of minimum-variance beamforming in medical ultrasound imaging","sourcePdf":"t0991868.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057376S","chronDate":"September  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5278416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"216","xplore-issue":"5278416","articleId":"5278437","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5278439,"authors":[{"name":"Yayun Wan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/5278416/5278439/5278439-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yayun Wan received her B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Nanchang University, China, in 2000, the M.S. degree in physics from Bowling Green State University, OH, in 2003, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, in 2006.

Nyquist sampling of array apertures dictates center-to-center spacing of \u03bb/2 for elimination of grating lobes in the array pattern. However, this requirement is hard to achieve using current transducer technologies, even at the lower end of high-frequency ultrasonic imaging (in the range 25?35 MHz). In this paper, we present a new design approach for 2-D regularized pseudoinverse (PIO) filters suitable for restoring imaging contrast in systems employing coarsely sampled arrays. The approach is based on a discretized 2-D imaging model for linear arrays assuming scattering from a Cartesian grid in the imaging field of view (FOV). We show that the discretized imaging operator can be represented with a block Toeplitz matrix with the blocks themselves being Toeplitz. With sufficiently large grid size in the axial and lateral directions, it is possible to replace this Toeplitz-block block Toeplitz (TBBT) operator with its circulant-block block circulant (CBBC) equivalent. This leads to a computationally efficient implementation of the regularized pseudoinverse filtering approach using the 2-D fast Fourier transform (FFT). The derivation of the filtering equation is shown in detail and the regularization procedure is fully described. Using FIELD, we present simulation data to show the 2-D point-spread functions (PSFs) for imaging systems employing linear arrays with fine and coarse sampling of the imaging aperture. PSFs are also computed for a coarsely sampled array with different levels of regularization to demonstrate the tradeoff between contrast and spatial resolution. These results demonstrate the well-behaved nature of the PSF with the variation in a single regularization parameter. Specifically, the 6 dB axial and lateral dimensions of the PSF increase gradually with increasing value of the regularization parameter. On the other hand, the peak grating lobe level decreases gradually with increasing value of the regularization parameter. The results are supported by image reconstructions from a simulated cyst phantom obtained using finely and coarsely sampled apertures with and without the application of the regularized 2-D PIO.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10917977","htmlLink":"/document/5278439/","pubMedId":"19811992","displayDocTitle":"A post-beamforming 2-D pseudoinverse filter for coarsely sampled ultrasound arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A post-beamforming 2-D pseudoinverse filter for coarsely sampled ultrasound arrays","sourcePdf":"t0991888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113648S","chronDate":"September  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5278416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5278416","articleId":"5278439","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5278442,"authors":[{"name":"Babak Mohammadzadeh Asl","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tarbiat Moalem University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/5278416/5278442/5278442-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Babak Mohammadzadeh Asl (S'08) was born in Ahar, Iran, in 1982.

However, due to its data-independent nature, DAS leads to images with limited resolution and contrast. In this paper, an adaptive minimum variance (MV)-based beamformer that combines the MV and coherence factor (CF) weighting is introduced and adapted to medical ultrasound imaging. MV-adaptive beamformers can improve the image quality in terms of resolution and sidelobes by suppressing off-axis signals, while keeping onaxis ones. In addition, CF weighting can improve contrast and sidelobes by emphasizing the in-phase signals and reducing the out-of-phase ones. Combining MV and CF weighting results in simultaneous improvement of imaging resolution and contrast, outperforming both DAS and MV beamformers. In addition, because of the power of CF in reducing the focusing errors, the proposed method presents satisfactory robustness against sound velocity inhomogeneities, outperforming the regularized MV beamformer. The excellent performance of the proposed beamforming approach is demonstrated by several simulated examples.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5278416/05278442.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278416","startPage":"1923","endPage":"1931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum variance beamforming combined with adaptive coherence weighting applied to medical ultrasound imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Minimum variance beamforming combined with adaptive coherence weighting applied to medical ultrasound imaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278442/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2009","accessionNumber":"10917979","pubMedId":"19811995","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5278442/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum variance beamforming combined with adaptive coherence weighting applied to medical ultrasound imaging","sourcePdf":"t0991923.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063425S","chronDate":"September  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5278416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"5278416","articleId":"5278442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5278459,"authors":[{"name":"Mario A.

This paper proposes a new approach to deconvolving Poissonian images, with the following building blocks: (a) the standard regularization/ maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion, combining the Poisson log-likelihood with a regularizer (log-prior) is adopted; (b) the resulting optimization problem (which is hard, because the log-likelihood is non-quadratic and nonseparable and the regularizer is non-smooth) is transformed into an equivalent constrained problem, by a variable splitting procedure; (c) an augmented Lagrangian method is used to address this constrained problem. The resulting algorithm is shown to outperform alternative state-of-the-art methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5259201/5278455/05278459.pdf","startPage":"733","endPage":"736","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2009.5278459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2009.5278459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deconvolution of Poissonian images using variable splitting and augmented Lagrangian optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deconvolution","Lagrangian functions","TV","Convergence","Image restoration","Biomedical imaging","Convolution","Telecommunications","Constraint optimization","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deconvolution","image processing","maximum likelihood estimation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deconvolution","Poissonian images","augmented Lagrangian optimization","medical application","astronomical application","building blocks","standard regularization","maximum a posteriori criterion","Poisson log-likelihood","optimization problem","equivalent constrained problem","variable splitting procedure","augmented Lagrangian method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278459/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","displayDocTitle":"Deconvolution of Poissonian images using variable splitting and augmented Lagrangian optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278459/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906569","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deconvolution of Poissonian images using variable splitting and augmented Lagrangian optimization","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"rp18492844.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089338S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5259201","isNumber":"5278455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5259201","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5278455","articleId":"5278459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5278462,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Full rate in each stage and full cooperative diversity for distributed EO-STBCs (D-EO-STBCs) are achieved by providing channel state information (CSI) at certain relay nodes. Two closed-loop schemes are proposed which make use of limited feedback from the destination node to a particular number of relay nodes, not exceeding half of the total number of such relay nodes. In our simulations, we use four relay nodes. Simulation results show that these two closed-loop D-EOSTBCs achieve full cooperative diversity in addition to array gain with linear processing. In particular, the proposed D-EO-STBCs designs preserve low decoding complexity and save both transmission power and total transmit time between source and destination.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10906572","htmlLink":"/document/5278462/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Extended orthogonal space time block codes in wireless relay networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended orthogonal space time block codes in wireless relay networks","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"rp18721255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041525S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5259201","isNumber":"5278455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5259201","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5278455","articleId":"5278462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5278463,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this scenario, the issue of allocating the shared channel resources (subcarrier and power) among the users is called the resource allocation problem. This problem, which is nonlinear due to its nature, also has a discrete structure. In this paper, a fast algorithm based on linear programming is proposed. The algorithm is composed of two phases. In the first one, the original integer programming problem is first linearized and then after relaxing the integer constraints a solution is obtained by the aid of the simplex algorithm. In the second phase, by exploiting the sub-carrier allocation obtained in first phase, bits are allocated to each user independently using the greedy algorithm. The simulation results have demonstrated that, the proposed algorithm can achieve a performance very close to that of the integer programming techniques while being significantly faster. Computational complexity analysis of the algorithm revealed that it can be implemented real-time on a standard microprocessor/DSP.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low complexity resource allocation algorithm for OFDMA systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2009.5278481","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5259201/5278455/05278481.pdf","startPage":"689","endPage":"692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2009.5278481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278481","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","displayDocTitle":"A low complexity resource allocation algorithm for OFDMA systems","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278481/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906591","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low complexity resource allocation algorithm for OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"rp17399340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040977S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5259201","isNumber":"5278455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5259201","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5278455","articleId":"5278481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5278482,"authors":[{"name":"Majdi Mansouri","affiliation":["ICD/M2S, University of Technology of Troyes, France"],"firstName":"Majdi","lastName":"Mansouri","id":"37395979200"},{"name":"Ilham Ouachani","affiliation":["CIRTA'COM SupCom-Parc Technologique, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ilham","lastName":"Ouachani","id":"37063315700"},{"name":"Hichem Snoussi","affiliation":["ICD/M2S, University of Technology of Troyes, France"],"firstName":"Hichem","lastName":"Snoussi","id":"37297002600"},{"name":"Cedric Richard","affiliation":["ICD/M2S, University of Technology of Troyes, France"],"firstName":"Cedric","lastName":"Richard","id":"37284386900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2709-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2710-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2711-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"5278482","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Target tracking","Wireless sensor networks","State-space methods","Information filtering","Information filters","Energy measurement","Costs","Sampling methods","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","quantisation (signal)","target tracking","variational techniques","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cramer-Rao bound","target tracking","wireless sensor networks","probabilistic state space model","variational filtering","sensor measurements","energy costs","communication constraints","binary sensor networks","adaptive quantization algorithm","target position predictive distribution","simulation results","fixed optimal quantization level"]}],"abstract":"This work deals with the problem of target tracking in wireless sensor networks where the observed system is assumed to evolve according to a probabilistic state space model. We propose to improve the use of the variational filtering (VF) by quantizing the data collected by the sensors to higher levels respecting the tradeoff between the information relevance of sensor measurements and the energy costs. In fact, VF has been shown to be suitable to the communication constraints of sensor networks. Its efficiency relies on the fact that the online update of the filtering distribution and its compression are simultaneously performed. But till now, it has been used only for binary sensor networks. In this paper, we propose an adaptive quantization algorithm taking benefit from the VF properties. At each sampling instant, by minimizing the Crameacuter-Rao bound, the adaptive quantization technique provides the optimal number of quantization bits per observation. The computation of this criteria is based on the target position predictive distribution provided by the VF algorithm. The simulation results show that the adaptive quantization algorithm, for the same sensor transmitting power, outperforms both the VF algorithm using a fixed optimal quantization level (minimizing the MSE) and the VF algorithm based on binary sensors.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2009.5278482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278455","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5259201/5278455/05278482.pdf","endPage":"696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cramer-Rao bound-based adaptive quantization for target tracking in wireless sensor networks","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2009.5278482","startPage":"693","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cramer-Rao bound-based adaptive quantization for target tracking in wireless sensor networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278482/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10906592","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5278482/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cramer-Rao bound-based adaptive quantization for target tracking in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"rp17413492.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093372S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5259201","isNumber":"5278455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5259201","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5278455","articleId":"5278482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5278484,"authors":[{"name":"Joao Mendes Filho","affiliation":["Escola Polit\u00e9cnica, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Joao Mendes","lastName":"Filho","id":"38242635000"},{"name":"Magno T.

We show the effectiveness of our approach by computer simulations using the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) as joint recovery method, and we discuss the configuration of the distribution strategy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5259201/5278455/05278496.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"641","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2009.5278496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2009.5278496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensing matrix optimization in Distributed Compressed Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Matching pursuit algorithms","Technological innovation","Distributed control","Sparse matrices","Dictionaries","Sensor systems","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Optimization methods","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation theory","encoding","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensing matrix optimization","distributed compressed sensing","distributed coding strategy","efficient projection method","computer simulations","orthogonal matching pursuit","joint recovery method","correlated signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed Compressed Sensing","Sensor Network","Projection Matrix Optimization","Correlated signals"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sensing matrix optimization in Distributed Compressed Sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278496/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906606","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensing matrix optimization in Distributed Compressed Sensing","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"rp16048717.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04269S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5259201","isNumber":"5278455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5259201","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5278455","articleId":"5278496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5278497,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["Philips Research Europe, Eindhoven, Netherlands","Department of EEMCS, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"lastName":"Ying Wang","id":"37311555300"},{"name":"Geert Leus","affiliation":["Department of EEMCS, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Geert","lastName":"Leus","id":"38469519700"},{"name":"Ashish Pandharipande","affiliation":["Philips Research Europe, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Pandharipande","id":"37266388400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2709-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2710-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2711-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"5278497","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1921},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Array signal processing","Direction of arrival estimation","Sensor arrays","Antenna arrays","Receiving antennas","Circuits","Hardware","Signal resolution","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sampling array processing","spatial domain","direction-of-arrival estimation","hardware complexity","software complexity","beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sampling","direction-of-arrival estimation","beamforming"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new architecture, the compressive sampling (CS) array, for array based applications, by exploiting compressive sampling in the spatial domain.

The estimator is based on the computation of a weighted phase histogram named Constellation Phase Signature (CPS). The CPS is defined as the phase-dependent distribution of the received signal modulus after the application of a non-linear transformation. Here we show how the CPS can be exploited to derive a sub-optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator that approaches the CRLB for medium-high SNR. Specifically, the values of the measured CPS can be recognized as frequencies of recurrence of the received samples phases. Stemming on this observation, the CPS values can be regarded as a multinomial distributed random variable for which we are able to conduct the maximization of the likelihood function. The theoretical analysis of the estimator performance is carried out in close form. The theoretical estimator performance is compared with those of state-of-art estimators and of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB).

The paper proposes a signal model based on the assumption of a small array aperture relative to the signal wavelength and a single target in far field. It is argued that near maximum likelihood performance can be obtained by choosing the transmitted waveforms on different antennas to be orthogonal. The Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) for estimating the target distance, radial velocity and wavenumber is derived. The paper presents a convex optimisation procedure to yield an optimal energy distribution across the transmitted signals. Simulations demonstrate a reduction in CRB in the order of 25% compared to the use of a random unitary code. The paper concludes by indicating a natural generalisation of the method to optimal design for MIMO tracking radars.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal waveform precoder design for narrowband MIMO radar systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2009.5278526","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5259201/5278455/05278526.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2009.5278526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278526/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal waveform precoder design for narrowband MIMO radar systems","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278526/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906695","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal waveform precoder design for narrowband MIMO radar systems","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"rp13058014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055423S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5259201","isNumber":"5278455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5259201","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5278455","articleId":"5278526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5278527,"authors":[{"name":"Balakumar Balasingam","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Balakumar","lastName":"Balasingam","id":"37645880800"},{"name":"Miodrag Bolic","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Miodrag","lastName":"Bolic","id":"37396308000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2709-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2710-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2711-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"5278527","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"abstract":"In this paper a novel blind adaptive decoding algorithm based on marginalized particle filter (MPF) method is developed for multipleinput multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) communication systems.

In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm for this problem based on compressed sensing which is an emerging technique for efficient data reconstruction.

Different from conventional approaches, in the second stage, the sources are recovered by using a compressed sensing approach. This is motivated by the similarity between the mathematical models adopted in compressed sensing and source separation.

In this paper, we formulate the beampattern optimization problem as minimization of a multivariate quartic polynomial. The advantage of this approach is that iterative line searches are not needed and that the low-rank case can be solved directly without finding the minima of the full-rank system. The method does not guarantee convergence to the global minimum, but numerical examples provided demonstrate that results comparable to the other approaches are achieved.","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2009.5278546","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5259201/5278455/05278546.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2009.5278546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278455","startPage":"437","endPage":"440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beampattern optimization by minimization of quartic polynomial","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Beampattern optimization by minimization of quartic polynomial","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278546/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10961938","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5278546/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beampattern optimization by minimization of quartic polynomial","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"rp11054817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034081S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5259201","isNumber":"5278455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5259201","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5278455","articleId":"5278546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":5278548,"authors":[{"name":"J.

While the source transmits its message to its destination, a relay node transmits a jamming signal to create interference at the eavesdropper. In this paper, a scenario in which the relay is equipped with multiple antennas is considered. A novel system design is proposed for determining the antenna weights and transmit power of source and relay, so that the system secrecy rate is maximized subject to a total transmit power constraint, or, the transmit power is minimized subject to a secrecy rate constraint. Since the optimal solutions to these problems are difficult to obtain, suboptimal closed-form solutions are proposed that introduce an additional constraint, i.e., the complete nulling of jamming signal at the destination.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5259201/5278455/05278549.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"420","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2009.5278549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2009.5278549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative jamming for wireless physical layer security","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Communication system security","Physical layer","Relays","Power system relaying","Wireless networks","Computer security","Physics computing","Signal design","Antenna feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jamming","radio networks","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative jamming","wireless physical layer security","eavesdropper","relay node","multiple antennas","novel system design","system secrecy rate","transmit power constraint","suboptimal closed-form solutions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["physical layer security","secrecy rate","cooperation","cooperative jamming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative jamming for wireless physical layer security","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278549/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10961941","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative jamming for wireless physical layer security","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"rp10561504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046992S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5259201","isNumber":"5278455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5259201","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5278455","articleId":"5278549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5278556,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Plourde","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Plourde","id":"37698087100"},{"name":"Benoit Champagne","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Champagne","id":"37296590000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2709-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2710-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2711-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"5278556","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278556","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Amplitude estimation","Speech enhancement","Frequency estimation","Closed-form solution","Background noise","Electronic mail","Cellular phones","Hearing aids","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude estimation","Bayes methods","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech enhancement","Bayesian spectral amplitude estimation","correlated spectral components","single channel","STSA estimator","correlated frequency components","closed form expressions","upper bounds","lower bounds","informal listening"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech enhancement","Bayesian estimation","short-time spectral amplitude"]}],"abstract":"In Bayesian short-time spectral amplitude (STSA) estimation for single channel speech enhancement, the spectral components are traditionally assumed to be uncorrelated.

The main challenge for transmit beamforming design is to suppress the co-channel interference (CCI) from other users. In order to completely cancel the CCI at each user, perfect channel state information (CSI) is required at base station, which is generally not available in practice. To overcome the performance degradation caused by the imperfections, the most common approach is the worst-case method, which leads to conservative result as the extreme (but rare) conditions may occur at a very low probability. In this work, we propose a probabilistic-constrained beamforming based on signal-to-leakage ratio (SLR) criterion under consideration of inaccurate channel information. The simulation results show that the proposed beamformer achieves the lowest bit error rate (BER) and leaks the least transmit power from the desired user to all other users among the state-of-art transmit beamformers.","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2009.5278576","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5259201/5278455/05278576.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2009.5278576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust leakage-based transmit beamforming with probabilistic constraint for downlink multi-user MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278576/","displayDocTitle":"Robust leakage-based transmit beamforming with probabilistic constraint for downlink multi-user MIMO system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10961947","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278576/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust leakage-based transmit beamforming with probabilistic constraint for downlink multi-user MIMO system","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"rp08086536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065987S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5259201","isNumber":"5278455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5259201","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5278455","articleId":"5278576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5278577,"authors":[{"name":"Bahador Makki Abadi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Islamic Azad University, Ashtian, Iran","Centre of Digital Signal Processing, School of Engineering, Cardiff University, UK"],"firstName":"Bahador Makki","lastName":"Abadi","id":"37888422300"},{"name":"Amir Sarrafzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Sarrafzadeh","id":"37889947600"},{"name":"Delaram Jarchi","affiliation":["Centre of Digital Signal Processing, School of Engineering, Cardiff University, UK"],"firstName":"Delaram","lastName":"Jarchi","id":"37586999600"},{"name":"Vahid Abolghasemi","affiliation":["Centre of Digital Signal Processing, School of Engineering, Cardiff University, UK"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Abolghasemi","id":"37586999500"},{"name":"Saeid Sanei","affiliation":["Centre of Digital Signal Processing, School of Engineering, Cardiff University, UK"],"firstName":"Saeid","lastName":"Sanei","id":"37285025800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2709-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2710-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2711-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"5278577","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source separation","Channel estimation","MIMO","Tensile stress","Receiving antennas","Fading","Signal detection","Transmitting antennas","Multiaccess communication","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","blind source separation","channel estimation","MIMO communication","m-sequences","signal detection","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semi-blind signal separation","channel estimation","MIMO communication systems","tensor factorization","3-way tensor analysis","receiver antennas","user data symbols","multi-way analysis","PARAFAC2","M-sequence training symbols","MMSE-VBLAST signal detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tensor Factorization","PARAFAC2","MIMO Detection","Fading Channel Estimation","Semi-Blind Source Separation","M-Sequence","MMSE-VBLAST"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a tensor-factorization method for signal detection in MIMO applications.

The scheme provides an efficient way to deal with filters with large number of elements. It consists of a bank of full-rank adaptive filters that forms a transformation matrix and an adaptive reduced-rank filter that operates at the output of the bank of filters. The transformation matrix projects the received vector onto a low-dimension vector, which is processed by the reduced-rank filter to estimate the desired signal. The expressions of the transformation matrix and the reduced-rank weight vector are derived according to the constrained constant modulus (CCM) criterion subject to different constraints. Two low-complexity adaptive algorithms are devised for the implementation of the proposed scheme with different constraints. Simulations are performed to show superior performance of the proposed algorithms in comparison with the existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10906638","htmlLink":"/document/5278615/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive reduced-rank constrained constant modulus beamforming algorithms based on joint iterative optimization of filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive reduced-rank constrained constant modulus beamforming algorithms based on joint iterative optimization of filters","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"rp03916350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053907S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5259201","isNumber":"5278455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5259201","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5278455","articleId":"5278615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5278627,"authors":[{"name":"Baris Yuksekkaya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Baris","lastName":"Yuksekkaya","id":"38108443600"},{"name":"Cenk Toker","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Cenk","lastName":"Toker","id":"37273614600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2709-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2710-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2711-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"5278627","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","MIMO","Frequency","Transmitters","Interference","Equalizers","Digital filters","Signal processing","Data engineering","Design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","equalisers","filters","interference","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","multiuser detection","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint transceiver design","multiuser MIMO channel shortening equalization","joint transmitter receiver filter optimization","frequency selective multiuser multiple input multiple output system","channel impulse response","minimum mean square error criterion","maximum transmit power limit","channel duality","broadcast frequency","multiple access frequency","interference frequency","MIMO frequency selective channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel shortening","equalization","joint transmitter-receiver design","frequency selective","multi-user","multiple input multiple output","channel duality"]}],"abstract":"In this work, the issue of joint transmitter receiver filter optimization for channel shortening is addressed for a frequency selective multiuser multiple input multiple output system. The channel impulse response is shortened according to the minimum mean square error criterion and under a maximum transmit power limit.

Compressive sensing (CS) is an attractive approach for reducing the number of data samples, without a significant degradation of the original image that is generated using the full array aperture and frequency band. In this paper, we apply CS technique to TWRI using well known Fourier-like matrices. The proposed method applies CS independently to the data samples of the radar returns of each antenna location. It then incorporates the results into the delay-and-sum beam-forming to provide a through-the-wall radar image. Simulation results show that the proposed method can provide a high-quality radar image using less than 20% of the data samples.","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2009.5278632","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5259201/5278455/05278632.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2009.5278632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Imaging of behind the wall targets using wideband beamforming with compressive sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278632/","displayDocTitle":"Imaging of behind the wall targets using wideband beamforming with compressive sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906655","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278632/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Imaging of behind the wall targets using wideband beamforming with compressive sensing","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"rp02415237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.154924S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5259201","isNumber":"5278455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5259201","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5278455","articleId":"5278632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5278637,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Uhlich","affiliation":["Chair of System Theory and Signal Processing, Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Uhlich","id":"37572669200"},{"name":"Benedikt Loesch","affiliation":["Chair of System Theory and Signal Processing, Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Benedikt","lastName":"Loesch","id":"37637076200"},{"name":"Bin Yang","affiliation":["Chair of System Theory and Signal Processing, Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37399884400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2709-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2710-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2711-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"5278637","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polynomial LMMSE estimation: A case study","abstract":"This paper investigates the potential of the polynomial LMMSE estimation for nonlinear/nongaussian estimation problems.

The degradation of the detection performance due to the estimation of the covariance matrix and the fluctuation of the target is studied through simulations for both the well-known Optimum Gaussian Detector (OGD) and the new MIMO detector under Gaussian and non-Gaussian clutter.","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2009.5278651","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5259201/5278455/05278651.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2009.5278651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive MIMO radar detection in non-Gaussian and heterogeneous clutter considering fluctuating targets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278651/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive MIMO radar detection in non-Gaussian and heterogeneous clutter considering fluctuating targets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906674","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278651/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive MIMO radar detection in non-Gaussian and heterogeneous clutter considering fluctuating targets","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"rp00325254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066689S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 3 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5259201","isNumber":"5278455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5259201","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5278455","articleId":"5278651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5278654,"authors":[{"name":"Pascal Bianchi","affiliation":["CNRS/LTCI Telecom Paristech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Bianchi","id":"37284532300"},{"name":"Jamal Najim","affiliation":["CNRS/LTCI Telecom Paristech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jamal","lastName":"Najim","id":"37403635500"},{"name":"Mylene Maida","affiliation":["Laboratoires de Math\u00e9matiques, Universit\u00e9 de Paris-Sud, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Mylene","lastName":"Maida","id":"37846752100"},{"name":"Merouane Debbah","affiliation":["Chaire Alcatel-Lucent, SUPELEC, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Merouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2709-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2710-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2711-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"5278654","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Testing","Collaboration","Covariance matrix","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Noise cancellation","Telecommunications","Radio transmitters","Signal analysis","H infinity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigen-based hypothesis tests","collaborative sensing","covariance matrix","generalized likelihood ratio test","observation window length","sensor number","cognitive radio applications","random matrix theory","error exponent curve"]}],"abstract":"In this contribution, we provide a theoretical study of two hypothesis tests allowing to detect the presence of an unknown transmitter using several sensors.

Therefore the inverter torque and flux are introduced and the MPDTC scheme is redesigned to keep them and the inverter's neutral point potential within given hysteresis bounds also according to today's state-of-the-art solution with DTC. Moreover the MPDTC control objective is altered to target directly the reduction of the inverter switching losses rather than the switching frequency, resulting in a significant reduction of the switching losses with respect to standard DTC.

Moreover, the effect of using the proposed controller on common-mode and differential-mode noise, total conducted-noise, and radiated-noise characteristics of the converter has been experimentally investigated. Furthermore, sweeping of the three randomization parameters has been carried-out for reaching the values which achieve the best conducted-noise spectrum spreading. All the 64 studied cases have been designed, implemented and experimentally investigated. Then, the conducted-noise spectrums have been compared. The experimental results show that using the proposed technique, with the reached randomization parameter values, significantly improves the conducted-noise spectrum and effectively reduces the noise peaks at both high and low frequency ranges. Moreover, the radiated-noise spectrum has been improved.","publicationTitle":"2009 13th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 13th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5254890/5278662/05278699.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Triple-hybrid spread-spectrum technique for conducted-noise reduction in DC-DC converters with an FPGA-based implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278699/","displayDocTitle":"Triple-hybrid spread-spectrum technique for conducted-noise reduction in DC-DC converters with an FPGA-based implementation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10939588","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278699/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Triple-hybrid spread-spectrum technique for conducted-noise reduction in DC-DC converters with an FPGA-based implementation","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"0326epe2009full02511170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063217S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254890","isNumber":"5278662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254890","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5278662","articleId":"5278699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5278714,"authors":[{"name":"O.

They use large numbers of identical series connected modules, each of which contains a capacitor that can be switched in or out of circuit to present a continually variable voltage at the converter terminals. The technique permits multilevel converters to be constructed without the disadvantages associated with other multilevel topologies and have created major interest for high voltage power transmission applications since complex waveforms can be constructed without the filtering associated with converters utilising PWM. The approach proposed is to operate converter topologies built up from combinations of chain circuits as sets of individual current sources. These are arranged as a matrix form so the current from the input and output terminals are able to circulate through all the chain elements in a subtractive manner. To maintain the capacitor charge level in each chain circuit the net power flow must be zero which can commonly be achieved only for AC to AC or AC to DC power conversion. Additional control is required to trim the operation of the chains to ensure average capacitor voltage in a chain is constrained to a defined level, although the simulation results presented do not include this. An example of a topology that can be derived by this approach is the Matrix Chainlink converter that can directly convert three-phase AC to three-phase AC. A second topology is proposed that will give a AC to 4 quadrant DC converter form that will yield a galvanically isolated DC to DC converter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278738/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10939334","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278738/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A methodology for developing \u2018Chainlink\u2019 converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A methodology for developing \u2018Chainlink\u2019 converters","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"0508epe2009full18263341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051175S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254890","isNumber":"5278662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254890","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5278662","articleId":"5278738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5278763,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper presents a digitally-controlled multilevel buck converter suitable to supply radiofrequency power amplifiers: it achieves high efficiency, low output voltage ripple and high tracking bandwidth. An hybrid pulse-width modulation system implemented in a FPGA generates the appropriate control pulses for the transistors, which are drived from an especial floating driver scheme.

High-speed drive systems are capable of directly driving turbo-compressors at speeds of up to 20,000 rpm / 8 MW. In high speed motor drive applications, the motor fundamental frequency can vary from 100 Hz to 300 Hz, which requires a high switching frequency. However, switching losses increase with switching frequency and these losses represent a critical point for high voltage semiconductors. Soft switching topology could represent a relevant solution to work at high switching frequency. The drawback of such a converter is the number of added components and the complexity of the control. Multilevel inverters provide output signals with low harmonic distortion. When the number of level increases, the output voltage THD decreases but the size and the cost of the system increases as well. The switching voltage is reduced when the number of level increases, depending on the topologies, or when a series connection of components is made. This paper reports a 3-level converter structure for high speed motor drive applications that allows decreasing switching losses in comparison with the well known 3-level NPC (neutral point clamped) inverter. This feature leads to the possibility to increase the switching frequency or the load current level thanks to series connection of IGBTs. As the neutral point is actively piloted, this structure is named NPP (neutral point piloted).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5278793/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10939724","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A converter topology for high speed motor drive applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A converter topology for high speed motor drive applications","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"0281epe2009full18070037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076715S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254890","isNumber":"5278662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254890","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5278662","articleId":"5278793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5278794,"authors":[{"name":"Antonios Antonopoulos","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electrical Machines And Power Electronics, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Antonios","lastName":"Antonopoulos","id":"37543937000"},{"name":"Lennart Angquist","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electrical Machines And Power Electronics, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Lennart","lastName":"Angquist","id":"37294600900"},{"name":"Hans-Peter Nee","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electrical Machines And Power Electronics, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hans-Peter","lastName":"Nee","id":"37328132300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4432-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-90-75815-13-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5278794","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":150,"citationCountPatent":28,"totalDownloads":9763},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Capacitors","Leg","Capacitance","Circuit topology","Power conversion","Pulse width modulation","Switching frequency","Arm","Converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power convertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular multilevel converter","converter system","variable voltage sources","discrete half-bridge modules","self-stabilizing voltage controller","phase legs","arm voltages"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Converter control","Multilevel converters","Modulation strategy","Emerging topology","VSC"]}],"abstract":"This paper discusses the impact of modulation on stability issues of the Modular Multilevel Converter (M2C). The main idea is to describe the operation of this converter system mathematically, and suggest a control method that offers stable operation in the whole operation range. A possible approach is to assume a continuous model, where all the modules in each arm are represented by variable voltage sources, and as a result, all pulse width modulation effects are disregarded. After simulating this model and testing different control methods, useful conclusions on the operation of the M2C have been extracted. The control methods are then implemented on a model with discrete half-bridge modules, in order to compare the results and to validate the continuous model approach. When assuring that this model functions as expected, the goal of this paper is to conclude into a self-stabilizing voltage controller. A controller is proposed, which eliminates circulating currents between the phase legs and balances the arm voltages regardless of the imposed alteranting current.","publicationTitle":"2009 13th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 13th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5254890/5278662/05278794.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On dynamics and voltage control of the Modular Multilevel Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278794/","displayDocTitle":"On dynamics and voltage control of the Modular Multilevel Converter","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10939701","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278794/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On dynamics and voltage control of the Modular Multilevel Converter","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"0578epe2009full09505021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070718S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254890","isNumber":"5278662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254890","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"5278662","articleId":"5278794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5278846,"authors":[{"name":"Masaya Harakawa","affiliation":["Nagoya Works Research & Development Department, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaya","lastName":"Harakawa","id":"38056355900"},{"name":"Christian Dufour","affiliation":["Opal-RT Technologies, Inc., Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Dufour","id":"37274485900"},{"name":"Shunichi Nishimura","affiliation":["Nagoya Works Research & Development Department, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Shunichi","lastName":"Nishimura","id":"38101704300"},{"name":"Tetsuaki Nagano","affiliation":["Nagoya Works Research & Development Department, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuaki","lastName":"Nagano","id":"38053044500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4432-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-90-75815-13-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5278846","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":441},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Testing","Motor drives","Synchronous motors","Computational modeling","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Virtual prototyping","Added delay","Voltage","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric drives","fault diagnosis","permanent magnet machines","synchronous machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time simulation","PMSM drive","faulty modes","actual drive system","permanent magnet synchronous machine drive","fixed-causality models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real time Simulation","Permanent magnet motor","Test bench","Adjustable speed drive","Fault recovery strategy"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents real-time simulation results of a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drive in faulty and non-standard modes and validates these against an actual industrial PMSM drive system.

In this work, limitations with respect to efficiency of the whole magnetic system are investigated. The power efficiency of a given structure is dependent on resonant matching and on the load impedance. First, the matching conditions for optimal power efficiency are derived. Then the achievable efficiency for inductive transmission structures with varying distance and size ratios are investigated. Recent publications on inductive power transmission are evaluated and discussed based on these results. As a conclusion, inductive power transmission in a larger space (e.g. a whole room) is very inefficient. On the other hand, inductive power transmission at a surface can be efficient as conventional power supplies. Based on this insight, an inductive power transmission pad has been designed and built, with the purpose to charge mobile devices like mobile phones. It can charge an arbitrary number of devices and allows free positioning of the devices on the pad. It consists of an array of planar transmitter coils and has a size of 20 cm times 26 cm. It can detect the position of a receiver and activates only the coils underneath a receiver.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limitation of inductive power transfer for consumer applications","publicationTitle":"2009 13th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 13th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5254890/5278662/05278868.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5278868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5278868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Limitation of inductive power transfer for consumer applications","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5278868/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10939705","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limitation of inductive power transfer for consumer applications","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"0607epe2009full17095540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065391S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254890","isNumber":"5278662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254890","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5278662","articleId":"5278868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5278895,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.R.

Highly compact converters designs based on these topologies can be envisioned. However, the design of the gate-driver power-supply for the multiple controlled semiconductor devices remains an important issue to be addressed. This paper focuses on the design of such circuits and the analysis of the resulting multilevel converter performance. A simple circuit connected across each power switch and monolithically integrable within it is selected. These circuits lead to simple, compact, and efficient converter designs.

MF operation allows a reduction of the transformer size and weight, thus leading to a compact and efficient design, which minimizes the installation and maintenance costs. This paper presents design considerations for dry-type single-phase MF power transformers in offshore wind farms.

Low and medium output powers required for this application implies the use of higher switching frequencies, which leads to an efficiency decrease. Asymmetrical duty cycle (ADC) modulation scheme is proposed to improve efficiency due to its switching frequency reduction and absence of additional hardware requirements. Study methodology comprises, in a first step, a theoretical analysis of power balance as a function of control parameters: duty cycle and switching frequency. In addition, restrictions due to snubber and dead time, and variability of the induction loads have been considered. Afterwards, an efficiency analysis has been carried out to determine the optimum operation point. Switching and conduction losses have been calculated to examine global importance of each one for different switching devices. ADC modulation efficiency improvement is achieved by means of a switching frequency reduction, mainly at low-medium power range and low quality factor (Q) loads. The analytical results obtained with this study have been validated through an induction heating test-bench. A discrete 3-kW RL load has been designed to emulate a typical induction heating load. Then, a commercial induction heating inverter is used to evaluate ADC modulation scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10939666","htmlLink":"/document/5279059/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency optimization of half-bridge series resonant inverter with asymmetrical duty cycle control for domestic induction heating","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency optimization of half-bridge series resonant inverter with asymmetrical duty cycle control for domestic induction heating","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"0050epe2009full14465151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054799S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254890","isNumber":"5278662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254890","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5278662","articleId":"5279059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5279065,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.R.

In its most general form, the design problem requires minimizing the mass or overall dimensions of the core and windings as well as the loss of the transformer while ensuring the satisfaction of a number of constraints. In this contribution, the area product (i.e. the product of the core cross section and the winding area) and the power loss are used as objective functions whereas the operating frequency and the maximum flux density are chosen as optimization variables. The constraints include, as for them, appropriate limits on efficiency, maximum surface temperature rise and maximum ratio no-load/full load current. The area product is optimized in place of weight or volume of the transformer because these two quantities can be easily expressed in terms of area product. It is an elegant mean to limit the number of objective functions. The major advantage of the suggested design procedure is that it proposes to the designer a set of optimal transformers - instead of a single solution - so he can choose a posteriori which of them best fits the application under consideration. Finally, in order to illustrate the design procedure, the optimal design of a transformer supplied with square voltage waveform is performed and the results are discussed.","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 13th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5254890/5278662/05279136.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 13th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective optimal design of high frequency transformers using genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Frequency","Genetic algorithms","Transformer cores","Hafnium","Switched-mode power supply","Design optimization","Temperature","Magnetic flux","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","transformer windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimal design","high frequency transformers","genetic algorithm","multiobjective optimization design","core cross section","area product","winding product","operating frequency","maximum flux density","square voltage waveform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magnetic device","Passive component","Transformer","Design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective optimal design of high frequency transformers using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279136/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10939832","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective optimal design of high frequency transformers using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"0075epe2009full08212865.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046252S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254890","isNumber":"5278662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254890","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5278662","articleId":"5279136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5279178,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The paper also covers the detailed analysis of SincK-filters (known as decimation filter) with different decimation ratios and filter orders, and a detailed analysis of the impulse response for the synchronization of the filter with the controller. The SincK-filter is integrated into a field-oriented control for permanent magnet synchronous motors. The whole system is realized on a FPGA-based control platform.

The GA is employed to increase the energy efficiency of the system, considering that only the best individuals of a population are selected to create new possible solutions and these are meant to improve the energy efficiency of the system; the node and the reactive power values are considered as the elements needed to maximize the fitness function. Simulations are performed on a 33 bus test power system employing two different Matlab programs to run the power flow and the location of the device. The power flow program performs a voltage limits check. Results show the evolution and the increase of the energy efficiency in the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279283/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10939407","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279283/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"FACTS location using genetic algorithm to increase energy efficiency in distribution networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FACTS location using genetic algorithm to increase energy efficiency in distribution networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"0230epe2009full15193735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076017S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254890","isNumber":"5278662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254890","xplore-issue":"5278662","articleId":"5279283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5279321,"authors":[{"name":"Karsten Wiedmann","affiliation":["Institute of Drive Systems and Power Electronics, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Karsten","lastName":"Wiedmann","id":"37970070300"},{"name":"Florian Wallrapp","affiliation":["Wittenstein Electronics GmbH, Igersheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Wallrapp","id":"38112098000"},{"name":"Axel Mertens","affiliation":["Institute of Drive Systems and Power Electronics, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Axel","lastName":"Mertens","id":"37297781600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4432-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-90-75815-13-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5279321","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":872},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal analysis","Magnetic analysis","Sensorless control","Permanent magnet machines","Voltage","Pulse width modulation inverters","Nonlinear distortion","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Uniform resource locators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","invertors","machine control","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverter nonlinearity effects","sensorless control method","permanent magnet synchronous machine drives","pulsating high-frequency signal injection","inverter output voltage distortions","rotor position detection","stator current","compensation","PMSM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensorless control","self-sensing control","synchronous motor","converter control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279321","abstract":"This paper reports on inverter nonlinearity effects on sensorless control methods based on high-frequency signal injection (HF-injection).

In this application an aggressive power management solution is required in order to collect a sufficient amount of energy in storage elements in general from different power sources. This paper is focused on the development of the power supply systems, in particular on switching converters for energy harvesting applications. Its main goal is the development of high efficiency conversion systems, featuring the minimum number of conversion stages and of magnetic components, and the optimization of the power management. In particular the paper is focused on multi-input/multi-output dc-dc converters, enabling the connection of one or more sources of energy (solar, vibrational, RF, etc.), of some energy accumulation devices (micro-batteries, capacitors, supercapacitors), and several loads (microcontroller, transmitter, sensors, etc.). The modulation techniques and the power management are also discussed, to comply with multi-source/multi-load conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279327/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10939652","htmlLink":"/document/5279327/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Power management in multi-source multi-load energy harvesting systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power management in multi-source multi-load energy harvesting systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"0872epe2009full15015684.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059228S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254890","isNumber":"5278662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254890","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5278662","articleId":"5279327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5279334,"authors":[{"name":"Mouna Bejaoui","affiliation":["L.

The paper is centered on an Improved Three-Monophase (ITM) method and a novel one called Two-Phase Flow (TPF) method for detecting harmonics from disturbed currents due to non linear loads in electric power systems. The TPF method introduces new currents decomposition in the DQ-space that results in separating AC from DC components. The DC terms are estimated by an Adaline Neural Network because of its learning capabilities with respect to real-time applications. Then the resulting AC terms from this approach are transformed to obtain the reference currents.

Results show high compression ratios while preserving the quality (quantitative and visual aspects) and the energy of the signal and detection of sudden changes are achievable.","doi":"10.1109/ICSNC.2009.70","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279351/5279352/05279364.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSNC.2009.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Wavelets for Compression and Detecting Events in Anomalous Network Traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279364/","displayDocTitle":"Using Wavelets for Compression and Detecting Events in Anomalous Network Traffic","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906744","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279364/","conferenceDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Wavelets for Compression and Detecting Events in Anomalous Network Traffic","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3775a195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062707S","chronDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279351","isNumber":"5279352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279351","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5279352","articleId":"5279364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5279367,"authors":[{"name":"Tuomas Tirronen","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Networking TKK, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Tuomas","lastName":"Tirronen","id":"37089049038"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4772-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3775-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-9019"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-9027"}],"articleNumber":"5279367","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":92},"abstract":"We study a packet erasure correction method based on biased sampling in a sliding window. This kind of coding works especially well for streaming data, where the data have real-time requirements and expire after sometime. The coding method resembles fountain coding but we allow biased sampling of the source blocks inside the window. We present an exact Markov model for analyzing the erasure correction performance and use Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution for calculating the erasure correction probability of a specified sampling pattern. The model is derived for independent packet erasures, and the sender is assumed to have an estimate on the erasure probability. We truncate the state space in order to lower the computational complexity by limiting the number of allowable erasures within the window, and study scenarios with low channel erasure probability and small window size. The optimal sampling weights are searched and the results suggest that a deterministic sampling pattern isoptimal in the depicted scenario. A comparison to state-of-the-art Raptor codes for a similar setting reveals improved erasure correction performance with the proposed method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Streaming media","Iterative decoding","Performance analysis","Probability","State-space methods","Telecommunication traffic","Feedback","Iterative algorithms","Pattern analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","Markov processes","media streaming","packet radio networks","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sliding window-based erasure correction","biased sampling","packet erasure correction method","data streaming","coding method","fountain coding","source blocks","Markov model","Wallenius noncentral hypergeometric distribution","erasure correction probability","independent packet erasures","state space","deterministic sampling pattern","Raptor codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["performance analysis","erasure coding","real-time traffic","fountain coding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSNC.2009.93","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279351/5279352/05279367.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSNC.2009.93","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sliding Window-Based Erasure Correction Using Biased Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sliding Window-Based Erasure Correction Using Biased Sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279367/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279367/","accessionNumber":"10906747","conferenceDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sliding Window-Based Erasure Correction Using Biased Sampling","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3775a144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053312S","chronDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279351","isNumber":"5279352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279351","xplore-issue":"5279352","articleId":"5279367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5279382,"authors":[{"name":"Hugo Lima","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Aveiro University, Aveiro, Portugal","Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, UA Campo Universit\u00e1rio, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Hugo","lastName":"Lima","id":"37530355100"},{"name":"Andreia Moco","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, UA Campo Universit\u00e1rio, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Andreia","lastName":"Moco","id":"37860277500"},{"name":"Ad\u00e3o Silva","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Aveiro University, Aveiro, Portugal","Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, UA Campo Universit\u00e1rio, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ad\u00e3o","lastName":"Silva","id":"37401627600"},{"name":"At\u00edlio Gameiro","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Aveiro University, Aveiro, Portugal","Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, UA Campo Universit\u00e1rio, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"At\u00edlio","lastName":"Gameiro","id":"37270506000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4772-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3775-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-9019"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-9027"}],"articleNumber":"5279382","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","OFDM","Antenna arrays","Mobile antennas","Base stations","Protocols","Decoding","WiMAX","Availability","Cooperative systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","mobile radio","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna relays","uplink OFDM systems","cooperative schemes","mobile relays","antenna array","base station","user terminal","relaying-able terminals","relay assisted protocols","equalize-and-forward","decode-and-forward","WiMAX specifications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","relay","multiple antennas","cooperative schemes and uplink."]}],"abstract":"The aim of this paper is to propose and assess the performance of cooperative schemes designed for the uplink OFDM based systems with mobile relays with an antenna array. We consider the use of an antenna array at the base station and a single antenna at the user terminal. We compare the situations at which the relay is equipped with one or two antennas. We assume that some of the user terminals deployed in a certain area could act as relaying-able terminals for the communication of other users. Two types of relay assisted protocols are considered: equalize-and-forward and decode-and-forward. The performance of the proposed relay-assisted schemes is evaluated under realistic scenarios, considering typical pedestrian scenarios based on WiMAX specifications. The proposed schemes are also compared against the OFDM based non-cooperative systems. Numerical results show that the availability of antenna arrays at the relays significantly improves the cooperative systems performance, which outperform the non-cooperative ones in all studied scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ICSNC.2009.94","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279351/5279352/05279382.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSNC.2009.94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Assessment of Single and Multiple Antenna Relays for the Uplink OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279382/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Assessment of Single and Multiple Antenna Relays for the Uplink OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906762","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279382/","conferenceDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Assessment of Single and Multiple Antenna Relays for the Uplink OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3775a076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052987S","chronDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279351","isNumber":"5279352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279351","xplore-issue":"5279352","articleId":"5279382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5279391,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Di Carlo","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Piemonte, IT"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Di Carlo","id":"37296346000"},{"name":"Paolo Prinetto","affiliation":["Control and Computer Engineering Department, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Prinetto","id":"37323155800"},{"name":"Alberto Scionti","affiliation":["Control and Computer Engineering Department, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Scionti","id":"37589696600"},{"name":"Joan Figueras","affiliation":["Departament d'Enginyeria Electronica, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Joan","lastName":"Figueras","id":"37273619400"},{"name":"Salvador Manich","affiliation":["Departament d'Enginyeria Electronica, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Salvador","lastName":"Manich","id":"37329907400"},{"name":"Rosa Rodriguez-Montanes","affiliation":["Departament d'Enginyeria Electronica, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Rosa","lastName":"Rodriguez-Montanes","id":"38276190200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4862-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3774-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5279391","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit testing","Fault diagnosis","Circuit faults","System testing","Costs","Microprocessors","Integrated circuit testing","Computer aided manufacturing","SRAM chips","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic testing","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-cost FPGA-based testing","SRAM circuit diagnosis architecture","next-generation integrated circuits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Memory Diagnosis","Memory Testing","March Test"]}],"abstract":"The continues improvement of manufacturing technologies allows the realization of integrated circuits containing an ever increasing number of transistors.

Performance verification of the physical layer (PHY) of wireless communication networks under various radio propagation conditions is a computationally-daunting process. Bit-true software-based simulation of the PHY layer on workstations is becoming prohibitively time-consuming. This makes hardware-accelerated prototyping and verification of the PHY layer an increasingly attractive alternative. This paper presents a bit error rate tester (BERT) for baseband performance verification of multiple antenna (MIMO) systems over accurate radio propagation channel models. This BERT integrates all of the required modules of a typical PHY layer onto a single field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The proposed BERT system significantly decreases the test time compared to conventional software-based verification, hence increasing designer productivity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Advances in System Testing and Validation Lifecycle","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279389/5279390/05279408.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"140","publicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Advances in System Testing and Validation Lifecycle","doi":"10.1109/VALID.2009.21","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VALID.2009.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279390","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Accelerated Baseband Design and Verification of Broadband MIMO Wireless Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Baseband","MIMO","Physical layer","Bit error rate","Radio propagation","System testing","Field programmable gate arrays","Costs","Time to market","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadband networks","error statistics","field programmable gate arrays","MIMO communication","radiowave propagation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-accelerated baseband design","broadband MIMO wireless system verification","communication system design","the physical layer","wireless communication network","bit-true software-based simulation","workstations","bit error rate tester","multiple antenna systems","radio propagation channel models","single field-programmable gate array","software-based verification","BERT system","multiple input multiple output communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Accelerated Baseband Design and Verification of Broadband MIMO Wireless Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279408/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906788","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","conferenceDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Accelerated Baseband Design and Verification of Broadband MIMO Wireless Systems","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3774a135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068204S","chronDate":"20-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279389","isNumber":"5279390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279389","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5279390","articleId":"5279408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5279435,"authors":[{"name":"Jaewoo So","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaewoo","lastName":"So","id":"37293500300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4679-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5279435","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Traffic control","Analytical models","Resource management","Media Access Protocol","Broadcasting","Frequency conversion","Modulation coding","Downlink","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","Internet telephony","OFDM modulation","protocols","resource allocation","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","semifixed mapping scheme","VoIP traffic services","wireless OFDMA system","resource assignment","voice-over-Internet protocol","orthogonal frequency division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mapping overhead","VoIP","resource allocation","WiMAX","IEEE 802.16e"]}],"abstract":"Informing users about new resource assignments has to be broadcast, thus generating a substantial amount of the mapping overhead that influences the system throughput.

In order to reduce the mapping overhead, a semi-fixed mapping scheme based on the periodicity of VoIP traffic was introduced.

However, current methods for narrowband noise suppression are either very time-consuming or adding distortion to the signal received. In this paper, a fast resampling method and an adaptive Gaussian wavelet filter with optimal time-frequency localisation and variable bandwidth is proposed to suppress single and multiple narrowband noise that interferes with spread spectrum signals in the frequency domain. The filtering and resampling is computationally efficient such that it can be used for real-time implementation. A method by conducting magnitude spectral analysis on received signals in a detection channel is employed to determine which frequency contents in the spectral analysis output contain the interfering narrowband signals. Experimental work has demonstrated that the proposed resampling and wavelet filter reduces narrowband noise efficiently and improves signal to noise ratio (SNR) for peak detection leading to higher accuracy of timing measurement for wireless positioning.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWMC.2009.9","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279431/5279432/05279438.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","doi":"10.1109/ICWMC.2009.9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Resampling and Denoising of Spread Spectrum Signal for Real-Time Wireless Location","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fast Resampling and Denoising of Spread Spectrum Signal for Real-Time Wireless Location","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5279438/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906814","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279438/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Resampling and Denoising of Spread Spectrum Signal for Real-Time Wireless Location","confLoc":"Cannes/La Bocca, France","sourcePdf":"3750a007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047502S","chronDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279431","isNumber":"5279432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279431","xplore-issue":"5279432","articleId":"5279438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5279442,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Ismail Muhammad","affiliation":["ECE Department, Misr International University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Muhammad Ismail","lastName":"Muhammad","id":"38284045900"},{"name":"Abdel Aziz M.

Classifiers for human activity recognition are built exploring a space of candidate feature subsets, trying to maximize the accuracy of a classifier trained with them. At the same time, the size of the selected feature subset is minimized. The accuracy of a classifier tends to grow with the number of features, but in a real time task, like human activity recognition, the number of features used has to be minimized, because its growing involves a slower processing rate. A set of solutions with different trade-offs between accuracy and number of features may be achieved modeling the problem of feature selection using multiobjective optimization (MO), where both measures are optimized at the same time. To solve the MO problem, multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) are going to be used. MOEA methods based on Pareto dominance not only find an optimal solution for the problem, they find a set of different optimal solutions so called Pareto-optimal set. A set of activity recognizers of different complexities is found using this approach. Having a set of different solutions allows the designer to choose the one that best fits its requirements. The method will be applied using a hidden Markov model as classifier. Results of the use of the method for recognizing different instantaneous human activities are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906883","htmlLink":"/document/5279445/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Creating Human Activity Recognition Systems Using Pareto-based Multiobjective Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Creating Human Activity Recognition Systems Using Pareto-based Multiobjective Optimization","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"3718a037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11299S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279443","isNumber":"5279444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279443","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5279444","articleId":"5279445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5279453,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The pulse shaping investigated achieved high data rates by being overlapped in the time domain, equalisation was then used to suppress the resulting intersymbol interference. Our finding after researching a number of pulses is that the harris-moerder pulse was the most successful.

We show that the PSD of the CDMA signal depends primarily on the PSD of the assigned Walsh functions. Also, based on the Walsh code properties, an algorithm for Walsh code assignment in CDMA systems is introduced. The algorithm achieves lower spectral regrowth in terms of adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) at all values of input back off (IBO). Performance measurements show that using such an algorithm for 17 active channels, a reduction of about 6 dB and 5 dB in the ACPR is achieved at IBO = 1 dB and 2 dB, respectively. This reduction in the spectral regrowth implies that using this algorithm, the high power amplifier (HPA) can operate at high values of input power approaching the saturation level with minimal spectral regrowth, and in turn the HPA efficiency is improved.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279431/5279432/05279537.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"184","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICWMC.2009.37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWMC.2009.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279432","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Power Amplifier Efficiency via Walsh Code Assignment in Synchronous CDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Code division multiplexing","Peak to average power ratio","Multiaccess communication","High power amplifiers","Dynamic range","Downlink","Interference","Probability distribution","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","codes","power amplifiers","Walsh functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous CDMA systems","power amplifier efficiency","Walsh code assignment","Walsh function","power spectral density","adjacent channel power ratio","input back off","active channels","minimal spectral regrowth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","Walsh codes","PAR","ACPR","spectral regrowth"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improved Power Amplifier Efficiency via Walsh Code Assignment in Synchronous CDMA Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279537/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906842","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","conferenceDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Power Amplifier Efficiency via Walsh Code Assignment in Synchronous CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Cannes/La Bocca, France","sourcePdf":"3750a179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051638S","chronDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279431","isNumber":"5279432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279431","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5279432","articleId":"5279537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5279546,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Wu","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Network Research, School of Computing, Communications & Electronics, University of Plymouth, UK"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Wu","id":"38277203700"},{"name":"Mosa Ali Abu-Rgheff","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Network Research, School of Computing, Communications & Electronics, University of Plymouth, UK"],"firstName":"Mosa Ali","lastName":"Abu-Rgheff","id":"38276207400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4679-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5279546","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Mobile communication","Bit error rate","Bit rate","Wireless communication","Computer networks","Fading","Downlink","Frequency conversion","Frequency division multiaccess"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","error statistics","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sub-optimal subcarrier allocation","multiuser OFDM system","total transmit power","bit error rate","user data rate","frequency division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiuser OFDM","Subcarrier Allocation"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the allocation of subcarriers and power in the downlink channels of multiuser OFDM systems.

The objective is to improve system performance by increasing data throughput or decreasing power requirements, when compared with pilot based conventional channel estimation techniques. The constant modulus algorithm and the soft decision-directed technique were concurrently employed to adjust the coefficients of a post-FFT equalizer bank. The algorithm works in a semi-blind mode because it uses channel information, obtained from pilot subcarriers, to initialize and to supervise the equalizer bank when pilots are present, otherwise remaining blind in the equalization process. To support such a concurrent equalization, the system should provide pilot subcarriers only in the first symbol of each OFDM super-frame, allowing algorithm initialization when the receiver is turned on. In the remaining super-frame symbols, pilot subcarriers can be suppressed to increase the overall system throughput.","doi":"10.1109/ICWMC.2009.43","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279431/5279432/05279559.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWMC.2009.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Semi-blind Frequency-Domain Concurrent Equalizer for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279559/","displayDocTitle":"A Semi-blind Frequency-Domain Concurrent Equalizer for OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906848","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279559/","conferenceDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Semi-blind Frequency-Domain Concurrent Equalizer for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Cannes/La Bocca, France","sourcePdf":"3750a211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057975S","chronDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279431","isNumber":"5279432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279431","xplore-issue":"5279432","articleId":"5279559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5279560,"authors":[{"name":"Olga Sourina","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Olga","lastName":"Sourina","id":"37282373000"},{"name":"Nikolay Korolev","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Nikolay","lastName":"Korolev","id":"37282374100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4864-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3791-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5279560","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Shape","Sequences","Data mining","Animation","DNA","Solid modeling","Electronic mail","Analytical models","Information retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","geometry","Internet","molecular dynamics method","physics computing","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual query interface","molecular dynamics application","visual data mining","World Wide Web","spatiotemporal queries","visual spatio-temporal query interface","molecular visual dynamics query system","molecular dynamics file","geometric shapes","geometric objects","time-dependent parameters","spatiotemporal range query","spatiotemporal query","animated sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["visual query","molecular dynamics","visual interfaces"]}],"abstract":"Visual data mining opens new possibilities for scientific research on the Web.

The atoms coordinates or the distance between atoms can be chosen as time-dependent parameters of the query solid that defines the shape of the spatio-temporal range query. Then, the resulting region inside the spatio-temporal query is visualized as an animated sequence or frame-by-frame. The system application in analysis of molecular dynamics simulation results is discussed. The temporal range queries in our model can be considered as motion classifiers.

Peak to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) is a very well known measure of the envelope fluctuations and has become the cost function used to evaluate and design multicarrier systems. Several PAPR reduction techniques have been proposed with the aim to increase the system performance. Besides the fact that these techniques have varying PAPR-reduction performance, most previous studies haven't considered the loss of performance due to the average transmit power variation. In this paper, the Overall Performance (OP) due to PAPR reduction of clipping, Tone Reservation(TR) and Active Constellation Extension (ACE) techniques in the presence of a HPA is investigated by evaluating a figure of merit which takes account the PAPR-reduction performance, the average power variation and the in-band distortion. Based on this figure-of-merit OP, simulation results show that, TR is the best, followed by ACE and followed from afar by clipping.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279431/5279432/05279562.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"222","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICWMC.2009.44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWMC.2009.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279432","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Figure-of-Merit for Evaluating the Overall Performance of OFDM PAPR Reduction Techniques in the Presence of High Power Amplifier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Peak to average power ratio","High power amplifiers","Fluctuations","System performance","Performance loss","Frequency division multiplexing","Power measurement","Cost function","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","radiofrequency amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["figure-of-merit","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","high power amplifier","envelope fluctuations","PAPR reduction","tone reservation","active constellation extension"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)","Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR)","Overall Performance (OP)","High Power Amplifier (HPA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Figure-of-Merit for Evaluating the Overall Performance of OFDM PAPR Reduction Techniques in the Presence of High Power Amplifier","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279562/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906849","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","conferenceDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Figure-of-Merit for Evaluating the Overall Performance of OFDM PAPR Reduction Techniques in the Presence of High Power Amplifier","confLoc":"Cannes/La Bocca, France","sourcePdf":"3750a217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060307S","chronDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279431","isNumber":"5279432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279431","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5279432","articleId":"5279562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5279567,"authors":[{"name":"Ebru S.

In the proposed system, the worst relay according to a chosen criterion is cancelled while the remaining ones utilize beamforming. Both theoretical analysis, and experimental comparisons in bit error rate (BER) performance are given for the proposed system and the system where all relays are active. The scheme which cancels the worst relay achieves full diversity order which is demonstrated through outage probability (OP) upper bound. The derivation of the OP upper bound is carried out using order statistics. Simulations are performed for various numbers of relays and differential signal to noise ratios (DSNR) which are the differences in SNR between source-relay and relay-destination channels. This way, the full diversity order of the proposed system is validated experimentally. Moreover, it is observed that the proposed system achieves better performance in BER compared to the system with no cancellation.","doi":"10.1109/ICWMC.2009.45","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279431/5279432/05279567.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWMC.2009.45","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","startPage":"223","endPage":"227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Analysis in a Cooperative System with Beamforming and Worst Relay Cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Outage Analysis in a Cooperative System with Beamforming and Worst Relay Cancellation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279567/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279567/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906850","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","conferenceDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Analysis in a Cooperative System with Beamforming and Worst Relay Cancellation","confLoc":"Cannes/La Bocca, France","sourcePdf":"3750a223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110272S","chronDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279431","isNumber":"5279432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279431","xplore-issue":"5279432","articleId":"5279567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5279570,"authors":[{"name":"Subhash Mishra","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology, Bhopal, India"],"firstName":"Subhash","lastName":"Mishra","id":"38103102200"},{"name":"R.

CCI is one of the most significant factors limiting the capacity and scalability of wireless networks. Various techniques such as power control, antenna down tilting, cell sectoring and multiple antennas have been in use for combating CCI. Smart antenna techniques which use antenna arrays with signal processing offer significant increase in throughput, signal range, interference reduction and system capacity improvements. Neural networks , once trained and validated, are not only capable of performing computationally complex signal processing but also can track sources in real time and are nonlinear in nature. These characteristics make them suitable for smart antenna design. In this review a study of neural network techniques applicable for smart antenna design and CCI reduction is presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279570/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10906851","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279570/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","conferenceDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Networks in Smart Antenna Design for Co-channel Interference (CCI) Reduction: A Review","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Networks in Smart Antenna Design for Co-channel Interference (CCI) Reduction: A Review","confLoc":"Cannes/La Bocca, France","sourcePdf":"3750a228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108879S","chronDate":"23-29 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279431","isNumber":"5279432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279431","xplore-issue":"5279432","articleId":"5279570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5279578,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As clouds are made interoperable, federations of clouds may be formed. Such federations are from the point of view of the user not burdened by vendor lock-in, and opens for business possibilities where a market place of cloud computing infrastructure can be formed. Federated clouds require unified management interfaces regarding the virtual machines (VMs) that comprise the services running in the cloud federation. Standardization efforts for the required management interfaces have so far focused on definition of description formats regarding VMs, and the control of already deployed VMs. We propose technology neutral interfaces and architectural additions for handling placement, migration, and monitoring of VMs in federated cloud environments, the latter as an extension of current monitoring architectures used in grid computing. The interfaces presented adhere to the general requirements of scalability, efficiency, and security in addition to specific requirements related to the particular issues of interoperability and business relationships between competing cloud computing infrastructure providers. In addition, they may be used equally well locally and remotely, creating a layer of abstraction that simplifies management of virtualized service components.","publicationTitle":"2009 Eighth International Conference on Grid and Cooperative Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Eighth International Conference on Grid and Cooperative Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279485/5279486/05279590.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"260","doi":"10.1109/GCC.2009.36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCC.2009.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interfaces for Placement, Migration, and Monitoring of Virtual Machines in Federated Clouds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Interfaces for Placement, Migration, and Monitoring of Virtual Machines in Federated Clouds","htmlLink":"/document/5279590/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10906262","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interfaces for Placement, Migration, and Monitoring of Virtual Machines in Federated Clouds","confLoc":"Lanzhou, China","sourcePdf":"3766a253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070983S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279485","isNumber":"5279486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279485","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5279486","articleId":"5279590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5279616,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Tian","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Tian","id":"37593232800"},{"name":"Haojie Zhou","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haojie","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37655897100"},{"name":"Yongqiang He","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yongqiang","lastName":"He","id":"37710162500"},{"name":"Li Zha","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zha","id":"37287254700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3766-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4916"}],"articleNumber":"5279616","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":101,"citationCountPatent":17,"totalDownloads":1896},"abstract":"MapReduce is an important programming model for building data centers containing ten of thousands of nodes. In a practical data center of that scale, it is a common case that I/O-bound jobs and CPU-bound jobs, which demand different resources, run simultaneously in the same cluster. In the MapReduce framework, parallelization of these two kinds of job has not been concerned. In this paper, we give a new view of the MapReduce model, and classify the MapReduce workloads into three categories based on their CPU and I/O utilization. With workload classification, we design a new dynamic MapReduce workload predict mechanism, MR-Predict, which detects the workload type on the fly. We propose a Triple-Queue Scheduler based on the MR-Predict mechanism. The Triple-Queue scheduler could improve the usage of both CPU and disk I/O resources under heterogeneous workloads. And it could improve the Hadoop throughput by about 30% under heterogeneous workloads.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Eighth International Conference on Grid and Cooperative Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279485/5279486/05279616.pdf","startPage":"218","endPage":"224","publicationTitle":"2009 Eighth International Conference on Grid and Cooperative Computing","doi":"10.1109/GCC.2009.19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCC.2009.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dynamic MapReduce Scheduler for Heterogeneous Workloads","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic scheduling","Throughput","Dynamic programming","Hardware","Web and internet services","Grid computing","Processor scheduling","Chaos","Helium","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic MapReduce scheduler","heterogeneous workload","data center","I/O-bound job","CPU-bound job","CPU utilization","I/O utilization","workload classification","Triple-Queue Scheduler","MR-Predict mechanism","resource usage","Hadoop throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MapReduce","Schdule","heterogeneous workloads"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Dynamic MapReduce Scheduler for Heterogeneous Workloads","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279616/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906271","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamic MapReduce Scheduler for Heterogeneous Workloads","confLoc":"Lanzhou, China","sourcePdf":"3766a218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101173S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279485","isNumber":"5279486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279485","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"5279486","articleId":"5279616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5279619,"authors":[{"name":"Torbj\u00f6rn Wigren","affiliation":["WCDMA System Management, Ericsson AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Torbj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Wigren","id":"37284683400"},{"name":"Jenni Wennervirta","affiliation":["Research & Development Center Finland, Oy L M Ericsson AB, Jorvas, Finland"],"firstName":"Jenni","lastName":"Wennervirta","id":"37974455400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4679-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5279619","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":541},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Delay","Position measurement","Global Positioning System","Base stations","Costs","Radio network","Time measurement","Velocity measurement","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","radio direction-finding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RTT positioning algorithm","round trip time positioning algorithm","WCDMA","computed cell polygon","radio base station","wideband code division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["localization","navigation","polygon","positioning","round trip time","WCDMA"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents the details of a round trip time (RTT) positioning algorithm that provides a largely improved accuracy as compared to cell ID positioning - yet with an availability above 95% and a typical response time below 0.3 s.

DABC-NV has four salient features. First, it allocates buffer cache space to MLC and SLC flash memories based on their I/O costs and then dynamically adjusts the allocated size according to the evolution of workloads. Second, it separately exploits read and write histories of block references, and thus it estimates future references of each operation more precisely. Third, it guarantees the complete consistency of write I/Os since all dirty data are cached in nonvolatile buffer caches. Fourth, metadata lists are maintained separately from cached blocks. This allows more efficient management of volatile and nonvolatile buffer caches based on read and write histories, respectively. Trace-driven simulations show that DABC-NV improves the I/O performance of embedded systems significantly. Specifically, it reduces I/O time by 24% on average compared to the CLOCK-NV algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.2009.32","publicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279621/5279622/05279644.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2009.32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Buffer Cache Management for Combined MLC and SLC Flash Memories Using both Volatile and Nonvolatile RAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Buffer Cache Management for Combined MLC and SLC Flash Memories Using both Volatile and Nonvolatile RAMs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279644/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10939084","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Buffer Cache Management for Combined MLC and SLC Flash Memories Using both Volatile and Nonvolatile RAMs","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3787a228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089608S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279621","isNumber":"5279622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279621","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5279622","articleId":"5279644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5279665,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Saglam","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, M.E.T.U., Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Saglam","id":"38248188000"},{"name":"Alptekin Temizel","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, M.E.T.U., Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Alptekin","lastName":"Temizel","id":"37393040900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4755-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3718-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5279665","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":837},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Video surveillance","Focusing","Image edge detection","Computational efficiency","Adaptive signal detection","Informatics","Lenses","Adaptive algorithm","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alarm systems","real-time systems","video cameras","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time adaptive camera tamper detection","video surveillance","real-time automated detection","video camera tampering","camera lens","automated camera tamper detection","adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["video surveillance","camera tampering","camera sabotage","covered camera","defocused camera","moved camera"]}],"abstract":"Criminals often resort to camera tampering to prevent capture of their actions. Real-time automated detection of video camera tampering cases is important for timely warning of the operators. Tampering is generally done by obstructing the camera view by a foreign object, displacing the camera and changing the focus of the camera lens. In automated camera tamper detection systems, low false alarm rates are important as reliability of these systems is compromised by unnecessary alarms and consequently the operators start ignoring the warnings. We propose adaptive algorithms to detect and identify such cases with low false alarms rates in typical surveillance scenarios where there is significant activity in the scene.","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2009.29","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279443/5279444/05279665.pdf","startPage":"430","endPage":"435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2009.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Adaptive Camera Tamper Detection for Video Surveillance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279665/","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Adaptive Camera Tamper Detection for Video Surveillance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906918","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279665/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Adaptive Camera Tamper Detection for Video Surveillance","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"3718a430.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03899S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279443","isNumber":"5279444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279443","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5279444","articleId":"5279665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5279666,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper we propose a new coding scheme suitable for video surveillance applications that allows tracking of video objects without the need to reconstruct the sequence,thus enabling privacy protection. By taking advantage of recent findings in the compressive sensing literature, we encode a video sequence with a limited number of pseudo-random projections of each frame. At the decoder, we exploit the sparsity that characterizes background subtracted images in order to recover the location of the foreground object. We also leverage the prior knowledge about the estimated location of the object, which is predicted by means of a particle filter, to improve the recovery of the foreground object location. The proposed framework enables privacy, in the sense it is impossible to reconstruct the original video content from the encoded random projections alone, as well as secrecy, since decoding is prevented if the seed used to generate the random projections is not available.","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2009.13","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279443/5279444/05279666.pdf","startPage":"436","endPage":"441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2009.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-Enabled Object Tracking in Video Sequences Using Compressive Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279666/","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-Enabled Object Tracking in Video Sequences Using Compressive Sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906919","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279666/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-Enabled Object Tracking in Video Sequences Using Compressive Sensing","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"3718a436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089109S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279443","isNumber":"5279444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279443","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5279444","articleId":"5279666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5279667,"authors":[{"name":"Bogdan Kwolek","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Rzesz\u00f3w University of Technology, Rzeszow, Poland"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Kwolek","id":"37274843800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4755-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3718-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5279667","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279667","abstract":"In this paper a particle swarm optimization based algorithm for object tracking in surveillance videos is proposed. Given the estimate of the object state, the particles are drawn from a Gaussian distribution in order to cover the promising object locations. The particle swarm optimization takes place afterwards in order to concentrate the particles near the true state of the object. The optimization aims at shifting the particles towards more promising regions in the search area. The region covariance is utilized in evaluation of the particle score. The object template is represented by multiple object patches. Every patch votes for the considered position of the object undergoing tracking. Owing to robust combining of such patch votes the object tracker is able to cope with considerable partial occlusions. A tracking algorithm built on the covariance score can recover after substantial temporal occlusions or large movements. Through the usage of multi-patch object representation the algorithm posses better recovery capabilities and it recovers earlier. Experimental results that were obtained in a typical office environment as well as surveillance videos show the feasibility of our approach, especially when the object undergoing tracking has a rapid motion or the occlusions are considerable. The resulting algorithm runs in real-time on a standard computer.","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2009.19","startPage":"418","endPage":"423","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279443/5279444/05279667.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2009.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object Tracking via Multi-region Covariance and Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle tracking","Particle swarm optimization","Surveillance","State estimation","Voting","Robustness","Optimization methods","Stochastic processes","State-space methods","Particle filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance analysis","Gaussian distribution","image representation","object detection","particle swarm optimisation","target tracking","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object tracking","multi-region covariance","particle swarm optimization","video surveillance","Gaussian distribution","object template","object patches","multipatch object representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["target tracking","particle swarm optimization","region covariance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Object Tracking via Multi-region Covariance and Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279667/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906920","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object Tracking via Multi-region Covariance and Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"3718a418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089162S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279443","isNumber":"5279444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279443","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5279444","articleId":"5279667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5279684,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Waheed","affiliation":["Multimedia Communication Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Waheed","id":"37392846000"},{"name":"Anni Cai","affiliation":["Multimedia Communication Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Anni","lastName":"Cai","id":"37267103300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4679-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5279684","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279684","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Ant colony optimization","Chromium","Wireless communication","Mobile communication","Genetic algorithms","Multimedia communication","Interference","FCC","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio parameter adaptation","dynamic multicarrier environment","transmission parameter adaptation","binary ant colony optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio (CR)","multiobjective optimization","binary ant colony optimimzation (BACO)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICWMC.2009.72","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279431/5279432/05279684.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWMC.2009.72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio Parameter Adaptation in Multicarrier Environment","abstract":"Transmission parameter adaptation in a dynamic multicarrier environment is a challenging task for cognitive radio.

Moreover, systems with multiple heterogeneous processing units have been widely adopted to enhance the computing capability or reduce the power consumption. This work explores how to synthesize a heterogeneous multiprocessor platform or select processing units with the partitioning of real-time tasks so that the energy consumption is minimized. Given a set of processing unit types, characterized by the power consumption for maintaining activeness and executing jobs, this paper proposes an efficient and effective algorithm to allocate processing units with energy-efficient task partitioning. We show that the algorithm is with a (1+ ln n)-approximation factor, in worst cases, for processing unit types with a variety of power consumption models, where n is the number of tasks. The approximation factor is asymptotically optimal for polynomial-time approximation algorithms unless P = NP. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective for energy consumption minimization.","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.2009.48","publicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279621/5279622/05279703.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2009.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279622","startPage":"393","endPage":"402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task Partitioning and Platform Synthesis for Energy Efficiency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Task Partitioning and Platform Synthesis for Energy Efficiency","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279703/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906318","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5279703/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task Partitioning and Platform Synthesis for Energy Efficiency","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3787a393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073347S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279621","isNumber":"5279622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279621","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5279622","articleId":"5279703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5279717,"authors":[{"name":"Hongchao Fang","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hongchao","lastName":"Fang","id":"38102680500"},{"name":"Soh Khim Ong","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Soh Khim","lastName":"Ong","id":"38181934100"},{"name":"Andrew Yeh-Ching Nee","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Andrew Yeh-Ching","lastName":"Nee","id":"37272189900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4864-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3791-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5279717","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1140},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279717","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot programming","Augmented reality","Service robots","Human robot interaction","Educational robots","Intelligent robots","Trajectory","Process planning","Education","Virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["augmented reality","control engineering computing","human-robot interaction","image registration","path planning","robot programming","robot vision","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-robot interaction issues","industrial robots","augmented reality based robot programming process","virtual robot","real robot","robot trajectory planning process","task planning","task execution","stereo vision-based methodologies","virtual objects registration","interactive device position tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Robot Programming","Augmented Reality","Robot Registration","Human-Robot Interaction"]}],"abstract":"Human-robot interaction issues, especially for industrial robots, have largely been confined to finding better ways to reconfigure or program the robots.

It has the advantage of being fully integrated in the Bayesian tracking framework, and reactive as it uses sparse features not explained by tracked objects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5279719/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906932","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Sampling Algorithm for Occlusion Robust Multi Target Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sampling Algorithm for Occlusion Robust Multi Target Detection","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"3718a346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05424S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279443","isNumber":"5279444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279443","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5279444","articleId":"5279719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5279755,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Mayo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Waikato, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Mayo","id":"37317899000"},{"name":"Edmond Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Waikato, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Edmond","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38001187500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4755-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3718-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5279755","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":588},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Clouds","Testing","Face detection","Voting","Surveillance","Computer science","Iterative algorithms","Image databases","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image matching","three-dimensional displays","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D face recognition","multiview keypoint matching","point cloud rotations","multiple projections","voted keypoint matching","multiple 2.5D images","labelled keypoints","face database","GavabDB 3D face recognition dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D Face Recognition","SIFT","Keypoints"]}],"abstract":"A novel algorithm for 3D face recognition based point cloud rotations, multiple projections, and voted keypoint matching is proposed and evaluated. The basic idea is to rotate each 3D point cloud representing an individual's face around the x, y or z axes, iteratively projecting the 3D points onto multiple 2.5D images at each step of the rotation. Labeled keypoints are then extracted from the resulting collection of 2.5D images, and this much smaller set of keypoints replaces the original face scan and its projections in the face database. Unknown test faces are recognized firstly by performing the same multiview keypoint extraction technique, and secondly, the application of a new weighted keypoint matching algorithm. In an extensive evaluation using the GavabDB 3D face recognition dataset (61 subjects, 9 scans per subject), our method achieves up to 95% recognition accuracy for faces with neutral expressions only, and over 90% accuracy for face recognition where expressions (such as a smile or a strong laugh) and random face-occluding gestures are permitted.","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2009.11","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279443/5279444/05279755.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2009.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279444","startPage":"290","endPage":"295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Face Recognition Using Multiview Keypoint Matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3D Face Recognition Using Multiview Keypoint Matching","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279755/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10961952","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5279755/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Face Recognition Using Multiview Keypoint Matching","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"3718a290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075534S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279443","isNumber":"5279444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279443","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5279444","articleId":"5279755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5279762,"authors":[{"name":"Pascal Paysan","affiliation":["Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Paysan","id":"38111782400"},{"name":"Reinhard Knothe","affiliation":["Switzerland"],"firstName":"Reinhard","lastName":"Knothe","id":"38094479900"},{"name":"Brian Amberg","affiliation":["Switzerland"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Amberg","id":"37829211300"},{"name":"Sami Romdhani","affiliation":["Switzerland"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Romdhani","id":"37332051400"},{"name":"Thomas Vetter","affiliation":["Switzerland"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Vetter","id":"37281818300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4755-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3718-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5279762","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":433,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":4294},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279762","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Face recognition","Face detection","Shape","Image sensors","Power generation","Computer vision","Costs","Image analysis","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","face recognition","image reconstruction","image texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D face model","face recognition","pose invariance","illumination invariance","imaging process","computer vision","Basel face model","image reconstruction","3D shape model","texture model","synthesis method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Basel Face Model (BFM)","Morphable Model","generative 3D face models","statistical models","database","2D/3D fitting","recognition","identification"]}],"abstract":"Generative 3D face models are a powerful tool in computer vision. They provide pose and illumination invariance by modeling the space of 3D faces and the imaging process. The power of these models comes at the cost of an expensive and tedious construction process, which has led the community to focus on more easily constructed but less powerful models. With this paper we publish a generative 3D shape and texture model, the Basel face model (BFM), and demonstrate its application to several face recognition task. We improve on previous models by offering higher shape and texture accuracy due to a better scanning device and less correspondence artifacts due to an improved registration algorithm. The same 3D face model can be fit to 2D or 3D images acquired under different situations and with different sensors using an analysis by synthesis method. The resulting model parameters separate pose, lighting, imaging and identity parameters, which facilitates invariant face recognition across sensors and data sets by comparing only the identity parameters. We hope that the availability of this registered face model will spur research in generative models. Together with the model we publish a set of detailed recognition and reconstruction results on standard databases to allow complete algorithm comparisons.","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2009.58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2009.58","startPage":"296","endPage":"301","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279443/5279444/05279762.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3D Face Model for Pose and Illumination Invariant Face Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279762/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A 3D Face Model for Pose and Illumination Invariant Face Recognition","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10906941","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5279762/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3D Face Model for Pose and Illumination Invariant Face Recognition","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"3718a296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08826S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279443","isNumber":"5279444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279443","citationCount":"433","xplore-issue":"5279444","articleId":"5279762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":5279764,"authors":[{"name":"Soheil Samii","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Soheil","lastName":"Samii","id":"37845810900"},{"name":"Yanfei Yin","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden","School of Computer and Communication, Lanzhou University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yanfei","lastName":"Yin","id":"38105716400"},{"name":"Zebo Peng","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Zebo","lastName":"Peng","id":"37278887200"},{"name":"Petru Eles","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Petru","lastName":"Eles","id":"37278884400"},{"name":"Yuanping Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication, Lanzhou University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yuanping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37599081400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3787-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-1271"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"}],"articleNumber":"5279764","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Protocols","Vehicle dynamics","Embedded computing","Delay","Timing","Communication system control","Automotive engineering","Embedded system","Time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive electronics","genetic algorithms","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FlexRay frame identifiers","genetic algorithms","automotive communication protocol","adaptive phase","average response time","task priority assignment","mutation operators","vaccination operator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279764","abstract":"FlexRay is an automotive communication protocol that combines the comprehensive time-triggered paradigm with an adaptive phase that is more suitable for event-based communication.

Fusion possibilities are also discussed and tested using a multimodal database of 130 people designed by the authors. High recognition performance has been obtained by respecting embedded system context, with palmprint only and with fusion of palmprint and face: recognition rates of respectively 96.39% and 98.85% are achieved using only 2 samples per modality. Therefore this preliminary study shows the feasibility of a robust and efficient multimodal hardware biometric system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biometrics","Face

Measurements demonstrated that the DMST technique can be operated continuously over a wide range of supply voltages, from 39.4% to 151.5% (or 212.1%, given device durability) of the nominal supply voltage (3.3 V). The fabricated macros also confirmed that the DMST technique is scalable for various bitline lengths, and offers the same area overhead as conventional sense-tracking-only replica-column schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wide-VDD Embedded SRAM for Dynamic Voltage Asynchronous Systems","doi":"10.1109/MTDT.2009.14","startPage":"20","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MTDT.2009.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279826","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Memory Technology, Design, and Testing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Memory Technology, Design, and Testing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279825/5279826/05279847.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279847","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279847/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Wide-VDD Embedded SRAM for Dynamic Voltage Asynchronous Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279847/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906507","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wide-VDD Embedded SRAM for Dynamic Voltage Asynchronous Systems","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"3797a020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082908S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279825","isNumber":"5279826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279825","xplore-issue":"5279826","articleId":"5279847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5279852,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To exploit the ML approach in the case of phase change memories (PCMs), it is necessary to accurately program the active chalcogenide layer to a number of different partially crystallized states so as to precisely allocate the electrical resistance of the cell in the range from the maximum to the minimum available value. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the characteristics of two voltage-driven programming algorithms, namely, the single-pulse and the (multi-pulse) staircase-up (SCU) programming algorithm, from a ML storage point of view. To this end, we analyze the impact of the amplitude and the time length of applied voltage pulses on the programmed resistance, showing that the SCU algorithm appears to be a promising candidate for PCM ML storage.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Memory Technology, Design, and Testing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Memory Technology, Design, and Testing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279825/5279826/05279852.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage-Driven Multilevel Programming in Phase Change Memories","doi":"10.1109/MTDT.2009.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MTDT.2009.11","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Voltage-Driven Multilevel Programming in Phase Change Memories","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906511","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5279852/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage-Driven Multilevel Programming in Phase Change Memories","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"3797a003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055553S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279825","isNumber":"5279826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279825","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5279826","articleId":"5279852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5279863,"authors":[{"name":"Haobin Shi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Haobin","lastName":"Shi","id":"38106784000"},{"name":"Zhonghua Li","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Zhonghua","lastName":"Li","id":"38106396900"},{"name":"Wenbin Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wenbin","lastName":"Li","id":"38106311800"},{"name":"Zhujun Yu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhujun","lastName":"Yu","id":"38104956400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3778-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5279863","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279863","abstract":"In order to solve the modern logistics problem of vehicle distribution, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on clustering analysis is proposed in this paper. This algorithm clusters the target points in need of distribution primarily by DBSCAN algorithm, and then weighted k-means algorithm is used to cluster the target points finally based on the primary clustering. Corresponding vehicles are allocated to every target cluster according to result of clustering analysis, furthermore, path of vehicles are optimized by use of PSO algorithm until all the distribution tasks are finished. Simulation experiments result shows that PSO algorithm based on clustering analysis is feasible and effective in modern logistics distribution process.","doi":"10.1109/ICMeCG.2009.34","startPage":"291","endPage":"295","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Management of e-Commerce and e-Government","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279723/5279724/05279863.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Management of e-Commerce and e-Government","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMeCG.2009.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Particle Swarm Optimization Based on Clustering Analysis in Logistics Distribution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Logistics","Vehicles","Clustering algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Ant colony optimization","Information analysis","Computer science","Information technology","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["goods distribution","logistics","particle swarm optimisation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","clustering analysis","logistics problem","vehicle distribution","DBSCAN algorithm","weighted k-means algorithm","primary clustering","PSO algorithm","logistics distribution process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["-logistics distribution","particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm","DBSCAN algorithm","weighted k-means algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Application of Particle Swarm Optimization Based on Clustering Analysis in Logistics Distribution","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279863/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906372","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Particle Swarm Optimization Based on Clustering Analysis in Logistics Distribution","confLoc":"Nanchang, China","sourcePdf":"3778a291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056548S","chronDate":"16-19 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279723","isNumber":"5279724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279723","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5279724","articleId":"5279863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5279972,"authors":[{"name":"Tomoya Kitani","affiliation":["Shizuoka University, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoya","lastName":"Kitani","id":"37395029600"},{"name":"Ryo Nakahashi","affiliation":["Osaka University, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryo","lastName":"Nakahashi","id":"38299112800"},{"name":"Khaled El-Fakih","affiliation":["American University of Sharjah, UAE"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"El-Fakih","id":"38310697000"},{"name":"Teruo Higashino","affiliation":["Osaka University, Japan"],"firstName":"Teruo","lastName":"Higashino","id":"37311912800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3787-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-1271"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"}],"articleNumber":"5279972","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279972","abstract":"In this paper, we focus on the problem of implementing a periodic concurrent system with timing constraints into multi-context dynamically reconfigurable processors (DRP). A concurrent system has multiple tasks that can be executed in parallel. Moreover, some tasks in a specific set of processes might be required to synchronize each other. We propose a method for assigning tasks into a multi-context DRP such that timing constraints of the system are satisfied and the size of the program area required on each context for implementing the given system is minimized. We formulate the problem as an ILP problem and propose a heuristic algorithm for solving the ILP problem efficiently. Experimental results and a case study using ubiquitous sensor devices are given.","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.2009.19","startPage":"109","endPage":"118","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5279621/5279622/05279972.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2009.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5279622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Assignment of Real-Time Systems into Multi-context Dynamically Reconfigurable Processors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Timing","Heuristic algorithms","Switches","Computer applications","Concurrent computing","Embedded computing","Context","Multimedia systems","Tree data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","linear programming","multiprocessing systems","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time system","multicontext dynamically reconfigurable processor","periodic concurrent system","timing constraint","ILP problem","heuristic algorithm","integer linear programming","task assignment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["task assignmtask assignment","multi-context dynamically reconfigurable processor","ILP formulation","heuristic approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5279972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Assignment of Real-Time Systems into Multi-context Dynamically Reconfigurable Processors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5279972/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10906343","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Assignment of Real-Time Systems into Multi-context Dynamically Reconfigurable Processors","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3787a109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077143S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5279621","isNumber":"5279622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5279621","xplore-issue":"5279622","articleId":"5279972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5279987,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Belanger","affiliation":["Eurocopter, Marignane, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Belanger","id":"37408061000"},{"name":"Nicolas Favarcq","affiliation":["Eads Test & Services, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Favarcq","id":"38110773100"},{"name":"Yann Fusero","affiliation":["Eads Test & Services, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"Fusero","id":"38100525800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4862-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3774-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5279987","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":96},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Open Real Time Test System Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","System testing","Life testing","Aerospace electronics","Computer architecture","Collaborative work","Programming","International collaboration","Large scale integration","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","avionics","C++ language","program testing","public domain software","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Eurocopter","EADS Test & Services","open real time test system approach","EADS avionic system IDE","collaborative development approach","large scale integration test systems","avionic system management","open standards","innovative plug-in approach","C++ kernel","modular software architecture","open software architecture","zero memory copy mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["U-TEST","EASI","Hardware Abstraction Layer","Model Driven Development","Model Based Testing","Eclipse","real time","plug-in","open source","test system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5279987","abstract":"In 2008, Eurocopter and EADS Test & Services (T&S) jointly started a first project named EASI (EADS avionic system IDE) in order to demonstrate the benefits for the EADS community of a collaborative development approach using an open architecture for large scale integration test systems. The goal is to obtain a tool or a set of tools able to manage avionic systems containing Eurocopter specificities, while sharing development effort of generic components with a large user community. One of the key components of this project is a multi-purpose real-time component dedicated to test systems based on open standards with an innovative plug-in approach and a small C++ kernel as its core.
