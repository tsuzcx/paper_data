Based on the trade-off between energy consumption and transmit power within a cross physical and link layer system model, which jointly considers power allocation, adaptive modulation and coding and ARQ/HARQ retransmission protocols, a transmit power constrained energy minimization problem is formulated. The proposed suboptimal resource allocation algorithm is applied to both cyclic prefix based OFDM (CP-OFDM) and filter bank based multicarrier (FBMC) systems. Due to the absence of CP and the better spectral shaping of subcarriers, the FBMC system can exploit more subcarriers and symbols for data transmission and is less sensitive to carrier frequency offset (CFO), as compared to the CP-OFDM system. These advantages further lead to better QoS provisioning and higher energy efficiency of the former, which are demonstrated by simulation results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An energy efficient downlink resource allocation strategy for multiuser CP-OFDM and FBMC systems","publicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5509122/5518781/05520233.pdf","startPage":"481","endPage":"487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5518781","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5520233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5520233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"An energy efficient downlink resource allocation strategy for multiuser CP-OFDM and FBMC systems","conferenceDate":"31 May-4 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5520233/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11453315","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An energy efficient downlink resource allocation strategy for multiuser CP-OFDM and FBMC systems","confLoc":"Avignon, France","sourcePdf":"p481bai.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047222S","chronDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5509122","isNumber":"5518781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5509122","xplore-issue":"5518781","articleId":"5520233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"INRIA","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5520338,"authors":[{"name":"Eleftherios Karipidis","affiliation":["Communication Systems Division, Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Eleftherios","lastName":"Karipidis","id":"37394029700"},{"name":"Erik G.

Allowing for a precoding operation with arbitrary structure, the feasibility test for multi-carrier systems is analogous to that for MIMO systems with linear transceivers. However, if the precoder is restricted to be applied separately to the different carriers, additional conditions must be fulfilled for feasibility. After stating these conditions, we propose a simple test which is sufficient, but not necessary for feasibility.

It is first shown that methods based on modularity are not appropriate to uncover modules in empirical networks, mainly because modularity optimization has an intrinsic bias towards partitions having a characteristic number of modules which might not be compatible with the modular organization of the system. We argue for the use of more flexible quality functions incorporating a resolution parameter that allows us to reveal the natural scales of the system. Different types of multi-resolution quality functions are described and unified by looking at the partitioning problem from a dynamical viewpoint. Finally, significant values of the resolution parameter are selected by using complementary measures of robustness of the uncovered partitions. The methods are illustrated on a benchmark and an empirical network.","publicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5509122/5518781/05520347.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5518781","startPage":"546","endPage":"553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-scale modularity in complex networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5520347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-scale modularity in complex networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5520347/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 May-4 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11453328","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5520347/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-scale modularity in complex networks","confLoc":"Avignon, France","sourcePdf":"p546lambiotte.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066323S","chronDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5509122","isNumber":"5518781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5509122","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5518781","articleId":"5520347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"INRIA","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5520652,"authors":[{"name":"Christos K.

Our analysis is carried out for systems employing amplify-and-forward channel-state-information-assisted or fixed-gain relays. To assess the statistical properties of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio for both considered systems, we derive novel closed-form expressions for the moment-generating function, the probability density function, and the cumulative distribution function of the product of rational powers of statistically independent squared gamma-gamma random variables. These statistical results are then applied to studying the outage probability and the average bit error probability of binary modulation schemes. Also, for the case of channel-state-information-assisted relays, an accurate asymptotic performance analysis at high SNR values is presented. Numerical examples compare analytical and simulation results, verifying the correctness of the proposed mathematical analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5520652/","volume":"2","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5520652/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11674415","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Serial Free-Space Optical Relaying Communications Over Gamma-Gamma Atmospheric Turbulence Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Serial Free-Space Optical Relaying Communications Over Gamma-Gamma Atmospheric Turbulence Channels","sourcePdf":"576.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087437S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"5571996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5571996","articleId":"5520652","onlineDate":"23 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":5520655,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael A.

Although many AC researchers have traditionally attempted to remain agnostic to the different emotion theories proposed by psychologists, the affective technologies being developed are rife with theoretical assumptions that impact their effectiveness. Hence, an informed and integrated examination of emotion theories from multiple areas will need to become part of computing practice if truly effective real-world systems are to be achieved. This survey discusses theoretical perspectives that view emotions as expressions, embodiments, outcomes of cognitive appraisal, social constructs, products of neural circuitry, and psychological interpretations of basic feelings. It provides meta-analyses on existing reviews of affect detection systems that focus on traditional affect detection modalities like physiology, face, and voice, and also reviews emerging research on more novel channels such as text, body language, and complex multimodal systems. This survey explicitly explores the multidisciplinary foundation that underlies all AC applications by describing how AC researchers have incorporated psychological theories of emotion and how these theories affect research questions, methods, results, and their interpretations. In this way, models and methods can be compared, and emerging insights from various disciplines can be more expertly integrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5520655/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","volume":"1","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11516853","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5520655/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Affect Detection: An Interdisciplinary Review of Models, Methods, and Their Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Affect Detection: An Interdisciplinary Review of Models, Methods, and Their Applications","sourcePdf":"tta2010010018.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.258247S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"5565328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"804","xplore-issue":"5565328","articleId":"5520655","onlineDate":"23 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":5520750,"authors":[{"name":"Serban-Nicolae Meza","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Serban-Nicolae","lastName":"Meza","id":"37547786100"},{"name":"Aurel Vlaicu","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Aurel","lastName":"Vlaicu","id":"37545018100"},{"name":"Bogdan Orza","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Orza","id":"37547718600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6725-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6724-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6723-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5520750","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bridging the gap between video data acquisition, compression and transmission under emerging technologies and scenarios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5520750","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video compression","Data acquisition","Sampling methods","Sparse matrices","Source coding","Size measurement","Video coding","Mathematics","Wireless sensor networks","Analog-digital conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","mobile communication","signal sampling","video coding","video communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video data acquisition","video compression","video transmission","compressive sampling","distributed video coding","3D video","multipurpose wireless mobile device"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed video coding","compressive sampling","3D video","stereo vision","wireless devices"]}],"abstract":"Video data is currently one of the mostly used/desired data that circulates today's digital environment.

The presented theoretical and simulation approaches were tested on a FPGA-based embryonic network architecture (embryonic machine), built with the purpose to implement on silicon fault-tolerant and surviving properties of living organisms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-healing and artificial immune properties implementation upon FPGA-based embryonic network","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Automation, Quality and Testing, Robotics (AQTR)","doi":"10.1109/AQTR.2010.5520808","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Automation, Quality and Testing, Robotics (AQTR)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508864/5520700/05520808.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AQTR.2010.5520808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5520700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5520808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5520808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Self-healing and artificial immune properties implementation upon FPGA-based embryonic network","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5520808/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11453220","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-healing and artificial immune properties implementation upon FPGA-based embryonic network","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"04502792SzaszCsabaSelfhealingandArtificialIm.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059107S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508864","isNumber":"5520700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508864","xplore-issue":"5520700","articleId":"5520808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5520825,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The paper presents a new model design method for the flight control of an autonomous quad rotor. The paper describes the controller architecture for the quadrotor as well. The dynamic model of the quad-rotor, which is an under actuated aircraft with fixed four pitch angle rotors, will be described. The Modeling of a quadrotor vehicle is not an easy task because of its complex structure. The aim is to develop a model of the vehicle as realistic as possible. The model is used to design a stable and accurate controller. This paper explains the developments of a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control method to obtain stability in flying the Quad-rotor flying object. The model has four input forces which are basically the thrust provided by each propeller connected to each rotor with fixed angle. Forward (backward) motion is maintained by increasing (decreasing) speed of front (rear) rotor speed while decreasing (increasing) rear (front) rotor speed simultaneously which means changing the pitch angle. Left and right motion is accomplished by changing roll angle by the same way. The front and rear motors rotate counter-clockwise while other motors rotate clockwise so that the yaw command is derived by increasing (decreasing) counter-clockwise motors speed while decreasing (increasing) clockwise motor speeds.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5520914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11508539","htmlLink":"/document/5520914/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"volume":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modelling and PID controller design for a quadrotor unmanned air vehicle","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling and PID controller design for a quadrotor unmanned air vehicle","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"02803120AltameemiAtheerModellingandPIDControl.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037426S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508864","isNumber":"5520854","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508864","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5520854","articleId":"5520914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":5520965,"authors":[{"name":"Daozhi Xia","affiliation":["Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Daozhi","lastName":"Xia","id":"37288270500"},{"name":"G.

The paper begins with an examination of the high impedance fault problem from the perspective of system protection. The fault detection theory is presented next. The system utilizes a fault-generated increase in the 2-10 kHz component of feeder current for fault detection. EPRI funding enabled the verification and demonstration of this fault detection concept. Measurements were made on several faulted and unfaulted feeders to develop a representative data base of signals to which a relay would be subject. Analysis of these data provided a time and frequency domain signature of these faults. A microcomputer-based prototype relay was constructed and installed on a typical utility feeder.

These characteristics include low-cost, shock-resistivity, non-volatility, power-economy and high density. However, there are two common challenges we need to answer before we can apply non-volatile memory as main memory practically. First, non-volatile memory has limited write/erase cycles compared to DRAM. Second, a write operation is slower than a read operation on non-volatile memory. These two challenges can be answered by reducing the number of write activities on non-volatile main memory. In this paper, we propose two optimization techniques, write-aware scheduling and recomputation, to minimize write activities on non-volatile memory. With the proposed techniques, we can both speed up the completion time of programs and extend non-volatile memory's lifetime. The experimental results show that the proposed techniques can reduce the number of write activities on non-volatile memory by 55.71% on average. Thus, the lifetime of non-volatile memory is extend to 2.5 times as long as before on average. The completion time of programs can be reduced by 55.32% on systems with NOR flash memory and by 40.69% on systems with NAND flash memory on average.","doi":"10.1109/SASP.2010.5521139","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 8th Symposium on Application Specific Processors (SASP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 8th Symposium on Application Specific Processors (SASP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507486/5521134/05521139.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SASP.2010.5521139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5521134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing write activities to non-volatile memory via scheduling and recomputation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-14 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5521139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing write activities to non-volatile memory via scheduling and recomputation","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5521139/","accessionNumber":"11445712","publicationDate":"June 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing write activities to non-volatile memory via scheduling and recomputation","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp18104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117608S","chronDate":"13-14 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507486","isNumber":"5521134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507486","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5521134","articleId":"5521139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5521144,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Shan","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Shan","id":"37534823700"},{"name":"Tianji Wu","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tianji","lastName":"Wu","id":"37534601200"},{"name":"Yu Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293645500"},{"name":"Bo Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538965700"},{"name":"Zilong Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zilong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37537365400"},{"name":"Ningyi Xu","affiliation":["Hardware Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia, China"],"firstName":"Ningyi","lastName":"Xu","id":"37536072200"},{"name":"Huazhong Yang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huazhong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291236500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7954-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7953-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7952-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5521144","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":851},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Large-scale systems","Sparse matrices","High performance computing","Processor scheduling","Hardware","Concurrent computing","Acceleration","Couplings","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","field programmable gate arrays","sparse matrices","task analysis","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","GPU implementation","large scale SpMV","sparse matrix-vector multiplication","very large scale datasets","web link graph analysis","task partition","memory hierarchy","access pattern","compressed sparse row format"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","SpMV","FPGA","AMD GPU","memory hierachy"]}],"abstract":"Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) is a fundamental operation for many applications.

To accelerate the processing of rays, scenes are typically compiled into smaller spatial boxes using a tree structure and rays then traverse the tree structure to determine relevant spatial boxes. This allows computations involving rays and scene objects to be limited to only objects close to the ray and does not require processing all elements in the computer model. We present a ray traversal pipeline designed to accelerate ray tracing traversal algorithms using a combination of currently used programmable graphics processors and a new fixed hardware pipeline. Our fixed hardware pipeline performs an initial traversal operation that quickly identifies a smaller sized, fixed granularity spatial bounding box from the original scene. This spatial box can then be traversed further to identify subsequently smaller spatial bounding boxes using any user-defined acceleration algorithm. We show that our pipeline allows for an expected level of user programmability, including development of custom data structures, and can support a wide range of processor architectures. The performance of our pipeline is evaluated for ray traversal and intersection stages using a kd-tree ray tracing algorithm and a custom simulator modeling a generic streaming processor architecture. Experimental results show that our pipeline reduces the number of executed instructions on a graphics processor for the traversal operation by 2.15\u00d7 for visible rays. The memory bandwidth required for traversal is also reduced by a factor of 1.3\u00d7 for visible rays.","doi":"10.1109/SASP.2010.5521150","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 8th Symposium on Application Specific Processors (SASP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 8th Symposium on Application Specific Processors (SASP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507486/5521134/05521150.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SASP.2010.5521150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5521134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hardware pipeline for accelerating ray traversal algorithms on streaming processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5521150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5521150/","displayDocTitle":"A hardware pipeline for accelerating ray traversal algorithms on streaming processors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11445727","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5521150/","conferenceDate":"13-14 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hardware pipeline for accelerating ray traversal algorithms on streaming processors","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp05170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056152S","chronDate":"13-14 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507486","isNumber":"5521134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507486","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5521134","articleId":"5521150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5521152,"authors":[{"name":"Dominik Auras","affiliation":["RWTH Aachen University, Germany","Thales Research and Technology Limited, France"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Auras","id":"37392230200"},{"name":"Sylvain Girbal","affiliation":["Thales Research and Technology Limited, France"],"firstName":"Sylvain","lastName":"Girbal","id":"37393246000"},{"name":"Hugues Berry","affiliation":["INRIA Saclay \u00eele-de-France, France"],"firstName":"Hugues","lastName":"Berry","id":"37543537900"},{"name":"Olivier Temam","affiliation":["INRIA Saclay \u00eele-de-France, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Temam","id":"37282483400"},{"name":"Sami Yehia","affiliation":["Thales Research and Technology Limited, France"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Yehia","id":"37282483700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7954-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7953-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7952-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5521152","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":195},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMA: Chip multi-accelerator","abstract":"Custom acceleration has been a standard choice in embedded systems thanks to the power density and performance efficiency it provides. Parallelism is another orthogonal scalability path that efficiently overcomes the increasing limitation of frequency scaling in current general-purpose architectures. In this paper we propose a multi-accelerator architecture that combines the best of both worlds, parallelism and custom acceleration, while addressing the programmability inconvenience of heterogeneous multiprocessing systems. A Chip Multi-Accelerator (CMA) is a regular parallel architecture where each core is complemented with a custom accelerator to speed up specific functions. Furthermore, by using techniques to efficiently merge more than one custom accelerator together, we are able to cram as many accelerators as needed by the application or a domain of applications. We demonstrate our approach on a Software Defined Radio (SDR) case study. We show that starting from a baseline description of several SDR waveforms and candidate tasks for acceleration, we are able to map the different waveforms on the heterogeneous multi-accelerator architecture while keeping a logical view of a regular multi-core architecture, thus simplifying the mapping of the waveforms onto the multi-accelerator.","doi":"10.1109/SASP.2010.5521152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SASP.2010.5521152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5521134","startPage":"8","endPage":"15","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 8th Symposium on Application Specific Processors (SASP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507486/5521134/05521152.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 8th Symposium on Application Specific Processors (SASP)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5521152","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Computer architecture","Application software","Tiles","Parallel programming","Circuits","Scalability","Software radio","Concurrent computing","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMA","chip multiaccelerator architecture","embedded systems","power density","performance efficiency","orthogonal scalability path","frequency scaling","general-purpose architectures","regular parallel architecture","software defined radio","regular multicore architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"CMA: Chip multi-accelerator","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 June 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-14 June 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11445714","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5521152/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5521152/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMA: Chip multi-accelerator","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp03149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082642S","chronDate":"13-14 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507486","isNumber":"5521134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507486","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5521134","articleId":"5521152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5521153,"authors":[{"name":"Ruby B.

Furthermore, fast software implementations of AES that use table lookups are susceptible to software cache-based side channel attacks, leaking the secret encryption key. To bridge the gap between software and hardware AES implementations, several Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extensions have been proposed to provide speedup for software AES programs, most notably the recent introduction of six AES-specific instructions for Intel microprocessors. However, algorithm-specific instructions are less desirable than general-purpose ones for microprocessors. In this paper, we propose an enhanced parallel table lookup instruction that can achieve the fastest reported software AES encryption and decryption of 1.38 cycles/byte for general-purpose microprocessors, a 1.45X speedup from the fastest prior work reported. Also, security is improved where cache-based side-channel attacks are thwarted, since all table lookups take the same amount of time. Furthermore, the new instructions can also be used to accelerate any functions that can be accelerated through table lookup operations of one or multiple small tables.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 8th Symposium on Application Specific Processors (SASP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 8th Symposium on Application Specific Processors (SASP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507486/5521134/05521153.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"21","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Processor accelerator for AES","doi":"10.1109/SASP.2010.5521153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5521134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SASP.2010.5521153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5521153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5521153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Processor accelerator for AES","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11445715","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-14 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5521153/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Processor accelerator for AES","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp04154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038643S","chronDate":"13-14 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507486","isNumber":"5521134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507486","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5521134","articleId":"5521153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5521218,"authors":[{"name":"Huiqi Li","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"lastName":"Huiqi Li"},{"name":"Qingfeng Li","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"lastName":"Qingfeng Li"},{"name":"Junjie Zhang","affiliation":["Baoding Tianwei Group Company Limited, Baoding, China"],"lastName":"Junjie Zhang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-84919-140-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5521218","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5521218","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","magnetic flux","magnetic hysteresis","simulated annealing","soft magnetic materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Jiles-Atherton hysteresis model parameters","chaos optimization algorithm","simulated annealing algorithm","magnetic flux","time-domain finite-element calculations","magnetic vector potential formulation","soft magnetic materials"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chaos optimization algorithm","Simulated annealing algorithm","Jiles-Atherton model"]}],"doi":"10.1049/cp.2009.1370","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510065/5521209/05521218.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Microwave Technology and Computational Electromagnetics (ICMTCE 2009)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Microwave Technology and Computational Electromagnetics (ICMTCE 2009)","startPage":"471","endPage":"474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5521209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2009.1370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculation of Jiles-Atherton hysteresis model's parameters using mix of chaos optimization algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm","abstract":"A mix of chaos optimization method and simulated annealing method to calculate the Jiles-Atherton (JA) model's parameters is proposed in this paper.

By considering non-binary occurrences of web pages as internal utilities in web access sequences, e.g., time spent by each user in a web page, more realistic information can be extracted. However, the existing utility-based approach has many limitations such as considering only forward references of web access sequences, not applicable for incremental mining, suffers in the level-wise candidate generation-and-test methodology, needs several database scans and does not show how to mine web traversal sequences with external utility, i.e., different impacts/significances for different web pages. In this paper, we propose a new approach to solve these problems. Moreover, we propose two novel tree structures, called UWAS-tree (utility-based web access sequence tree), and IUWAS-tree (incremental UWAS tree), for mining web access sequences in static and dynamic databases respectively. Our approach can handle both forward and backward references, static and dynamic data, avoids the level-wise candidate generation-and-test methodology, does not scan databases several times and considers both internal and external utilities of a web page. Extensive performance analyses show that our approach is very efficient for both static and incremental mining of high utility web access sequences.","doi":"10.1109/SNPD.2010.21","publicationTitle":"2010 11th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 11th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521353/5521481/05521504.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNPD.2010.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5521481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mining High Utility Web Access Sequences in Dynamic Web Log Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5521504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5521504/","displayDocTitle":"Mining High Utility Web Access Sequences in Dynamic Web Log Data","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11446775","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5521504/","conferenceDate":"9-11 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mining High Utility Web Access Sequences in Dynamic Web Log Data","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"4088a076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050643S","chronDate":"9-11 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521353","isNumber":"5521481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521353","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5521481","articleId":"5521504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":5521520,"authors":[{"name":"Sathit Nakkrasae","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Ramkhamhaeng University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Sathit","lastName":"Nakkrasae","id":"37546558300"},{"name":"Pawalai Kraipeerapun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Ramkhamhaeng University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pawalai","lastName":"Kraipeerapun","id":"37267334900"},{"name":"Somkid Amornsamankul","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Thailand and Centre of Excellence in Mathematics CHE, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Somkid","lastName":"Amornsamankul","id":"37546587800"},{"name":"Chun Che Fung","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Murdoch University, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Chun Che","lastName":"Fung","id":"37396285700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7421-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7422-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5521520","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bagging","Neural networks","Natural languages","Buildings","Hybrid power systems","Ontologies","Software engineering","Artificial intelligence","Distributed computing","Bridges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","feedforward neural nets","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complementary neural networks","double dynamic weight averaging","ensemble technique","regression problems","bagging technique","feedforward backpropagation neural networks","UCI data set benchmarking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backpropagation Neural Network","Complementary Neural Networks","Diversity","Bagging","Ensemble"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5521520","abstract":"Ensemble technique has been widely applied in regression problems. This paper proposes a novel approach of the ensemble of Complementary Neural Network (CMTNN) using double dynamic weight averaging. In order to enhance the diversity in the ensemble, different training datasets created based on bagging technique are applied to an ensemble of pairs of feed-forward back-propagation neural networks created to predict the level of truth and falsity values. In order to obtain more accuracy, uncertainties in the prediction of truth and falsity values are used to weight the prediction results in two steps. In the first step, the weight is used to average the truth and the falsity values whereas the weight in the second step is used to calculate the final regression output. The proposed approach has been tested with benchmarking UCI data sets. The results derived from our technique improve the prediction performance while compared to the traditional ensemble of neural networks which is predicted based on only the truth values. Furthermore, the obtained results from our novel approach outperform the results from the existing ensemble of complementary neural network.","doi":"10.1109/SNPD.2010.34","startPage":"173","endPage":"178","publicationTitle":"2010 11th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNPD.2010.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5521481","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 11th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521353/5521481/05521520.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bagging of Complementary Neural Networks with Double Dynamic Weight Averaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5521520/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bagging of Complementary Neural Networks with Double Dynamic Weight Averaging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5521520/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11446791","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 June 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bagging of Complementary Neural Networks with Double Dynamic Weight Averaging","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"4088a173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045057S","chronDate":"9-11 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521353","isNumber":"5521481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521353","xplore-issue":"5521481","articleId":"5521520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5521521,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxin Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianxin","lastName":"Li","id":"37405686200"},{"name":"Bo Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Li","id":"38184313400"},{"name":"Zongxia Du","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zongxia","lastName":"Du","id":"37534452100"},{"name":"Linlin Meng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Linlin","lastName":"Meng","id":"37532443600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7421-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7422-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5521521","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":627},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5521521","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collaboration","Cloud computing","Distributed computing","Web and internet services","Application software","Security","Computer networks","Concurrent computing","Resource virtualization","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","protocols","security of data","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual organization","CloudVO","multiple cloud collaboration","cloud computing","Internet","multiple autonomous clouds","trust management technique","security policy","dynamic VO management protocols","intercloud collaboration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Virtual Organization","Trust Management","Access Control","Security Policy"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing has become a popular computing paradigm in which virtualized and scalable resources are consolidated to provide services over Internet. However, the resource capability of a single cloud is generally limited, and some applications often require various cloud centers over Internet to deliver services together. Therefore, a Virtual Organization (VO) will be a promising approach to integrate services and users across multiple autonomous clouds. However, how to build a secure virtual organization to achieve the collaboration goals is a critical problem, and some issues such as membership agreement, policy conflict and trust management should be adequately addressed. In this paper, we present a framework CloudVO which based on security policies and trust management techniques to provide some flexible and dynamic VO management protocols for clouds. Therefore, CloudVO can achieve inter-cloud collaboration without destroying a cloud's local policies. Based on previous VO security management experiences, we have conducted some preliminary simulations to verify the effectiveness our approaches for cloud computing environments.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5521481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNPD.2010.35","publicationTitle":"2010 11th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 11th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521353/5521481/05521521.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"186","doi":"10.1109/SNPD.2010.35","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CloudVO: Building a Secure Virtual Organization for Multiple Clouds Collaboration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"CloudVO: Building a Secure Virtual Organization for Multiple Clouds Collaboration","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5521521/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11446792","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5521521/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CloudVO: Building a Secure Virtual Organization for Multiple Clouds Collaboration","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"4088a181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051282S","chronDate":"9-11 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521353","isNumber":"5521481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521353","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5521481","articleId":"5521521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5521614,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaobing He","affiliation":["Information Security Research Center, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xiaobing","lastName":"He","id":"37539610600"},{"name":"Wu Yang","affiliation":["Information Security Research Center, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37535357500"},{"name":"Qing Wang","affiliation":["Information Security Research Center, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37536555300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6755-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6754-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4027-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5521614","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Telecommunication traffic","Monitoring","Internet","Computer networks","Information security","IP networks","Helium","Large-scale systems","High-speed networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP networks","probability","sampling methods","signal detection","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network anomaly detection","adaptive traffic sampling method","random packet sampling method","network monitoring","large IP flow","time stratification","data streaming","sampling probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network traffic","packet sampling","flow","strata","anomaly detecting"]}],"abstract":"The random packet sampling method is the simplest methodology for reducing the amount of packets that the network monitoring system has to process. However, the accuracy of anomaly detection is affected by the fact that this method biases a large IP flow. In order to reduce the impact of sampled traffic on network anomaly detecting, an adaptive traffic sampling method is proposed. This method is developed based on time stratification. Our adaptive method lies in an innovative scheme. It divides time into strata and then samples an incoming packet with a probability, which is a decreasing function f of the predicted size of the flow the packet belongs to. Instead of data streaming algorithms, we use packet samples and a sampling probability to estimate flow size, thus to save resources. A force sampling is also employed to increase the accuracy of estimation of smaller flows. Experiments results show that our scheme is more accurate than traditional random packet sampling for estimating anomalous traffic, thus the performance of anomalous detecting is improved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Traffic Sampling Method for Anomaly Detection","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Internet Computing for Science and Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICICSE.2009.32","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Internet Computing for Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521355/5521393/05521614.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICSE.2009.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5521393","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5521614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5521614/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Traffic Sampling Method for Anomaly Detection","conferenceDate":"21-22 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5521614/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11536761","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Traffic Sampling Method for Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4027a142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051415S","chronDate":"21-22 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5521355","isNumber":"5521393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521355","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5521393","articleId":"5521614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5521618,"authors":[{"name":"Changming Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, College of Medicine, University of Iowa, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Changming","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37534245900"},{"name":"Jun Ni","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, College of Medicine, University of Iowa, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Ni","id":"37401187500"},{"name":"Yanbo Li","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, College of Medicine, University of Iowa, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Yanbo","lastName":"Li","id":"37405716600"},{"name":"Guochang Gu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Guochang","lastName":"Gu","id":"37278628100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6755-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6754-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4027-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5521618","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":672},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5521618","abstract":"Speckle is a multiplicative noise that degrades the visual evaluation in ultrasound imaging.

In this paper we study alternatives to implement a particularly popular index, namely, the one able of finding all the positions in the collection of substrings of fixed length (q-grams). We introduce two novel techniques and show they constitute practical alternatives to handle this scenario.

In this article, we propose an approach, based upon Natural Language Processing techniques, that automatically extracts and organizes concepts from software identifiers in a WordNet-like structure that we call lexical views. These lexical views give useful insight on an overall software architecture and can be used to improve results of many software engineering tasks.

With the help of separation result of coding and spreading given by Veeravalli, we solve the coding-spreading tradeoff problem in the way of concatenating channel coding followed by spreading. In particular, we take two kinds of channel coding, i.e. feed-forward convolutional code and turbo code into consideration in this tradeoff problem. A low-complexity soft rake serial interference cancellation-aided turbo-type multiuser detection is utilized over AWGN channels. Theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations both reveal that under a preset bandwidth expansion, the tradeoff problem favours channel coding over repetition-code spreading in enhancing the system spectral efficiency.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2009.1999","publicationTitle":"IET International Communication Conference on Wireless Mobile and Computing (CCWMC 2009)","displayPublicationTitle":"IET International Communication Conference on Wireless Mobile and Computing (CCWMC 2009)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510786/5521890/05521965.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2009.1999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5521890","startPage":"496","endPage":"499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tradeoff of channel coding and repetition-code spreading in IDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5521965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"Tradeoff of channel coding and repetition-code spreading in IDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5521965/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tradeoff of channel coding and repetition-code spreading in IDMA systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"20091999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048627S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","isNumber":"5521890","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510786","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5521965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5522044,"authors":[{"name":"Li Shiyin","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Shiyin"},{"name":"Liu Mengyun","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Mengyun"},{"name":"Liu Qiong","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Qiong"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-84919-138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5522044","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","power control","game theory","utility function","dynamic price function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5522044","doi":"10.1049/cp.2009.1922","publicationTitle":"IET International Communication Conference on Wireless Mobile and Computing (CCWMC 2009)","abstract":"In cognitive radio system, power control is a key technique to copes with near-far effect, reduce multiple access interference and increase capacity of communication.

Propagation characterization is one of the main building blocks for such usages. The Gaussian beam has attractive features to become a prospective wave form for millimetre radio communication application. A ray tracing method embedded with spectral features of Gaussian beam is employed to analyze millimetre wave propagation in a circle tunnel in this paper. In consideration of geometrical figure of the tunnel, the superposition behaviour of direct and reflective beams is analyzed with simplified approximation of Gaussian beam spectral feature to derive receiving wave's amplitude, phase, and delay spread. A typical straight tunnel model is used to simulate the propagation behaviour, where strong multi-path effect with deeply fading of signal intensity and dramatically enhancing of delay spread emerges. Variations of receiving wave's power intensity and delay spread along with the beam travelling down in the tunnel, and spectral features of them at a designated point are also investigated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray tracing analysis of Gaussian beamed millimetre wave propagation in circle tunnel","publicationTitle":"IET International Communication Conference on Wireless Mobile and Computing (CCWMC 2009)","doi":"10.1049/cp.2009.1916","displayPublicationTitle":"IET International Communication Conference on Wireless Mobile and Computing (CCWMC 2009)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510786/5521890/05522050.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2009.1916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5521890","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5522050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Ray tracing analysis of Gaussian beamed millimetre wave propagation in circle tunnel","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray tracing analysis of Gaussian beamed millimetre wave propagation in circle tunnel","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"20091916.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059201S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","isNumber":"5521890","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510786","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5522050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5522139,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However, synchrophasors have a greater potential than monitoring and visualization. Synchrophasors will increasingly contribute to the reliable and economical operation of power systems as real-time control and protection schemes become broadly used. This paper describes several synchrophasor-based protection and control systems. One of these systems uses synchrophasor information for generator shedding. The other system uses synchrophasors for backup transmission line protection for ground faults. In addition, the paper describes a user-programmable, real-time synchrophasor processor and two of its applications: a distributed bus differential protection scheme and a system integrity protection system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time synchrophasor applications in power system control and protection","publicationTitle":"10th IET International Conference on Developments in Power System Protection (DPSP 2010).

Ultimately, the new SVM-based optimizing beamforming approach is proposed, which is used to optimize the corresponding parameters of array beamforming. The Support Vector Machine framework for uniform arrays beamforming is then established. Simulation results show that the SVM-based optimizing beamforming approach can not only approximate conventional one well in the case of free noise condition and small data sets, but also improve the generalization ability and reduce the computation burden. Also the sidelobe level of both linear and circular arrays by the SVM algorithm is improved sharply than the conventional one. The SVM-based beamforming is superior to the conventional one no matter linear and circular arrays, single and two non-coherent sources. The good performance shown on these different scenarios suggests that other beamforming optimization problems can be stated from this SVM framework. Compared with the conventional beamforming approaches, it provides a new and effective technique for the optimization design of beamformer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11471746","htmlLink":"/document/5522446/","conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Research on Support Vector Machines Framework for Uniform Arrays Beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on Support Vector Machines Framework for Uniform Arrays Beamforming","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"4077e124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074189S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521356","isNumber":"5522315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521356","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5522315","articleId":"5522446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5522464,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Zhang","affiliation":["University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/5638591/5522464/5522464-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Zhang received the B.S. degree in 2007, from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","He is a Visiting Ph.D. Student in the Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the most relevant research activities for minimizing energy consumption in telecom networks, with a specific emphasis on those employing optical technologies. We investigate the energy-minimization opportunities enabled by optical technologies and classify the existing approaches over different network domains, namely core, metro, and access networks. A section is also devoted to describe energy-efficient solutions for some of today's important applications using optical network technology, e.g., grid computing and data centers. We provide an overview of the ongoing standardization efforts in this area. This work presents a comprehensive and timely survey on a growing field of research, as it covers most aspects of energy consumption in optical telecom networks. We aim at providing a comprehensive reference for the growing base of researchers who will work on energy efficiency of telecom networks in the upcoming years.","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2011.062410.00034","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/5638591/05522464.pdf","startPage":"441","endPage":"458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2011.062410.00034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5638591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency in Telecom Optical Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5522464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522464/","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency in Telecom Optical Networks","volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2010","accessionNumber":"11641600","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5522464/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency in Telecom Optical Networks","sourcePdf":"02zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142717S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"5638591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"266","xplore-issue":"5638591","articleId":"5522464","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5522465,"authors":[{"name":"Sujesha Sudevalayam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6026692/5522465/5522465-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sujesha Sudevalayam received the B.E. degree in Computer Science from Mumbai University, India, in 2005.

Besides the widespread sensitivity to ecological issues, such interest also stems from economic needs, since both energy costs and electrical requirements of telcos' and Internet Service Providers' infrastructures around the world show a continuously growing trend. In this respect, a common opinion among networking researchers is that the sole introduction of low consumption silicon technologies may not be enough to effectively curb energy requirements. Thus, for disruptively boosting the network energy efficiency, these hardware enhancements must be integrated with ad-hoc mechanisms that explicitly manage energy saving, by exploiting network-specific features. This paper aims at providing a twofold contribution to green networking. At first, we explore current perspectives in power consumption for next generation networks. Secondly, we provide a detailed survey on emerging technologies, projects, and work-in-progress standards, which can be adopted in networks and related infrastructures in order to reduce their carbon footprint. The considered approaches range from energy saving techniques for networked hosts, to technologies and mechanisms for designing next-generation and energy-aware networks and networking equipment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency in the Future Internet: A Survey of Existing Approaches and Trends in Energy-Aware Fixed Network Infrastructures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2011.071410.00073","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/5764312/05522467.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2011.071410.00073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5764312","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5522467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522467/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Second Quarter  2011","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency in the Future Internet: A Survey of Existing Approaches and Trends in Energy-Aware Fixed Network Infrastructures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5522467/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2011","publicationDate":"Second Quarter 2011","accessionNumber":"11974188","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency in the Future Internet: A Survey of Existing Approaches and Trends in Energy-Aware Fixed Network Infrastructures","sourcePdf":"06bruschi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158164S","chronDate":"Second Quarter  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"5764312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"449","xplore-issue":"5764312","articleId":"5522467","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":5522468,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Zhang","affiliation":["School of ECS, University of Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Rong Zhang received the BEng degree in Communications Engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2003; and the MSc degree with Distinction in Radio Frequency Communications Engineering from University of Southampton, U.K., in 2005; and the PhD degree in Wireless Communications from University of Southampton, U.K., in 2009.

In conventional SR drives, the commutation induced energy exchange between the DC supply and the SR machine is the main cause of the DC-link voltage and current ripples and hence the need for a large capacitor. The commutation induced DC-link current fluctuation is significantly reduced by controlling the switching time and switching logic of the SR converter according to a specified average DC-link current over a defined switching period. The performance of the proposed new switching technique is investigated by comprehensive simulation studies on a 3-phase SR drive.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0180","publicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510043/5522470/05522488.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new switching technique for DC-link capacitor minimisation in switched reluctance machine drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"A new switching technique for DC-link capacitor minimisation in switched reluctance machine drives","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522488/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new switching technique for DC-link capacitor minimisation in switched reluctance machine drives","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"20100180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020368S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2010","isNumber":"5522470","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510043","citationCount":"8","articleId":"5522488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5522492,"authors":[{"name":"R.T.

The range of resonance frequencies is defined by the position-dependent phase inductance and a parasitic capacitance, mainly associated with the converter switches. In this paper, an analytical model is used to predict the aligned resonance frequency, taking into account material and geometry factors, as well as dynamic effects such as eddy current losses. The range of resonance frequencies can be influenced by mounting external capacitors over the power semiconductor devices. It is shown that an optimal aligned frequency is associated with a trade-off between a high position resolution and a high pulse-width modulation frequency. Good correspondence is obtained between the model-predicted results and measurements on a switched reluctance drive.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522504/","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Influence of converter capacitance in resonance-based sensorless switched reluctance drives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of converter capacitance in resonance-based sensorless switched reluctance drives","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"20100109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025056S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2010","isNumber":"5522470","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510043","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5522504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5522508,"authors":[{"name":"G.

At high frequency d-q incremental inductances become dominant over the d-q normal (chord) inductances. In addition when load is applied to the machine cross-coupling inductance arise since the saliency/anisotropy angle, which is synchronised with the rotor position at no and light load applications, is delayed from the actual rotor position. To estimate accurately the rotor position, cross-coupling and self incremental inductances have to be known at various operating points. In this paper online inductances determination technique based on the Goertzel algorithm is proposed to compensate for the position error. Analytical interpretation and simulation results are shown to validate the proposed technique.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0111","publicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510043/5522470/05522508.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online cross-coupling and self incremental inductances determination of salient Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5522508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Online cross-coupling and self incremental inductances determination of salient Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522508/","publicationDate":"April 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online cross-coupling and self incremental inductances determination of salient Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"20100111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045555S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2010","isNumber":"5522470","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510043","citationCount":"9","articleId":"5522508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5522510,"authors":[{"name":"A.

IGBT power modules are constructed of layers and power dies, all of which are interconnected with solder or bond wires. These materials have dissimilar coefficients of thermal expansion and during its life, the IGBT module experiences temperature changes which cause stresses to build up in the various materials eventually resulting in the failure of the module. Because of the high robustness of these modules, testing in service for time to failure can be a very lengthy process.

This paper proposes a pre-charge scheme which yields a smooth and controllable connection of the input filter to the utility grid along with total absence of overvoltage across the input filter capacitors.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0126","publicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510043/5522470/05522523.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Input filter pre-charge scheme for high power PWM-CSRs connected to a weak utility supply","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Input filter pre-charge scheme for high power PWM-CSRs connected to a weak utility supply","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522523/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Input filter pre-charge scheme for high power PWM-CSRs connected to a weak utility supply","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"20100126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021097S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2010","isNumber":"5522470","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510043","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5522523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5522524,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Yang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Wuhua Li","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wuhua","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Yan Deng","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Deng"},{"name":"Xiangning He","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiangning","lastName":"He"},{"name":"Simon Lambert","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic & Computer Engineering, University of Newcastle, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Lambert"},{"name":"Volker Pickert","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic & Computer Engineering, University of Newcastle, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Pickert"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-84919-231-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5522524","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":961},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["photovoltaic (PV) system","transformerless","common-mode voltage","common-mode current"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5522524","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510043/5522470/05522524.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0129","doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522470","publicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel single-phase transformerless photovoltaic inveter connected to grid","abstract":"A novel inverter topology for transformerless PV systems is proposed in this paper to meet the requirements of high efficiency, small size, light weight and low cost.

Furthermore, not only the unipolar PWM but also the double frequency PWM can be both applied in the proposed inverter, and a lower ripple and a higher frequency of the filter inductor current can be achieved. Therefore, a smaller filter inductor can be employed and the copper losses and core losses are reduced greatly, or the higher quality and lower THD of the grid-connected current are achieved.

Matrix Converters (MCs) are a good alternative to back-to-back converters because they have several advantages in term of size and weight. Therefore MCs can be advantageously used in any variable speed generation system where high efficiency, reliability, small size and low weight are considered important factors. Possible applications are mobile power supply systems, variable speed diesel generation schemes and wind energy conversion systems. Nevertheless, to interface a MC-based generation system to unbalanced 3\u03a6 stand-alone loads, a four-leg MC is required to provide a path for the zero sequence load current. However, the conventional Space Vector Modulation (SVM) algorithm used with 3\u00d73 MCs cannot be applied to a four-leg matrix converter. Therefore, in this paper a SVM algorithm, adequate for the operation of a 3\u00d74 MC is presented. The proposed modulation scheme is mathematically analysed and experimental results, obtained with an experimental prototype, are discussed.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0146","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510043/5522470/05522541.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental validation of a Space Vector Modulation method for a 4-leg Matrix Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522541/","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Experimental validation of a Space Vector Modulation method for a 4-leg Matrix Converter","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental validation of a Space Vector Modulation method for a 4-leg Matrix Converter","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"20100146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062414S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2010","isNumber":"5522470","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510043","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5522541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5522545,"authors":[{"name":"T.J.

Direct torque control (DTC) for permanent magnet synchronous motors can provide this accurate and fast torque control. When applying DTC the change of the stator flux linkage vector is controlled. As such the estimation of the stator flux linkage is essential. In this paper the performance of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for stator flux linkage estimation is studied. Starting from a formulation of the EKF for isotropic motors, the influence of rotor anisotropy and saturation is evaluated. Subsequently it is expanded to highly isotropic motors as well. In both cases the possibilities to add parameter estimations are evaluated.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0150","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510043/5522470/05522545.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the stator flux linkage estimation of an PMSM with extended kalman filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522545/","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"On the stator flux linkage estimation of an PMSM with extended kalman filters","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the stator flux linkage estimation of an PMSM with extended kalman filters","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"20100150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034678S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2010","isNumber":"5522470","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510043","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5522545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5522547,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The first scheme consists of a PD feedback and a dynamic compensator which is composed of RBF neural network and variable structure. The adaptive laws of Network weights are based on Lyapunov function method. This controller can guarantee stability of closed-loop system and asymptotic convergence of tracking errors. The second scheme substitutes the integrated controller consisting of neural network and variable structure for the hybrid controller by way of smooth function. This integrated controller can reduce chattering of variable structure control input, overcome the deficiencies of local generalization neural networks and improve control precision and convergence speed. In addition, This controller is still able to ensure the system maintains good robustness and stability in the case of neural network disabled. The simulation results have showed the effectiveness of two kinds of control schemes, and that the second scheme is more advantageous.","doi":"10.1109/ICICTA.2010.95","startPage":"884","endPage":"888","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Computation Technology and

It is a key step in the IC applications regarding cryptography, security, and digital rights management. However, GLC is challenging due to the existence of manufacturing variability (MV) and the strong correlations among some gates in the circuit. We propose a new solution for GLC by using thermal conditioning techniques. In particular, we apply thermal control on the process of GLC, which breaks the correlations by imposing extra variations concerning gate level leakage power. The scaling factors of all the gates can be characterized by solving a system of linear equations using linear programming (LP). Based on the obtained gate level scaling factors, we demonstrate an application of GLC, hardware Trojan horse (HTH) detection, by using constraint manipulation. We evaluate our approach of GLC and HTH detection on several ISCAS85/89 benchmarks. The simulation results show that our thermally conditioned GLC approach is capable of characterizing all the gates with an average error less than the measurement error, and we can detect HTHs with 100% accuracy on a target circuit.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gate-level characterization: Foundations and hardware security applications","publicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510861/5522347/05522644.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522347","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5522644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Gate-level characterization: Foundations and hardware security applications","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5522644/","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11453494","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gate-level characterization: Foundations and hardware security applications","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064163S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510861","isNumber":"5522347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510861","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5522347","articleId":"5522644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5522660,"authors":[{"name":"Li Mingjuan","affiliation":["College of Economics & Management, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Mingjuan","id":"37543097400"},{"name":"Tan Guoshuang","affiliation":["College of Economics & Management, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Tan","lastName":"Guoshuang","id":"37543098600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7280-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7279-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5522660","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Neural networks","Data mining","Mining industry","Artificial neural networks","Forestry","Financial management","Computer industry","Industrial economics","Economic forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","financial management","forestry","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["viability prediction model","neural network","data mining technique","forest industry enterprise","formal financial statement","viability ratios","factor analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Network","Data Mining","Viability","Prediction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5522660","abstract":"The operating status of a forest industry enterprise is disclosed periodically for viability.

The projected increase in the number of cores in future CMPs is putting stringent demands on the design of the on-chip network (or network-on-chip, NOC). Nanophotonic interconnects have recently emerged as a viable alternate technology solution for the design of NOC because of their higher communication bandwidth, much reduced power consumption and wiring simplification. Several photonic NOC approaches have recently been proposed. A common feature of almost all of these approaches is the integration of the entire optical network onto a single silicon waveguide layer. However, keeping the entire network on a single layer has a serious implication for power losses and design complexity due to the large amount of waveguide crossings. In this paper, we propose MPNOC: a multilayer photonic networks-on-chip. MPNOC combines the recent advances in silicon photonics and three-dimensional (3D) stacking technology with architectural innovations in an integrated architecture that provides ample bandwidth, low latency, and energy efficient on-chip communications for future CMPs. Simulation results show MPNOC can achieve 81.92 TFLOP/s peak bandwidth and an energy savings up to 23% compared to other proposed planar photonic NOC architectures.","doi":"10.1145/1837274.1837314","publicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510861/5522347/05522707.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1837274.1837314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522347","startPage":"156","endPage":"161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multilayer nanophotonic interconnection network for on-chip many-core communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5522707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A multilayer nanophotonic interconnection network for on-chip many-core communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522707/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11453509","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5522707/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multilayer nanophotonic interconnection network for on-chip many-core communications","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087432S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510861","isNumber":"5522347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510861","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5522347","articleId":"5522707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5522709,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhanhui","affiliation":["Changchun Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhanhui","id":"37542070600"},{"name":"Li Liqiang","affiliation":["Changchun Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Liqiang","id":"37542072200"},{"name":"Li Xiaodong","affiliation":["Changchun Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Xiaodong","id":"37530945200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7280-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7279-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5522709","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"abstract":"Semi-active fuzzy neural network control is presented in terms of nonlinear characteristic of MRF(magneto-rheological fluid) damper, simulating results show that semi-active control using fuzzy neural network can effectively reduce MRF damper's vibration displacement and acceleration response.

Meanwhile, a comprehensive learning is introduced to strengthen the diversity of population and prevents the stagnation. On this basis, a disturbance mechanism is added, which is furthermore to avoid plunging into local optimum. The new algorithm is tested by four typical functions. Results of simulation experiments show that new algorithm conquers the stagnation effectively, improves the global convergence ability and has better optimization performance than traditional Quantum Genetic Algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11472096","htmlLink":"/document/5522733/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Cooperative Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Function Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Cooperative Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Function Optimization","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"4077a531.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062998S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521356","isNumber":"5522426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521356","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5522426","articleId":"5522733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5522741,"authors":[{"name":"Song Yongxian","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronic Engineering, Huaihai Institute of Technology, Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Yongxian","id":"37395616700"},{"name":"Zhang Hanxia","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronic Engineering, Huaihai Institute of Technology, Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Hanxia","id":"37543044700"},{"name":"Gong Chenglong","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronic Engineering, Huaihai Institute of Technology, Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Gong","lastName":"Chenglong","id":"37398544900"},{"name":"He Naibao","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronic Engineering, Huaihai Institute of Technology, Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Naibao","id":"37543044500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7280-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7279-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5522741","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Neural networks","Predictive models","Predictive control","Control nonlinearities","Multi-layer neural network","Prediction algorithms","Nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control nonlinearities","feedforward neural nets","nonlinear control systems","optimisation","predictive control","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear system control","multilayer forward neural network","inverse controller","predictive optimization algorithm","uncertain plant nonlinearities","reverse control","multi-step predictive index function","dynamic speed"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural network","Multi-step prediction","Non-linear system","Inverse dynamic control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5522741","abstract":"A multi-layer forward neural network acted as the inverse controller, which was trained with predictive optimization algorithm to compensate for disturbances and uncertain plant nonlinearities, and reverse control based on neural network is implemented in complicated non-linear system.

In this work we will present an error analysis technique that is able to efficiently calculate the number of critical bits needed to implement each LUT. We will perform this analysis using a scalable overlapping window-based method called DCOW (Don't-care Computation with Overlapping Windows), which allows for accurate and efficient don't-care lower bound calculations. This new windowing technique can approximate the complete don't cares within 2.34%, and can be used for many logic synthesis operations. In particular, we apply DCOW to our FPGA mapping algorithm to reduce the number of possible faults. This will allow the design to have a much higher success of functioning correctly when implemented on a faulty FPGA. By using our algorithm, we are able to reduce the number of possible faults by more than 12% with no area increase.","displayPublicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510861/5522347/05522779.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"522","publicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","doi":"10.1145/1837274.1837401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1837274.1837401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522347","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5522779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LUT-based FPGA technology mapping for reliability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Circuit faults","Table lookup","Electrical fault detection","Fault detection","Nanoscale devices","Error analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Clocks","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit reliability","error analysis","fault diagnosis","field programmable gate arrays","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LUT-based FPGA technology mapping","manufacturing defects","multiple defects","lookup table","error analysis technique","dont-care computation with overlapping windows","logic synthesis","DCOW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error Analysis","Windowing","Don't Cares","Logic Synthesis","Technology Mapping","FPGA Lookup Table"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"LUT-based FPGA technology mapping for reliability","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5522779/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11453516","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LUT-based FPGA technology mapping for reliability","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102246S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510861","isNumber":"5522347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510861","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5522347","articleId":"5522779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5522793,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Bo","affiliation":["Resources & Equipment Bureau, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Bo","id":"37531484700"},{"name":"Wang Xueyuan","affiliation":["Economy & Management College, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Xueyuan","id":"37543037200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7280-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7279-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5522793","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":371},"abstract":"Security is one of important research issues in wireless sensor networks (WSN) applications.

This is widely considered to be a very challenging problem due to the difficulty of parallel programming and the bottlenecks to efficient parallel execution. Inspired by how networking and storage systems have scaled to handle very large volumes of packet traffic and persistent data, we propose a new approach to the design of scalable, parallel computing platforms. For decades, computing platforms have gone to great lengths to ensure that every computation specified by applications is faithfully executed. While this design philosophy has remained largely unchanged, applications and the basic characteristics of their workloads have changed considerably. A wide range of existing and emerging computing workloads have an inherent forgiving nature. We therefore argue that adopting a best-effort service model for various software and hardware components of the computing platform stack can lead to drastic improvements in scalability. Applications are cognizant of the best-effort model, and separate their computations into those that may be executed on a best-effort basis and those that require the traditional execution guarantees. Best-effort computations may be exploited to simply reduce the computing workload, shape it to be more suitable for parallel execution, or execute it on unreliable hardware components. Guaranteed computations are realized either through an overlay software layer on top of the best-effort substrate, or through the use of application-specific strategies. We describe a system architecture for a best-effort computing platform, provide examples of parallel software and hardware that embody the best-effort model, and show that large improvements in performance and energy efficiency are possible through the adoption of this approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522827/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5522827/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11453518","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Best-effort computing: Re-thinking parallel software and hardware","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Best-effort computing: Re-thinking parallel software and hardware","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061503S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510861","isNumber":"5522347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510861","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5522347","articleId":"5522827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5522837,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbin Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Zhongshan, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Wenbin","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37538441400"},{"name":"Xunlin Zhu","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Zhengzhou University of Light Industry, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Xunlin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37536985400"},{"name":"Yiqun Deng","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Information and Engineering University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Yiqun","lastName":"Deng","id":"37538736300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7280-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7279-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5522837","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Neural networks","Asymptotic stability","Stability criteria","Delay effects","Upper bound","Linear matrix inequalities","Neurons","Intelligent networks","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delays","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","neural nets","time-varying systems","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay composition approach","stability analysis","neural network","time varying delay","asymptotical stability","activation function","Lyapunov functional","defining decomposition method","convex combination technique","conservative stability criterion","linear matrix inequality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotical stability","neural networks (NNs)","time-varying delays","convex ombination","linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5522837","abstract":"This paper studies the asymptotical stability for a class of neural networks (NNs) with time-varying delay.

This work first proposes a compact on-chip sensor design that tracks both NBTI and PBTI for both logic and SRAM circuits. Embedded in an SRAM array the sensor takes the form of a 6T SRAM cell and is at least 30\u00d7 smaller than previous designs. Extensively reusing the SRAM peripheral circuitry minimizes control logic overhead. Sensing overhead is further amortized as the sensors can be both reconfigured and recycled as functional SRAM cells, potentially increasing SRAM yield when other bit cells fail due to initial process variation or long time aging effects. The paper also proposes a variation-aware sensor system design methodology by quantifying and leveraging the tradeoff between the size and number of sensors and the system sensing precision. Design examples show that a system of 500 sensors can achieve 4mV precision with 98.8% confidence, and a system of 1K sensors designed for 1M SRAM bit cells achieves 2000\u00d7 area overhead reduction compared to a worst-case based approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SRAM-based NBTI/PBTI sensor system design","publicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510861/5522347/05522917.pdf","startPage":"849","endPage":"852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522347","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5522917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"SRAM-based NBTI/PBTI sensor system design","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5522917/","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11453522","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAM-based NBTI/PBTI sensor system design","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.338435S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510861","isNumber":"5522347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510861","xplore-issue":"5522347","articleId":"5522917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5522972,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Xin","affiliation":["IIT,  Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Xin","id":"37398839300"},{"name":"Zhan Shaobin","affiliation":["IIT,  Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhan","lastName":"Shaobin","id":"37394684300"},{"name":"Xu Jiong","affiliation":["IIT,  Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Jiong","id":"37543030800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7280-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7279-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5522972","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":394},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5522972","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Decoding","Wireless LAN","Parity check codes","Performance loss","Automation","Information analysis","Information technology","Baseband","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","cyclic codes","error correction codes","forward error correction","matrix algebra","parity check codes","WiMax","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QC-LDPC decoding algorithms","WLAN systems","next generation wireless systems","IEEE802.11n","IEEE 802.16e","error-correction capacity","high-data rate transmission","low density parity check code","FEC code","quasicyclic LDPC code","QC-LDPC code","parity-check matrix","quasi-cyclic character","log-BP algorithm","AWGN channel","min-sum algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QC-LDPC","IEEE802.16e","Wireless LAN"]}],"abstract":"Next generation wireless systems, such as IEEE802.11n and 802.16e, need high error-correction capacity to achieve high data rate transmission.

Simulations results under a next generation wireless LAN system show that MS comparing with the Log-BP performance has approximately 0.5dB loss for high-speed rates codes over AWGN channel, however the performance of normalized MS and row weight matched MS with relatively low complexity is nearly the same as that of Log-BP algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICICTA.2010.820","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Computation Technology and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Computation Technology and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521356/5522426/05522972.pdf","startPage":"694","endPage":"697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICTA.2010.820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis on QC-LDPC Decoding Algorithms for WLAN Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5522972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Analysis on QC-LDPC Decoding Algorithms for WLAN Systems","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5522972/","accessionNumber":"11472163","volume":"1","publicationDate":"May 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis on QC-LDPC Decoding Algorithms for WLAN Systems","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"4077a694.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036846S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521356","isNumber":"5522426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521356","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5522426","articleId":"5522972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5522986,"authors":[{"name":"Weiwei Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Weiwei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37538052800"},{"name":"Haixin Sun","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Haixin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37403470500"},{"name":"Weijie Shen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Weijie","lastName":"Shen","id":"37403532000"},{"name":"Yonghuai Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Yonghuai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405819900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7280-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7279-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5522986","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Transmitting antennas","Fading","Wireless communication","Decoding","Mobile antennas","Wireless networks","Antenna arrays","Receiving antennas","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","OFDM modulation","radio networks","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative diversity","OFDM system","orthogonal used frequency division multiplexing","wireless network","DF cooperative scheme","decode-and-forward","amplify-and-forward","AF cooperative","DF cooperative","multiple antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative Diversity","OFDM","Amplify-and-Forward","Decode-and-Forward"]}],"abstract":"In recent years cooperative diversity has been widely used in wireless network, and Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a key technique of multi-carrier transmission to meet high data rate requirement of wireless communication.

Due to sheer design complexity, it is nearly impossible to detect and fix all bugs before manufacture. Post-silicon validation is a major challenge for future systems. Today, it is largely viewed as an art with very few systematic solutions. As a result, post-silicon validation is an emerging research topic with several exciting opportunities for major innovations in electronic design automation. In this paper, we provide an overview of the post-silicon validation problem and how it differs from traditional pre-silicon verification and manufacturing testing.

In this paper we discuss how this challenge can be addressed algorithmically.","publicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510861/5522347/05523136.pdf","startPage":"457","endPage":"462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1837274.1837389","doi":"10.1145/1837274.1837389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded memory binding in FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Embedded memory binding in FPGAs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523136/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5523136/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11453536","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded memory binding in FPGAs","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066817S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510861","isNumber":"5522347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510861","xplore-issue":"5522347","articleId":"5523136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5523154,"authors":[{"name":"Michael A.

Reliability analysis and the simulation of self-test structures are particularly computationally expensive as a large number of patterns has to be evaluated. In this work, we propose to map a fault simulation algorithm based on the parallel-pattern single-fault propagation (PPSFP) paradigm to many-core architectures and describe the involved algorithmic optimizations. Many-core architectures are characterized by a high number of simple execution units with small local memory. The proposed fault simulation algorithm exploits the parallelism of these architectures by use of parallel data structures. The algorithm is implemented for the NVIDIA GT200 Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) architecture and achieves a speed-up of up to 17x compared to an existing GPU fault-simulation algorithm and up to 16x compared to state-of-the-art algorithms on conventional processor architectures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523154/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11453540","htmlLink":"/document/5523154/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Efficient fault simulation on many-core processors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient fault simulation on many-core processors","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082303S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510861","isNumber":"5522347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510861","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5522347","articleId":"5523154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5523177,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Ma","affiliation":["School of Management and Economic, North China University of Water Conservancy and Electric Power, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Ma","id":"37537756200"},{"name":"Yong Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37089073961"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7280-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7279-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5523177","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":420},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electricity supply industry","Particle swarm optimization","Power generation economics","Power system dynamics","Power system economics","Load modeling","Spinning","Quadratic programming","Power system simulation","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load dispatching","particle swarm optimisation","power markets","power system economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved particle swarm optimization algorithm","electricity market","dynamic load economic dispatch"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dynamic load economic dispatch","spinning reserve","particles swarm optimization algorithm","period optimization strategy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523177","abstract":"An improved strategy particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the dynamic load economic dispatch problems in power systems.

But the forecasting errors of the load curve near peaks are large, especially at the large slope difference on both side of a peak. So the load forecasting based on rough set and neural network is proposed. The load in the current time interval, load in the previous time interval, load deviation between the current time interval and the previous time interval and current time is regarded as an input of a neural network respectively. The forecasting load at following time interval is the output of the neural network. The trained neural network is the load forecasting model based on neural network. Then, the forecasting load at following time interval obtained by the neural network based load forecasting model is compensated by rough set to increase the forecasting accuracy. The simulation experiments show that the presented load forecasting based on rough set and neural network can improve the forecasting accuracy significantly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523190/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11471891","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5523190/","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Very Short-Term Load Forecasting Based on Neural Network and Rough Set","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Very Short-Term Load Forecasting Based on Neural Network and Rough Set","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"4077f132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049723S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521356","isNumber":"5522315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521356","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5522315","articleId":"5523190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5523223,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanzhe Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yuanzhe","lastName":"Wang","id":"37540178300"},{"name":"Chi-Un Lei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chi-Un","lastName":"Lei","id":"37286772700"},{"name":"Grantham K.

Subsequently, we synthesize them into complex patterns by merging events in time and chaining the patterns using inference rules. We specifically designed our algorithm to make it highly efficient and meaningful for digital circuits. In addition, we propose a pattern-mining diagnosis framework where specifications mined from correct and erroneous traces are used to automatically localize an error. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on industrial-size examples by mining specifications from traces of over a million cycles in a few minutes and use them to successfully localize errors of different types to within module boundaries.","startPage":"755","endPage":"760","displayPublicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510861/5522347/05523247.pdf","publicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable specification mining for verification and diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Scalable specification mining for verification and diagnosis","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5523247/","accessionNumber":"11453560","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523247/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable specification mining for verification and diagnosis","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070309S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510861","isNumber":"5522347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510861","xplore-issue":"5522347","articleId":"5523247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5523251,"authors":[{"name":"Byong Chan Lim","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Byong Chan","lastName":"Lim","id":"37534255500"},{"name":"Jaeha Kim","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaeha","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293481500"},{"name":"Mark A.

Interestingly, the abstract behavior of most analog circuits is a linear system, but sometimes only when viewed through a transformation of variables. When linearity holds, validation for the consistency between a circuit and a model can be efficiently performed with a small set of test vectors that grows linearly with the number of analog inputs. The linear abstraction for analog circuits also helps us distinguish different types of analog and digital I/O ports and verify their consistency effectively. We demonstrate the implemented tool by comparing a simple serial link receiver against its functional model.","publicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510861/5522347/05523251.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522347","startPage":"767","endPage":"772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient test vector generation for checking analog/mixed-signal functional models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient test vector generation for checking analog/mixed-signal functional models","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523251/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11453562","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5523251/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient test vector generation for checking analog/mixed-signal functional models","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"453.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078091S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510861","isNumber":"5522347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510861","xplore-issue":"5522347","articleId":"5523251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5523280,"authors":[{"name":"Ragunathan Rajkumar","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Ragunathan","lastName":"Rajkumar","id":"37268048500"},{"name":"Insup Lee","affiliation":["University of Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Insup","lastName":"Lee","id":"37279665300"},{"name":"Lui Sha","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Lui","lastName":"Sha","id":"37279656500"},{"name":"John Stankovic","affiliation":["University of Virginia Charlottesville, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Stankovic","id":"37279446200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0002-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6677-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0002-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"5523280","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":377,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8902},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Systems engineering and theory","Monitoring","Communication system control","Control systems","Physics computing","Internet","Humans","Power generation economics","Transportation","Manufacturing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","power engineering computing","power grids","social aspects of automation","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyber physical system","next computing revolution","Internet","human interaction","healthcare","cross-disciplinary community"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cyber-physical systems","engineering","computer science","grand challenges","new frontiers"]}],"abstract":"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are physical and engineered systems whose operations are monitored, coordinated, controlled and integrated by a computing and communication core.

It guarantees the same computational complexity as the fastest sequential version and can achieve up to 10 times speedup.","publicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510861/5522347/05523308.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"An effective GPU implementation of breadth-first search","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5523308/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11453569","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523308/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective GPU implementation of breadth-first search","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070929S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510861","isNumber":"5522347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510861","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5522347","articleId":"5523308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5523314,"authors":[{"name":"Yihu Wu","affiliation":["Changsha University of Science and Technology, School of Automobile and Mechanical Engineering, changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yihu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37407307400"},{"name":"Biao Kuang","affiliation":["Changsha University of Science and Technology, School of Automobile and Mechanical Engineering, changsha, China"],"firstName":"Biao","lastName":"Kuang","id":"37394312700"},{"name":"Hangyang Li","affiliation":["Changsha University of Science and Technology, School of Automobile and Mechanical Engineering, changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hangyang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085980953"},{"name":"Huanchun Gong","affiliation":["Changsha University of Science and Technology, School of Automobile and Mechanical Engineering, changsha, China"],"firstName":"Huanchun","lastName":"Gong","id":"37397346800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7280-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7279-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5523314","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Rough sets","Neural networks","Internal combustion engines","Fires","Mathematical model","Electric breakdown","Testing","Pollution","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon compounds","fault diagnosis","internal combustion engines","mechanical engineering computing","radial basis function networks","rough set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["I.C. engine misfire fault diagnosis method","rough sets theory","internal combustion engine","CA6100 engine","RBF neural network","MATLAB software","test data","CO2"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["internal combustion engine","misfire","rough sets","fault diagnosis","information fusion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523314","abstract":"A method for diagnosis of misfire fault in internal combustion engine based on exhaust density of HC, CO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n, O\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n and the engine's work parameters are presented in this paper.

The engine's work parameters, exhaust emission with misfire fault and without fault are tested by the experimentation of CA6100 engine. A diagnosis model which describing the relationship between the misfire degree and the internal combustion engine's exhaust emission and work parameters is established based on rough sets theory and RBF neural network. The model reduces the sample size, optimizes the neural network, increase the diagnosis correctness. The model is also trained by test data and MATLAB software. The model has been used to diagnosis internal combustion engine misfire fault, the result illustrates that this diagnosis model is suitable.

In 3D ICs, it is essential to stack only good dies by testing the individual dies before stacking. For the clock signaling, the pre-bond testing requires a complete 2D clock tree on each die. The previous work enables the pre-bond testability by allocating specially designed resources called TSV-buffers and redundant trees with transmission gates. We proposes viable solutions to the two fundamental problems of the previous work: (1) using much less buffer resources by preventing (potentially `bad') TSV-buffers with a new tree topology generation algorithm; (2) completely removing the transmission gate control lines by using a specially designed component called self controlled clock transmission gate (SCCTG). Compared to the existing 3D tree topology generation algorithms, solution 1 can use 56%-88% less number of TSVs, 53%-67% less number of buffers, 22%-65% less total wirelength, and 26%-43% less clock power for the benchmark circuits with dense sink placements. Moreover, solution 2 reduces the total wirelength of all the benchmark circuits by 17% and 23% on average for the 2-die and 4-die stacked 3D ICs, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11453573","htmlLink":"/document/5523329/","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Clock tree synthesis with pre-bond testability for 3D stacked IC Designs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clock tree synthesis with pre-bond testability for 3D stacked IC Designs","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102069S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510861","isNumber":"5522347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510861","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5522347","articleId":"5523329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5523336,"authors":[{"name":"Yinghui Huang","affiliation":["Information Science and Technology College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Yinghui","lastName":"Huang","id":"37536894900"},{"name":"Guanyu Li","affiliation":["Information Science and Technology College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Guanyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37405542600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7280-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7279-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5523336","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":4173},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523336","abstract":"This paper focuses on the concept itself of Internet of Things, which are related to the literal meaning, the internal property and the external relation.

However, for deep-submicron process technologies, significant variation in MRAM cells' operating regions results in write failures in cells and reduces the production yield. Currently, memory designers characterize failed MRAM chips to find a suitable current level for reconfiguring their operating current, which is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an efficient operating current search method and a built-in circuit for toggle MRAM, which can rapidly find a customized operating current for each MRAM chip. With the built-in circuit, an MRAM chip can dynamically reconfigure its operating current automatically. Production yield and product life-time thus can be increased.","publicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510861/5522347/05523434.pdf","startPage":"923","endPage":"928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast identification of operating current for toggle MRAM by spiral search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fast identification of operating current for toggle MRAM by spiral search","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11453593","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5523434/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast identification of operating current for toggle MRAM by spiral search","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"532.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069576S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510861","isNumber":"5522347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510861","xplore-issue":"5522347","articleId":"5523434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5523451,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiu-Ming Chang","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hsiu-Ming","lastName":"Chang","id":"37539356000"},{"name":"Jiun-Lang Huang","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jiun-Lang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37281261300"},{"name":"Ding-Ming Kwai","affiliation":["Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ding-Ming","lastName":"Kwai","id":"37294410600"},{"name":"Kwang-Ting Cheng","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kwang-Ting","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38183117700"},{"name":"Cheng-Wen Wu","affiliation":["Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan","National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Wen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37276423200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0002-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6677-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0002-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"5523451","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"abstract":"A three-dimensional (3D) CMOS imager constructed by stacking a pixel array of backside illuminated sensors, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) array, and an image signal processor (ISP) array using micro-bumps (ubumps) and through-silicon vias (TSVs) is promising for high throughput applications. However, due to the direct mapping from pixels to ISPs, the overall yield relies heavily on the correctness of the ubumps, ADCs and TSVs - a single defect leads to the information loss of a tile of pixels. This paper presents an error tolerance scheme for the 3D CMOS imager that can still deliver high quality images in the presence of \u03bcbump, ADC, and/or TSV failures. The error tolerance is achieved by properly interleaving the connections from pixels to ADCs so that the corrupted data, if any, can be recovered in the ISPs. A key design parameter, the interleaving stride, is decided by analyzing the employed error correction algorithm. Architectural simulation results demonstrate that the error tolerance scheme enhances the effective yield of an exemplar 3D imager from 46% to 99%.","displayPublicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510861/5522347/05523451.pdf","startPage":"917","endPage":"922","publicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522347","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An error tolerance scheme for 3D CMOS imagers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor arrays","CMOS image sensors","Through-silicon vias","Interleaved codes","Algorithm design and analysis","CMOS process","Stacking","Pixel","Analog-digital conversion","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","interleaved codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error tolerance scheme","3D CMOS imagers","pixel array","backside illuminated sensors","analog-to-digital converter array","image signal processor array","through-silicon vias"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D IC","error tolerance","image sensor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"An error tolerance scheme for 3D CMOS imagers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5523451/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11453598","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An error tolerance scheme for 3D CMOS imagers","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"531.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053014S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510861","isNumber":"5522347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510861","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5522347","articleId":"5523451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5523454,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538283400"},{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Li","id":"37276871700"},{"name":"Garng M.

Recently proposed dynamic noise margins precisely characterize dynamic stability using the concept of stability boundaries, or separatrices, and provide elegant separatrix tracing algorithm. However, the present separatrix characterization method is only efficient in the two-dimensional state space and hence not practically applicable to fully extracted SRAM designs with additional parasitics. We present a rigorous system-theoretical approach for computing the tangent approximation to the separatrix in the high-dimensional space. Using this as a basis, we develop fast method based on tangent approximation and exact iterative-refinement method for analyzing SRAM dynamic stability.

We propose scalable effort hardware design as an approach to tap the reservoir of algorithmic resilience and translate it into highly efficient hardware implementations. The basic tenet of the scalable effort design approach is to identify mechanisms at each level of design abstraction (circuit, architecture and algorithm) that can be used to vary the computational effort expended towards generation of the correct (exact) result, and expose them as control knobs in the implementation. These scaling mechanisms can be utilized to achieve improved energy efficiency while maintaining an acceptable (and often, near identical) level of quality of the overall result. A second major tenet of the scalable effort design approach is that fully exploiting the potential of algorithmic resilience requires synergistic cross-layer optimization of scaling mechanisms identified at different levels of design abstraction. We have implemented an energy-efficient SVM classification chip based on the proposed scalable effort design approach. We present results from post-layout simulations and demonstrate that scalable effort hardware can achieve large energy reductions (1.2X-2.2X with no impact on classification accuracy, and 2.2X-4.1X with modest reductions in accuracy) across various sets. Our results also establish that cross-layer optimization leads to much improved energy vs. quality tradeoffs compared to each of the individual techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5523464/","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11453603","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Scalable effort hardware design: Exploiting algorithmic resilience for energy efficiency","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable effort hardware design: Exploiting algorithmic resilience for energy efficiency","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053105S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510861","isNumber":"5522347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510861","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5522347","articleId":"5523464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5523476,"authors":[{"name":"Amith Singhee","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

Thermal hot spots increase leakage, deteriorate timing, and reduce the mean time to failure. To manage runtime thermal variations, circuit designers embed within-die thermal sensors that acquire temperatures at few selected locations. The acquired temperatures are then used to guide runtime thermal management techniques. The capabilities of these techniques are essentially bounded by the spatial thermal resolution of the sensor measurements. In this paper we characterize temperature signals of real processors and demonstrate that on-chip thermal gradients lead to sparse signals in the frequency domain. We exploit this observation to (1) devise thermal sensor allocation techniques, and (2) devise signal reconstruction techniques that fully characterize the thermal status of the processor using the limited number of measurements from the thermal sensors. To verify the accuracy of our methods, we compare our temperature characterization results against thermal measurements acquired from a state-of-the-art infrared camera that captures the mid-band infrared emissions from the back of the die of a 45 nm dual-core processor. Our results show that our techniques are capable of accurately characterizing the temperatures of real processors.","displayPublicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510861/5522347/05523490.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"61","publicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","doi":"10.1145/1837274.1837291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1837274.1837291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522347","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal monitoring of real processors: Techniques for sensor allocation and full characterization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Thermal sensors","Thermal management","Temperature sensors","Runtime","Signal processing","Multicore processing","Timing","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","thermal management (packaging)","thermal variables measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal monitoring","real processors","full characterization","multicore processors","runtime thermal hot spots","thermal sensors","runtime thermal management","on-chip thermal gradients","thermal sensor allocation","signal reconstruction","temperature characterization","thermal measurements","infrared camera","mid-band infrared emissions","dual-core processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Thermal characterization","spectral methods","k-LSE","compressive sensing","sensors allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Thermal monitoring of real processors: Techniques for sensor allocation and full characterization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5523490/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11453610","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal monitoring of real processors: Techniques for sensor allocation and full characterization","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079257S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510861","isNumber":"5522347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510861","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5522347","articleId":"5523490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5523492,"authors":[{"name":"Melvin Breuer","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Melvin","lastName":"Breuer","id":"37273801100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0002-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6677-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0002-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"5523492","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Circuit faults","Degradation","Fabrics","Circuit testing","CMOS technology","Circuit noise","Quantum computing","Propagation losses","Electrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS circuits","Boolean operations","quantum devices","molecular based cells","process variations","mathematical analysis","error-tolerance","performance degradation","CAD issues","technological revolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Performance degradation","error-tolerance","CMOS","computational fabrics","error-rate"]}],"doi":"10.1145/1837274.1837493","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1837274.1837493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522347","publicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510861/5522347/05523492.pdf","startPage":"871","endPage":"876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware that produces bounded rather than exact results","abstract":"Technological achievements have made it possible to: fabricate CMOS circuits with over a billion transistors; implement Boolean operations using quantum devices and/or the spin of an electron; implement transformations using bio and molecular based cells.

Consequently, many systems built from these technologies operate imperfectly. Luckily there are many complex and large-market systems (applications) that tolerate acceptable though not always correct results. In addition, there is emerging a body of mathematical analysis related to imperfect computation. In this paper we first introduce the concepts of acceptable error-tolerance and acceptable performance degradation, and demonstrate how important attributes of these concepts can be quantified. We interlace this discussion with several examples of systems that can effectively employ these two concepts.

When the two sub-swarms evolve steady states independent, a certain amount of particles of the second sub-swarm that are extracted randomly exchange with the worst fitness value of particles of the first sub-swarm, which can increase the information exchange between the particles, improve the diversity of population and meliorate the convergence of algorithm.

As a result, \u201csmall-width\u201d Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors (CNFETs) can have a high probability of containing no semiconducting CNTs, resulting in CNFET failures. Upsizing these vulnerable small-width CNFETs is an expensive design choice since it can result in substantial area/power penalties. This paper introduces a processing/design co-optimization approach to reduce probability of CNFET failures at the chip-level. Large degree of spatial correlation observed in directional CNT growth presents a unique opportunity for such optimization. Maximum benefits from such correlation can be realized by enforcing the active regions of CNFETs to be aligned with each other. This approach relaxes the device-level failure probability requirement by 350X at the 45nm technology node, leading to significantly reduced costs associated with upsizing the small-width CNFETs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carbon nanotube correlation: Promising opportunity for CNFET circuit yield enhancement","publicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","doi":"10.1145/1837274.1837497","displayPublicationTitle":"Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510861/5522347/05523507.pdf","startPage":"889","endPage":"892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1837274.1837497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522347","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Carbon nanotube correlation: Promising opportunity for CNFET circuit yield enhancement","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5523507/","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11453614","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carbon nanotube correlation: Promising opportunity for CNFET circuit yield enhancement","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079361S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510861","isNumber":"5522347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510861","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5522347","articleId":"5523507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5523527,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Jianhui","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Jianhui","id":"37396299000"},{"name":"Ling Weixin","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Weixin","id":"37540377200"},{"name":"He Mincong","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Mincong","id":"37541543800"},{"name":"Chen Zhuoming","affiliation":["Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Zhuoming","id":"37541542000"},{"name":"Ouyang Jingming","affiliation":["Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Ouyang","lastName":"Jingming","id":"37541542800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7280-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7279-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5523527","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Neural networks","Image segmentation","Image analysis","Target recognition","Image processing","Noise robustness","Gravity","Noise reduction","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","image classification","image recognition","image segmentation","neural nets","probability","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian theory","neural networks","video image segmentation method","target recognition","image analysis","class conditional posterior probability estimation","variable step algorithm","moving target diffused searching","noise reduction","image processing method","image classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video image segmentation","Bayesian theory","Neural network","Feature clustering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523527","abstract":"Video image segmentation is essential for image analysis and the target recognition. In this study, a Bayesian theory and neural networks based image processing method was applied to video image segmentation.

Secondly, the location information in the estimation of prior probability played a role in inhibiting the over-segmentation, and made the classifier more robust and flexible. Finally, a variable-step algorithm using the \"Center of gravity\" as the starting point for moving target diffused searching was developed. This algorithm could not only reduce noise, but also avoided the classification of each pixel in every video image, which facilitated to improve the performance of real-time.","doi":"10.1109/ICICTA.2010.399","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521356/5522426/05523527.pdf","startPage":"262","endPage":"265","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Computation Technology and Automation","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Computation Technology and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICTA.2010.399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Hybrid Approach of Bayesian Theory and Neural Networks for Video Image Segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Hybrid Approach of Bayesian Theory and Neural Networks for Video Image Segmentation","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11472275","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5523527/","conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Hybrid Approach of Bayesian Theory and Neural Networks for Video Image Segmentation","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"4077a262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051547S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521356","isNumber":"5522426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521356","xplore-issue":"5522426","articleId":"5523527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5523529,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Nahir","affiliation":["IBM Haifa Research Laboratory, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Nahir","id":"37322170000"},{"name":"Avi Ziv","affiliation":["IBM Haifa Research Laboratory, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Avi","lastName":"Ziv","id":"37282131400"},{"name":"Miron Abramovici","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Miron","lastName":"Abramovici","id":"37283990700"},{"name":"Albert Camilleri","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Camilleri","id":"37088607384"},{"name":"Rajesh Galivanche","affiliation":["Tiger's Lair, Vienna, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Galivanche","id":"37541595300"},{"name":"Bob Bentley","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Bob","lastName":"Bentley","id":"37282153200"},{"name":"Harry Foster","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Harry","lastName":"Foster","id":"37528212200"},{"name":"Alan Hu","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Inc.orporated, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Hu","id":"37274867600"},{"name":"Valeria Bertacco","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, Plano, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Bertacco","id":"37267142300"},{"name":"Shakti Kapoor","affiliation":["IBM, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Shakti","lastName":"Kapoor","id":"37274822000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0002-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6677-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0002-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"5523529","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1326},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Silicon","Hardware","Observability","Computer bugs","Controllability","Costs","Emulation","Engines","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal verification","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pre-silicon verification","post-silicon validation","simulation technique","emulation technique","full-system functional verification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Verification","Validation.

To achieve independent and continuous VVT for each valve, an electromechanical valve drive (EMV) system with a custom-designed limited-angle actuator was proposed previously, whose feasibility with lower power consumption, smaller package, and faster transition was predicted by simulation. In order to validate the concept experimentally, a prototype actuator was built and evaluated in this paper. The fabrication considerations and assembling process of the prototype actuator are discussed before satisfactory experimental results of the whole EMV system with the prototype actuator are presented. A further projection for a full engine valve actuation illustrates a promising future of the EMV system with the limited-angle actuator in a real engine environment up to an engine speed of 6000 rpm.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0193","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510043/5522470/05523618.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A custom-designed limited-angle actuator for an electromechanical engine valve drive part II: Fabrication and evaluation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523618/","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"A custom-designed limited-angle actuator for an electromechanical engine valve drive part II: Fabrication and evaluation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A custom-designed limited-angle actuator for an electromechanical engine valve drive part II: Fabrication and evaluation","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"20100193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042447S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2010","isNumber":"5522470","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510043","articleId":"5523618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5523633,"authors":[{"name":"Kashif Khan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Electrical Machines and Power Electronics Laboratory, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Kashif","lastName":"Khan"},{"name":"Mats Leksell","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Electrical Machines and Power Electronics Laboratory, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Leksell"},{"name":"Oskar Wallmark","affiliation":["Electrical Machines and Power Electronics Laboratory, School of Electrical Engineering, KTH (Royal Institute of Technology), Stockholm, SWEDEN"],"firstName":"Oskar","lastName":"Wallmark"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-84919-231-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5523633","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":418},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523633","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLE","PERMANENT MAGNET MACHINE","RELUCTANCE SYNCHRONOUS MACHINE"]}],"abstract":"The design of permanent-magnet assisted synchronous reluctance machines (PMRSMs) for optimum reluctance and magnetic torque components is a complex task since rotor dimensioning for one torque component (magnet or reluctance torque) limits the possibility to optimize the other torque component.

The IPM-V angle \u03b4 between two magnet pieces within a pole was found to have a significant impact on the optimum split ratio. Smaller values of angle \u03b4 have smaller optimal split ratios and higher torque. However, for torque per magnet volume, a global optimal split ratio and angle \u03b4 can be found within limits. Increasing the magnet thickness for interior PM machines results in a decrease in the magnet width due to geometric limitations and hence there exists an optimal magnet thickness for maximum torque, which is obvious in IPM-V machines. Comparison reveals that the IPM-I machine presents the widest constant power-speed region due to its larger d-axis inductance and low back-EMF. Single layer windings produce larger average torque and d-axis inductance, hence wider power-speed range operation, however exhibits larger torque ripples.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522470","publicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510043/5522470/05523637.pdf","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of optimal design and performance of PM machines having non-overlapping windings and different rotor topologies","doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0201","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of optimal design and performance of PM machines having non-overlapping windings and different rotor topologies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523637/","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of optimal design and performance of PM machines having non-overlapping windings and different rotor topologies","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"20100201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027846S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2010","isNumber":"5522470","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510043","citationCount":"17","articleId":"5523637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5523638,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The polymer exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell and Li-Ion battery hybrid power plant shows a great potential to replace the IC engines from UAVs due to high energy and power densities of the power sources. The power and energy management is an important consideration in PEM fuel cell/ Li-Ion battery hybrid power system to optimize the energy sharing between two power sources. The energy management system (EMS) has long term objectives to maximize the FC net power output by minimizing the oxygen concentration voltage losses. The EMS receives the feedbacks from the battery, the load power and the FC system control parameters. The decisions taken by the EMS are passed to the power management system (PMS) which makes the short term policies to control the power electronic interface (PEI). The PEI is consisted with the bidirectional controller for the battery and the DC boost converter for the PEMFC system. The PMS has rule base system to decide the operating power of the PEMFC system. In addition to that, the PMS decide the bidirectional converter current flow direction to charge or discharge the battery. The EMS system controls the FC system inlet air flow rate by changing the compressor motor voltage to the optimum values. The Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) based online learning and adaptive control algorithms are used to train the existing compressor voltage into the optimum values which are obtained from the reference model. In this power and energy management system, the FC system is operated at optimum power region and the battery supplies the transient power to the propulsion system.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0088","publicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510043/5522470/05523661.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model based power and energy management system for PEM fuel cell/ Li-Ion battery driven propulsion system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Model based power and energy management system for PEM fuel cell/ Li-Ion battery driven propulsion system","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523661/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model based power and energy management system for PEM fuel cell/ Li-Ion battery driven propulsion system","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"20100088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023445S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2010","isNumber":"5522470","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510043","citationCount":"4","articleId":"5523661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5523676,"authors":[{"name":"Dominik Buecherl","affiliation":["Institute for Energy Conversion Technology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Buecherl"},{"name":"Hans-Georg Herzog","affiliation":["Institute for Energy Conversion Technology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Hans-Georg","lastName":"Herzog"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-84919-231-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5523676","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523676","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power train design","scalability","full vehicle simulation","optimization","fuel consumption"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents a full vehicle simulation system utilized for a drive train design process.

With variable frequency permanent magnet generators finding increased roles due to the perceived higher torque density, the issue of rotor integrity becomes a critical issue. Although banding has been previously used in surface mounted PM (SPM) machines, they inevitably increase the airgap and hence reduce the torque capability of the machine. The flux-switching PM (FSPM) machine has been an intense topic of research for many years. By combining its armature and field sources in the stator, its rotor is a passive single piece, salient steel lamination, making it inherently suitable for high speed applications. This paper compares both machines when optimised for high speed applications by designing the rotors of both machines for mechanical integrity and comparing the electromagnetic performance.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0060","publicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510043/5522470/05523679.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of flux switching and surface mounted permanent magnet generators for aerospace applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of flux switching and surface mounted permanent magnet generators for aerospace applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523679/","publicationDate":"April 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of flux switching and surface mounted permanent magnet generators for aerospace applications","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"20100060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025527S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2010","isNumber":"5522470","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510043","citationCount":"7","articleId":"5523679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5523686,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Flywheel discharge times have been computed and drawn for a flywheel rotating at a nominal speed of 9000 rpm and self-discharging down to half-speed (4500 rpm).

In this paper, an optimal region based spatial domain image fusion approach based on selecting sharper regions from the multi-focus source images is proposed. Size of the block type regions are optimized by using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Quantitative and subjective experimental results of different image sets show that proposed method is better than traditional wavelet and Laplacian pyramid based and also genetic algorithm (GA) based methods.","doi":"10.1109/ISCE.2010.5523731","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510864/5522687/05523731.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE 2010)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCE.2010.5523731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending depth-of-field of a digital camera using particle swarm optimization based image fusion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital cameras","Particle swarm optimization","Image fusion","Decision support systems","Consumer electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image fusion","optical focusing","optical sensors","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital camera","particle swarm optimization","camera focus","everywhere-in-focus images","optimal region based spatial domain image fusion","PSO algorithm","genetic algorithm","Laplacian pyramid algorithm","wavelet algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-focus image fusion","extended depth of field","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Extending depth-of-field of a digital camera using particle swarm optimization based image fusion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5523731/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11446167","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extending depth-of-field of a digital camera using particle swarm optimization based image fusion","confLoc":"Braunschweig, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569284439.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060367S","chronDate":"7-10 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510864","isNumber":"5522687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510864","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5522687","articleId":"5523731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5523742,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The pulsating power may shorten the lifetime of the dc-link capacitor and affect the system control performance. This paper has presented some methods to reduce the dc-link voltage ripple caused by the pulsating power in a modular converter for a multi-coil direct-drive permanent magnet wind generator system. At the generator side, the generator coils with 90 degree phase shift are rectified through power factor correction (PFC) circuit and connected in parallel to counteract the pulsating power to achieve the stable dc-link power. At the grid side, the pulsating power frequency (100Hz or 120Hz) will be twice of the grid frequency, which can be compensated by adjusting the wind generator output power, thus reducing the required dc-link capacitor value. A proportional-integral-resonant (PIR) controller is introduced in the dc-link voltage control loop and generator coil current control loop to generator the required pulsating power to compensate the grid-side pulsating power. The corresponding impact of the current harmonics to the generator torque is analyzed in the paper. Meanwhile, the required dc-link capacitor value is also given in the paper. The simulation results validate the proposed control scheme.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0042","publicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510043/5522470/05523776.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC-link voltage ripple reduction for a transformerless modular wind generator system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"DC-link voltage ripple reduction for a transformerless modular wind generator system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523776/","publicationDate":"April 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC-link voltage ripple reduction for a transformerless modular wind generator system","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"20100042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048626S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2010","isNumber":"5522470","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510043","articleId":"5523776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5523778,"authors":[{"name":"Qing-Chang Zhong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Electronics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Qing-Chang","lastName":"Zhong"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-84919-231-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5523778","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":714},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523778","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Variable speed drives","Ward Leonard drive systems","AC machines","synchronverters","inverters that mimic synchronous generators"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the problem of regulating the speed of AC machines in four quadrants is revisited from a completely new viewpoint, based on the idea of powering an AC machine with a synchronous generator that generates a variable-voltage-variable-frequency supply.

A modified nonlinear least squares algorithm identifies and tracks the parameters of the supply voltage over time, ensuring that the supply voltage and the argument of the Park transformation remain synchronized. Experimental results are presented that illustrate the method's effectiveness for identifying changes in the mechanical load on a 3/4 HP refrigeration compressor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523788/","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A park transform-based method for condition monitoring of three-phase electromechanical systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A park transform-based method for condition monitoring of three-phase electromechanical systems","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"20100030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03662S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2010","isNumber":"5522470","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510043","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5523788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5523795,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

The main benefits are reduced overall system mass and ease of manufacturing, due to the use of an air-cored winding, but with a modular PM rotor consisting of C-core modules. A 15kW rotary prototype has been fitted and tested on a commercially available wind turbine. Initial sizing studies for wind indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50% lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [10]. In addition to wind the C-GEN has applications in marine energy converters. The authors are working with four marine developers to investigate the feasibility of C-GEN for their technology. The results from two of those studies will be presented in this paper namely; Aquamarine Oyster device - near shore wave energy converter, Scotrenewables SRTT device - tidal current energy converter. In order to find the most optimum solution for the specific application; electromagnetic, thermal, structural and economical design aspects of the generator are defined and coupled using an analytical design tool. To evaluate different design variations an optimization tool is developed based on genetic algorithm. All these considerations make the optimised generator design a very close optimum solution for the \u201creal-world\u201d.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523799/","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"C-GEN, a lightweight direct drive generator for marine energy converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"C-GEN, a lightweight direct drive generator for marine energy converters","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"20100021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033639S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2010","isNumber":"5522470","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510043","citationCount":"6","articleId":"5523799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5523802,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The proposed control strategy has the aim to define the optimised delay between primary and secondary voltages which allows us to obtain the power instantaneously demanded by the load, ensuring fast dynamic response and maximization of the power/current ratio. The control algorithm is based on algebraic equations derived from the mathematical model of the considered system by means of proper simplifications.

These units consume a large portion of electrical energy produced in our country. The work presented in the paper explore the possibility to minimize the wastage of energy in casting and forging units. A careful study of working of Hammers & Instantaneous load analysis of motors has been carried out to compare with different make equal rating motors. The plant under study had 138 motors of various ratings. The already installed motors have poor efficiency and also operate at poor power factor. There were no efficiency standards for polyphase induction motors. So standard motors were designed with efficiencies high enough to achieve the allowable rise in temperature for the ratings. There is a variation in the efficiency for a given h.p rating from around 74% to 94 %. There is an increasing number of manufacturers who have started making energy efficient motors. We have procured data sheets for these motors and then replaced the existing plant motors with energy efficient motors. Then comparison of standard motors with energy efficient motors based on number of parameters viz. voltage, current, power, power factor has been made.. The costing and payback period for use of energy efficient motors has also been calculated. We have taken various motors already installed in the units and taken readings of rating, Voltage, Current, Power and Power Factor. Then replaced these motors with energy efficient motors and again took the above readings. After this the total tariff was calculated and the payback period was found out. The study reveals that replacing standard motors with energy efficient motors, the total motor load of the plant comes to 804.59kW as compared to 870 kW of the previous arrangement. Besides leading to cost saving, this has also increased the efficiency of the plant.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523816/","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Saving energy using energy efficient motors:A case study","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saving energy using energy efficient motors:A case study","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"20100004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038801S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2010","isNumber":"5522470","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510043","articleId":"5523816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5523821,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Identifying their parameters in a non invasive way is very challenging due to the inherent nonlinearity of machine performance. This paper proposes a synchronous machine parameter identification method using particle swarm optimization (PSO) with a constriction factor. The PSO allows a synchronous machine model output to be used as the objective function to give a new, more efficient method of parameter identification. This paper highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for the identification of synchronous machine model parameters, using both simulation and manufacturers measured experimental data. The paper will also consider the effectiveness of the method as the number of parameters to be identified is increased.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523827/","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Synchronous machine parameter identification using particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronous machine parameter identification using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"20100061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051294S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2010","isNumber":"5522470","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510043","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5523827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5523852,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

It then proceeds to examine the role of damper bars in the level of distortion. The simplified finite element method employed is inclusive of eddy current effects, dynamic field current and full interaction of all MMF sources. It allows accurate total harmonic distortion values to be calculated approximately 25 to 30 times quicker than a fully rotating finite element simulation. Tests have been conducted on eight built machines and results compared to both analytical and alternative finite element methods. The proposed method has an average reduction in error of 55%, compared to an existing analytical method. The presence of damper bars and their position within the pole face is examined, and shown to have a large influence over the level of total harmonic distortion produced.","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["damper","synchronous","generator","harmonic","THD"]}],"doi":"10.1049/cp.2010.0059","publicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510043/5522470/05523852.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2010.0059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open circuit voltage distortion in salient pole synchronous generators with damper windings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"Open circuit voltage distortion in salient pole synchronous generators with damper windings","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523852/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open circuit voltage distortion in salient pole synchronous generators with damper windings","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"20100059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020221S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2010","isNumber":"5522470","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510043","citationCount":"12","articleId":"5523852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5523883,"authors":[{"name":"Hangbing Lv","affiliation":["Microelectronics Department, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hangbing","lastName":"Lv","id":"37533040100"},{"name":"Haijun Wan","affiliation":["Microelectronics Department, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Haijun","lastName":"Wan","id":"37392479100"},{"name":"Tingao Tang","affiliation":["Microelectronics Department, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tingao","lastName":"Tang","id":"37307092900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"5523883","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1228},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Copper","Random access memory","Electrodes","Microelectronics","Tellurium","Conducting materials","Inorganic materials","Material storage","X-ray scattering","Oxidation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium","antimony compounds","copper compounds","germanium compounds","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resistive switching uniformity","continuous resistive switching","resistive random access memory","thin phase-change film","resistive switching stabilization","Ge2Sb2Te5","Al-CuxO-Cu"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Confined filament","resistive random access memory (RRAM)","resistive switching"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523883","abstract":"Broad dispersions of operation parameters are generally observed with continuous resistive switching.

A novel flexible method is developed to solve this problem, extending the recently proposed dictionary-based stochastic expectation maximization approach (developed for a medium-resolution SAR) to very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery, and enhanced by introduction of a novel procedure for estimating the number of mixture components, that permits to reduce appreciably its computational complexity. The specific interest is the estimation of heterogeneous statistics, and the developed method is validated in the case of the VHR SAR imagery, acquired by the last-generation satellite SAR systems, TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed. This VHR imagery allows the appreciation of various ground materials resulting in highly mixed distributions, thus posing a difficult estimation problem that has not been addressed so far. We also conduct an experimental study of the extended dictionary of state-of-the-art SAR-specific pdf models and consider the dictionary refinements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5523885/","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11704549","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Dictionary-Based SAR Amplitude Distribution Estimation and Its Validation With Very High-Resolution Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Dictionary-Based SAR Amplitude Distribution Estimation and Its Validation With Very High-Resolution Data","sourcePdf":"lgrs-krylov-2053517-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04441S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"5673451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5673451","articleId":"5523885","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5523894,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Tao","affiliation":["Institute for Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Tao","id":"37531422300"},{"name":"Yihua Tan","affiliation":["Institute for Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yihua","lastName":"Tan","id":"37289350300"},{"name":"Huajie Cai","affiliation":["Institute for Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Huajie","lastName":"Cai","id":"37537752600"},{"name":"Jinwen Tian","affiliation":["Institute for Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jinwen","lastName":"Tian","id":"37277484300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"5523894","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1553},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Airports","Image edge detection","Image segmentation","Data mining","Object detection","Remote sensing","Clustering algorithms","Roads","Pixel","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airports","geophysical image processing","image recognition","image segmentation","pattern clustering","terrain mapping","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airport detection","large IKONOS images","clustered SIFT keypoints","region information","high spatial resolution IKONOS images","scale invariant feature transform","SIFT matching strategy","region location algorithm","clustering information","image segmentation","prior knowledge"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Airport detection","clustering","high spatial resolution","scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a new method for airport detection from large high-spatial-resolution IKONOS images.

After obtaining SIFT matched keypoints, to both discard the redundant matched points and locate the possible regions of candidates that contain the target, a novel region-location algorithm is proposed, which exploits the clustering information from matched SIFT keypoints, as well as the region information extracted through the image segmentation. Finally, airport recognition is achieved by applying the prior knowledge to the candidate regions.

The obtained result takes into account four major sources of MPI, suggests their physically transparent classification, and enables us to predict the FRA's noise performance for an arbitrary modulated pump. Using the derived expression, we characterize the MPI-induced noise in a typical 80-km span of single-mode optical fiber. Specifically , we examine the noise enhancement in the pulse-pumped amplifier as compared to the amplifier operating in the continuous-wave regime, and analyze its dependence on the on-off gain and the pump-pulse duty cycle. We also estimate the impact of the MPI-induced noise transfer on the amplifier's performance, and discuss the optimal choice of pump modulation for different values of Q-penalty. The results of our study are important for the design optimization of FRAs with time-division-multiplexed pumping.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2061217","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5552243/05523904.pdf","startPage":"2701","endPage":"2707","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2061217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipath Interference in Pulse-Pumped Fiber Raman Amplifiers: Analytical Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2010","displayDocTitle":"Multipath Interference in Pulse-Pumped Fiber Raman Amplifiers: Analytical Approach","volume":"28","issue":"18","htmlLink":"/document/5523904/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2010","accessionNumber":"11489208","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523904/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipath Interference in Pulse-Pumped Fiber Raman Amplifiers: Analytical Approach","sourcePdf":"jlt-rukhlenko-2061217-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09582S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5552243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5552243","articleId":"5523904","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5523907,"authors":[{"name":"Neal Patwari","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Neal Patwari photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Neal","lastName":"Patwari","id":"37284666000"},{"name":"Joey Wilson","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Joey Wilson photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Joey","lastName":"Wilson","id":"37534252800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2256"}],"articleNumber":"5523907","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":211,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":3057},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Wireless sensor networks","Millimeter wave technology","Sensor systems","Signal processing algorithms","RF signals","Area measurement","Position measurement","Electromagnetic measurements","Radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath channels","statistical analysis","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF sensor networks","device-free localization","wireless sensor networks","radio-frequency signals","multipath channels","statistical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fading","multistatic radar","radiowave propagation","sensor systems and applications","signal processing","wireless sensor networks"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we discuss the emerging application of device-free localization (DFL) using wireless sensor networks, which find people and objects in the environment in which the network is deployed, even in buildings and through walls.

In particular, unsupervised situation and subject clustering techniques have been developed that are aided by context information. Situation clustering groups together photos that are similar in terms of capture time and visual content, allowing for the reliable use of visual context information during subject clustering. The aim of subject clustering is to merge multiple face images that belong to the same individual. To take advantage of the availability of multiple face images for a particular individual, we propose effective FR methods that are based on face information fusion strategies. The performance of the proposed annotation method has been evaluated using a variety of photo sets. The photo sets were constructed using 1385 photos from the MPEG-7 Visual Core Experiment 3 (VCE-3) data set and approximately 20000 photos collected from well-known photo-sharing websites. The reported experimental results show that the proposed face annotation method significantly outperforms traditional face annotation solutions at no additional computational cost, with accuracy gains of up to 25% for particular cases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Face Annotation in Personal Photo Collections Using Context-Based Unsupervised Clustering and Face Information Fusion","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2058470","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5599342/05523909.pdf","startPage":"1292","endPage":"1309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2058470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523909/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Face Annotation in Personal Photo Collections Using Context-Based Unsupervised Clustering and Face Information Fusion","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5523909/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11575405","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Face Annotation in Personal Photo Collections Using Context-Based Unsupervised Clustering and Face Information Fusion","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-choi-2058470-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11875S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5599342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5599342","articleId":"5523909","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5523912,"authors":[{"name":"Chan-Won Seo","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5577453/5523912/5523912-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chan-Won Seo (S'09) was born in Incheon, Korea, on March 23, 1982.

For schemes involving hierarchical picture structures, bit allocation, and rate control algorithms are vital components for improving video codec performance. Since conventional bit allocation schemes do not efficiently consider the hierarchical structure characteristics, it is difficult to optimize the video quality at an arbitrary bitrate. Similarly, conventional quantization parameter decision methods are not appropriate for controlling the bitrate generated by a codec using a hierarchical encoding structure. In this paper, we propose an effective bit allocation scheme that assigns the target number of bits to pictures or macroblocks (MBs) and improves the overall quality of images encoded by a hierarchical-based encoder. A rate control scheme is also proposed to ensure that the generated bitrate is equal to the assigned target bitrate. From the simulation results, the proposed schemes outperformed conventional methods from a rate-distortion perspective, by efficiently controlling the bitrate of the MB unit. The algorithms regulated the generated bits to achieve the target bits by using the proposed linear R-Q model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Video coding","Scalability","Quadratic programming","Automatic voltage control","Video codecs","Static VAr compensators","Permission","Quantization","Rate-distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit allocation algorithm","rate control algorithm","hierarchical video coding","hierarchical based encoder","linear R-Q model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit allocation","hierarchical video coding","R-Q model","rate control"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2057011","startPage":"1210","endPage":"1223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5577453/05523912.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2057011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Bit Allocation and Rate Control Algorithms for Hierarchical Video Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Bit Allocation and Rate Control Algorithms for Hierarchical Video Coding","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11527945","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","volume":"20","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5523912/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Bit Allocation and Rate Control Algorithms for Hierarchical Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-han-2057011-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074324S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5577453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5577453","articleId":"5523912","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5523920,"authors":[{"name":"Haibing Yin","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Video Technology, Peking University, Beijing, China","China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5577453/5523920/5523920-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haibing Yin received the Ph.D. degree from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2006.","He was a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the National Engineering Laboratory for Video Technology, Peking University, Beijing.

We examine three commonly used detectors: the acceleration-moving variance detector, the acceleration-magnitude detector, and the angular rate energy detector. We demonstrate that all detectors can be derived within the same general likelihood ratio test (LRT) framework, given the different prior knowledge about the sensor signals. Further, by combining all prior knowledge, we derive a new LRT detector. Subsequently, we develop a methodology to evaluate the performance of the detectors. Employing the developed methodology, we evaluate the performance of the detectors using leveled ground, slow (approximately 3 km/h) and normal (approximately 5 km/h) gait data. The test results are presented in terms of detection versus false-alarm probability. Our preliminary results show that the new detector performs marginally better than the angular rate energy detector that outperforms both the acceleration-moving variance detector and the acceleration-magnitude detector.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-Velocity Detection\u2014An Algorithm Evaluation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2010.2060723","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5601977/05523938.pdf","startPage":"2657","endPage":"2666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2010.2060723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5601977","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523938/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Zero-Velocity Detection\u2014An Algorithm Evaluation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5523938/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11588213","pubMedId":"20667801","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-Velocity Detection\u2014An Algorithm Evaluation","sourcePdf":"tbme-skog-2060723-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081601S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5601977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"333","xplore-issue":"5601977","articleId":"5523938","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":5523939,"authors":[{"name":"Yihong Qi","affiliation":["Research In Motion Limited, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5545546/5523939/5523939-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yihong Qi (M'92) received the B.S. degree in electronics from the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, the M.S. degree in electronics from the Chinese Academy of Space Technology, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics from Xidian University, Xi'an, China.","From 1989 to 1993, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow and then an Associate Professor with Southeast University, Nanjing, China.

These gases have been identified as biomarkers using equipments, such as gas chromatography and electronic nose (e-nose). GC is very accurate but is expensive, time consuming, and nonportable. E-nose has the advantages of low cost and easy operation, but is not particular for analyzing breath odor, and hence, has a limited application in diseases diagnosis. This paper proposes a novel system that is special for breath analysis. We selected chemical sensors that are sensitive to the biomarkers and compositions in human breath, developed the system, and introduced the odor signal preprocessing and classification method. To evaluate the system performance, we captured breath samples from healthy persons and patients known to be afflicted with diabetes, renal disease, and airway inflammation, respectively, and conducted experiments on medical treatment evaluation and disease identification. The results show that the system is not only able to distinguish between breath samples from subjects suffering from various diseases or conditions (diabetes, renal disease, and airway inflammation) and breath samples from healthy subjects, but in the case of renal failure is also helpful in evaluating the efficacy of hemodialysis (treatment for renal failure).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5601977/05523940.pdf","startPage":"2753","endPage":"2763","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2010.2055864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2010.2055864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5601977","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Breath Analysis System Based on Electronic Olfaction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diseases","Gases","Biomarkers","Diabetes","Gas chromatography","Electronic noses","Chemical sensors","Humans","System performance","Medical treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical sensors","chemioception","diseases","medical signal processing","pneumodynamics","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["breath analysis system","electronic olfaction","gases","disease indicators","clinical conditions","biomarkers","gas chromatography","electronic nose","e-nose","breath odor","disease diagnosis","chemical sensors","human breath","odor signal preprocessing","odor signal classification","hemodialysis","renal failure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Breath analysis","chemical sensor","disease identification","electronic olfaction","therapy monitoring"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Biological Markers","Breath Tests","Drug Monitoring","Electronic Nose","Gases","Humans","Organic Chemicals","Renal Dialysis","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Breath Analysis System Based on Electronic Olfaction","volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5523940/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11588214","pubMedId":"20667805","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Breath Analysis System Based on Electronic Olfaction","sourcePdf":"tbme-zhang-2055864-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176861S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5601977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5601977","articleId":"5523940","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5523941,"authors":[{"name":"Mark H.

The forte of \u03b1\u03b2-based search are highly tactical deterministic game domains with a small to moderate branching factor, where efficient yet knowledge-rich evaluation functions can be applied effectively. In this paper, we describe an MCTS-based program for playing the game Lines of Action (LOA), which is a highly tactical slow-progression game exhibiting many of the properties difficult for MCTS. The program uses an improved MCTS variant that allows it to both prove the game-theoretical value of nodes in a search tree and to focus its simulations better using domain knowledge. This results in simulations superior in both handling tactics and ensuring game progression. Using the improved MCTS variant, our program is able to outperform even the world's strongest \u03b1\u03b2-based LOA program. This is an important milestone for MCTS because the traditional game-tree search approach has been considered to be the better suited for playing LOA.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCIAIG.2010.2061050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5688732","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804728/5688732/05523941.pdf","endPage":"250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monte Carlo Tree Search in Lines of Action","doi":"10.1109/TCIAIG.2010.2061050","startPage":"239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Monte Carlo Tree Search in Lines of Action","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523941/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11759860","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5523941/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"2","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monte Carlo Tree Search in Lines of Action","sourcePdf":"tciaig-winands-2061050-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123977S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4804728","isNumber":"5688732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4804728","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5688732","articleId":"5523941","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5523942,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d6zg\u00fc Alay","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5545503/5523942/5523942-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\u00d6zg\u00fc Alay (S'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

However, providing good and stable video quality to a large number of users with varying channel conditions remains elusive. In this paper, an integration of layered video coding, packet level forward error correction, and two-hop relaying is proposed to enable efficient and robust video multicast in infrastructure-based wireless networks. First, transmission with conventional omni-directional antennas is considered where relays have to transmit in non-overlapping time slots in order to avoid collision. In order to improve system efficiency, we next investigate a system in which relays transmit simultaneously using directional antennas. In both systems, we consider a non-layered configuration, where the relays forward all received video packets and all users receive the same video quality, as well as a layered setup, where the relays forward only the base-layer video. For each system setup, we consider optimization of the relay placement, user partition, transmission rates of each hop, and time scheduling between source and relay transmissions. Our analysis shows that the non-layered system can provide better video quality to all users than the conventional direct transmission system, and the layered system enables some users to enjoy significantly better quality, while guaranteeing other users the same or better quality than direct transmission. The directional relay system can provide substantial improvements over the omni-directional relay system. To support our results, a prototype is implemented using open source drivers and socket programming, and the system performance is validated with real-world experiments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Bandwidth","Video coding","Forward error correction","Robustness","Wireless networks","Slot antennas","Transmitting antennas","Directional antennas","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel coding","directive antennas","error correction codes","multicast communication","video coding","video communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["layered wireless video multicast","mobile users","bandwidth efficiency","varying channel conditions","video coding","packet level forward error correction","two-hop relaying","omnidirectional antennas","collision avoidance","nonlayered configuration","video packets","omnidirectional relay system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Directional relays","forward error correction","layered video coding","omni-directional relays","video multicast","wireless networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523942","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2056951","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5545503/05523942.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2056951","startPage":"1095","endPage":"1109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5545503","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layered Wireless Video Multicast Using Relays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Layered Wireless Video Multicast Using Relays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523942/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","volume":"20","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5523942/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11465619","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layered Wireless Video Multicast Using Relays","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-alay-2056951-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07902S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5545503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5545503","articleId":"5523942","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5523952,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Robin Langerak","affiliation":["Image Sciences Institute, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Thomas Robin","lastName":"Langerak","id":"37296581000"},{"name":"Uulke A. van der Heide","affiliation":["Department of Radiotherapy, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Uulke A.","lastName":"van der Heide","id":"37541685600"},{"name":"Alexis N.

Visible images, however, are easily affected by illumination variations, while posed expressions differ in appearance and timing from natural ones. In this paper, we propose and establish a natural visible and infrared facial expression database, which contains both spontaneous and posed expressions of more than 100 subjects, recorded simultaneously by a visible and an infrared thermal camera, with illumination provided from three different directions. The posed database includes the apex expressional images with and without glasses. As an elementary assessment of the usability of our spontaneous database for expression recognition and emotion inference, we conduct visible facial expression recognition using four typical methods, including the eigenface approach [principle component analysis (PCA)], the fisherface approach [PCA + linear discriminant analysis (LDA)], the Active Appearance Model (AAM), and the AAM-based + LDA. We also use PCA and PCA+LDA to recognize expressions from infrared thermal images. In addition, we analyze the relationship between facial temperature and emotion through statistical analysis. Our database is available for research purposes.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2010.2060716","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/5601986/05523955.pdf","startPage":"682","endPage":"691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2010.2060716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5601986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Natural Visible and Infrared Facial Expression Database for Expression Recognition and Emotion Inference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523955/","displayDocTitle":"A Natural Visible and Infrared Facial Expression Database for Expression Recognition and Emotion Inference","volume":"12","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11581344","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5523955/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Natural Visible and Infrared Facial Expression Database for Expression Recognition and Emotion Inference","sourcePdf":"tmm-wang-2060716-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094604S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5601986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"205","xplore-issue":"5601986","articleId":"5523955","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5523962,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Li","affiliation":["School of Instrument Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Li","id":"37539273900"},{"name":"Aiguo Song","affiliation":["School of Instrument Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Aiguo","lastName":"Song","id":"37276033000"},{"name":"Shumin Fei","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Measurement and Control of CSE, Ministry of Education, School of Automation, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shumin","lastName":"Fei","id":"37282845900"},{"name":"Ting Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Measurement and Control of CSE, Ministry of Education, School of Automation, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Wang","id":"37536301000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"5523962","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":632},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523962","abstract":"In this brief, based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach and appropriate integral inequality, a new sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the global stability for delayed neural networks with unbounded distributed delay, in which the improved delay-partitioning technique and general convex combination are employed.

By means of 3-D TCAD simulations, the statistical dispersion of the threshold voltage shift induced by a single localized electron in the nitride is evaluated in presence of non-uniform substrate conduction. The role of 3-D electrostatics and atomistic doping on the results is highlighted, showing the latter as the major spread source. The threshold voltage shift induced by more than one electron in the nitride is then analyzed, showing that for increasing numbers of stored electrons a correlation among single-electron shifts clearly appears.

First, Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models are used to describe the NSV attitude dynamics; then, an actuator-fault model is developed. Next, an adaptive fault-tolerant tracking-control scheme is proposed based on the online estimation of actuator faults, in which a compensation control term is introduced in order to reduce the effect of actuator faults. Compared with some existing results of fault-tolerant control (FTC) in nonlinear systems, the technique presented in this paper is not dependent on fault detection and isolation (FDI) mechanism and is easy to implement in aerospace-engineering applications. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed FTC scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5594723/05523968.pdf","startPage":"1000","endPage":"1007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2058808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2058808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5594723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Tracking Control of Near-Space Vehicle Using Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Actuators","Space vehicles","Fuzzy control","Adaptive control","Vehicle dynamics","Aerodynamics","Fault detection","Attitude control","Takagi-Sugeno model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","aircraft","fault tolerance","fuzzy control","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive fault-tolerant tracking control","near-space vehicle","Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models","actuator-fault model","online estimation","nonlinear systems","fault detection","fault isolation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Actuator faults","adaptive control","fault-tolerant tracking control","Takagi\u2013Sugeno (T\u2013S) fuzzy models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523968/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Tracking Control of Near-Space Vehicle Using Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Models","volume":"18","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11560841","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Tracking Control of Near-Space Vehicle Using Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Models","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-jiang-2058808-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06448S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","isNumber":"5594723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"320","articleId":"5523968","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":5523972,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The study of sea ice and snow surface emissivities at Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) frequencies has been the focus of two airborne campaigns carried out by the Met Office over the past decade to promote the assimilation of lower tropospheric sounding radiances over the polar regions. The Polar Experiment (POLEX) campaign occurred during March 2001. Five flights were carried out over the Arctic Ocean north of Svalbard. The Cold Land Processes II (CLPX-II) campaign took place during February 2008. The sea ice portion of CLPX-II consisted of four flights sampling the emissivities and effective temperatures in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas and frozen wetlands near Barrow, Alaska. This paper summarizes the findings of a recent analysis from the CLPX-II and POLEX campaigns. First, time series of Lambertian emissivities and effective temperatures at MHS frequencies are retrieved for each flight. These time series and the satellite imagery are then used to classify the surfaces over flown. The behaviors of the emissivity spectra with changing surface type are discussed in terms of changes in the ice and snow conditions on the surface. The difference between 89- and 157-GHz emissivities is found to be related to both the snow depth and the relative amounts of depth hoar and wind slab within the snowpack.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2051555","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5738422/05523972.pdf","startPage":"1223","endPage":"1237","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2051555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sea Ice Emissivities and Effective Temperatures at MHS Frequencies: An Analysis of Airborne Microwave Data Measured During Two Arctic Campaigns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Sea Ice Emissivities and Effective Temperatures at MHS Frequencies: An Analysis of Airborne Microwave Data Measured During Two Arctic Campaigns","volume":"49","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5523972/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11883187","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523972/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sea Ice Emissivities and Effective Temperatures at MHS Frequencies: An Analysis of Airborne Microwave Data Measured During Two Arctic Campaigns","sourcePdf":"tgrs-harlow-2051555-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089999S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5738422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5738422","articleId":"5523972","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5523973,"authors":[{"name":"Jaewan Choi","affiliation":["Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5673442/5523973/5523973-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jaewan Choi received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in civil, urban, and geo-system engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2006, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.","His research interests include image processing of remote sensing data, image fusion, and image registration."]},"firstName":"Jaewan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37066877700"},{"name":"Kiyun Yu","affiliation":["Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5673442/5523973/5523973-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Kiyun Yu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in civil engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, and the Ph.D. degree in geographic information systems from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 1998.","He was a Director in the Ministry of Construction and Transportation until 2000.

In previous research, various algorithms have been proposed. Although they have been successful, there are still some margins of spatial and spectral quality that can be improved. In addition, a new method that can be used for various types of sensors is required. In this paper, a new adaptive fusion method based on component substitution is proposed to merge a high-spatial-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a multispectral image. This method generates high-/low-resolution synthetic component images by partial replacement and uses statistical ratio-based high-frequency injection. Various remote sensing satellite images, such as IKONOS-2, QuickBird, LANDSAT ETM+, and SPOT-5, were employed in the evaluation. Experiments showed that this approach can resolve spectral distortion problems and successfully conserve the spatial information of a PAN image. Thus, the fused image obtained from the proposed method gave higher fusion quality than the images from some other methods. In addition, the proposed method worked efficiently with the different sensors considered in the evaluation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"49","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11704642","htmlLink":"/document/5523973/","displayDocTitle":"A New Adaptive Component-Substitution-Based Satellite Image Fusion by Using Partial Replacement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Adaptive Component-Substitution-Based Satellite Image Fusion by Using Partial Replacement","sourcePdf":"tgrs-kim-2051674-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120624S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5673442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"248","xplore-issue":"5673442","articleId":"5523973","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":5523974,"authors":[{"name":"Mariv\u00ed Tello Alonso","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Laboratory, Department of Signal Theory and Communications (TSC), Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5673442/5523974/5523974-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mariv\u00ed Tello Alonso (S'03) was born in Barcelona, Spain.

The proposed method is divided into two stages: 1) cloud/snow classification and 2) training and land cover classification. The purpose of the cloud/snow classification stage is to determine which pixels are missing due to clouds and snow. All pixels in each optical image are classified into the classes cloud, snow, water, and vegetation using a suitable classifier. The pixels classified as cloud or snow are labeled as missing, and this information is used in the subsequent training and classification stage, which deals with classification of the pixels into various land cover classes. For land cover classification, we apply the maximum-likelihood (assuming normal distributions), -nearest neighbor, and Parzen classifiers, all modified to handle missing features. The classifiers are evaluated on Landsat (both Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) images covering a scene at about 900 m a.s.l. in the Hardangervidda mountain plateau in Southern Norway, where 4869 in situ samples of the land cover classes water, ridge, leeside, snowbed, mire, forest, and rock are obtained. The results show that proper modeling of the missing pixels improves the classification rate by 5%-10%, and by using multiple images, we increase the chance of observing the land cover type substantially. The nonparametric classifiers handle nonignorable missing-data mechanisms and are therefore particularly suitable for remote sensing applications where the pixels covered by snow and cloud may depend on the land cover type.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Snow","Pixel","Optical sensors","Vegetation mapping","Satellites","Remote sensing","Parameter estimation","Statistical analysis","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image classification","maximum likelihood estimation","terrain mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land cover classification","cloud contaminated multitemporal high resolution images","missing optical data","cloud classification","snow classification","training","optical image pixel classification","maximum likelihood classifier","nearest neighbor classifier","Parzen classifier","Landsat Thematic Mapper images","Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images","Hardangervidda mountain plateau","southern Norway","water land cover class","ridge land cover class","leeside land cover class","snowbed land cover class","mire land cover class","forest land cover class","rock land cover class"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clouds","image restoration","land cover classification","missing data","multitemporal"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2052464","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5673441/05523975.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5673441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2052464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Land Cover Classification of Cloud-Contaminated Multitemporal High-Resolution Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Land Cover Classification of Cloud-Contaminated Multitemporal High-Resolution Images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523975/","volume":"49","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5523975/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11704631","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Land Cover Classification of Cloud-Contaminated Multitemporal High-Resolution Images","sourcePdf":"tgrs-salberg-2052464-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127525S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5673441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5673441","articleId":"5523975","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5523977,"authors":[{"name":"Beril Sirmacek","affiliation":["Department of Photogrammetry and Image Analysis, German AeroSpace Center (DLR), Remote Sensing Technology Institute, Wessling, Germany","Computer Vision Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5673442/5523977/5523977-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Beril S\u0131rma\u00e7ek (S'07) received the B.Sc. and M.S. degrees from the Y\u0131ld\u0131z Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2006 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Yeditepe University, Istanbul, in 2009.","During her Ph.D. study, she was a Research and Teaching Assistant with Yeditepe University, where she was also a member of the Computer Vision Research Laboratory.

Although it is possible to manually locate buildings from these VHR images, this operation may not be robust and fast. Therefore, automated systems to detect buildings from VHR aerial and satellite images are needed. Unfortunately, such systems must cope with major problems. First, buildings have diverse characteristics, and their appearance (illumination, viewing angle, etc.) is uncontrolled in these images. Second, buildings in urban areas are generally dense and complex. It is hard to detect separate buildings from them. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel building detection method using local feature vectors and a probabilistic framework. We first introduce four different local feature vector extraction methods. Extracted local feature vectors serve as observations of the probability density function (pdf) to be estimated. Using a variable-kernel density estimation method, we estimate the corresponding pdf. In other words, we represent building locations (to be detected) in the image as joint random variables and estimate their pdf. Using the modes of the estimated density, as well as other probabilistic properties, we detect building locations in the image. We also introduce data and decision fusion methods based on our probabilistic framework to detect building locations. We pick certain crops of VHR panchromatic aerial and Ikonos satellite images to test our method. We assume that these crops are detected using our previous urban region detection method. Our test images are acquired by two different sensors, and they have different spatial resolutions. Also, buildings in these images have diverse characteristics. Therefore, we can test our methods on a diverse data set. Extensive tests indicate that our method can be used to automatically detect buildings in a robust and fast manner in Ikonos satellite and our aerial images.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2053713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2053713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5673442","startPage":"211","endPage":"221","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5673442/05523977.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523977","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Testing","Robustness","Feature extraction","Crops","Image resolution","Urban planning","Image analysis","Lighting","Urban areas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","geophysical image processing","object detection","probability","town and country planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic framework","aerial images","satellite images","map making","urban planning","land use analysis","building detection method","feature vector extraction methods","probability density function","variable-kernel density estimation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aerial images","building detection","data fusion","decision fusion","Ikonos satellite images","kernel density estimation","local feature vectors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Probabilistic Framework to Detect Buildings in Aerial and Satellite Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11725485","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5523977/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523977/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Probabilistic Framework to Detect Buildings in Aerial and Satellite Images","sourcePdf":"tgrs-unsalan-2053713-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140385S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5673442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"5673442","articleId":"5523977","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":5523999,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Lin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5747179/5523999/5523999-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yen-Lin Chen (S'02\u2013M'07) was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 1978.

The proposed method identifies vehicles by detecting and locating vehicle headlights and taillights using image segmentation and pattern analysis techniques. First, a fast bright-object segmentation process based on automatic multilevel histogram thresholding is applied to effectively extract bright objects of interest. This automatic multilevel thresholding approach provides a robust and adaptable detection system that operates well under various nighttime illumination conditions. The extracted bright objects are then processed by a spatial clustering and tracking procedure that locates and analyzes the spatial and temporal features of vehicle light patterns, and identifies and classifies moving cars and motorbikes in traffic scenes. The proposed real-time vision system has also been implemented and evaluated on a TI DM642 DSP-based embedded platform. The system is set up on elevated platforms to perform traffic surveillance on real highways and urban roads. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed traffic surveillance approach is feasible and effective for vehicle detection and identification in various nighttime environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5747179/05523999.pdf","startPage":"2030","endPage":"2044","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2055771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2055771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5747179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5523999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Real-Time Vision System for Nighttime Vehicle Detection and Traffic Surveillance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Machine vision","Vehicle detection","Surveillance","Forward error correction","Digital video broadcasting","Mobile TV","Robustness","Fading","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","night vision","real-time systems","traffic information systems","vehicles","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time vision system","nighttime vehicle detection","traffic surveillance","image segmentation","pattern analysis techniques","fast bright-object segmentation process","automatic multilevel histogram thresholding","spatial clustering and tracking procedure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Traffic information system","traffic surveillance","nighttime surveillance","vehicle detection","vehicle tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5523999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Real-Time Vision System for Nighttime Vehicle Detection and Traffic Surveillance","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5523999/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11929552","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Real-Time Vision System for Nighttime Vehicle Detection and Traffic Surveillance","sourcePdf":"tie-chen-2055771-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.22421S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5747179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"5747179","articleId":"5523999","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5524000,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5765746/5524000/5524000-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qi Li (S'10) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2006, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","In 2009, he was with the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, where he did research.

However, from the fairness point of view, it can be argued that all vehicles at a signalized intersection should have equal passing opportunities. In this correspondence paper, a two-stage fuzzy logic control model for an isolated signalized intersection has been proposed, where both traffic efficiency and fairness have been considered simultaneously. At the first stage, a green-phase selector has been developed to select the subsequent green phase. At the second stage, a green-time adjustor has been proposed to determine the green time for the selected phase. An offline genetic algorithm (GA) has been developed to optimize the fuzzy rules and membership functions of the two controllers. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the vehicle-actuated control model and the model proposed by Pappis and Mamdani in 1977 in terms of both traffic efficiency and fairness. The performance of the proposed model can be further improved after its rules and membership functions are optimized by using GA.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/5624826/05524018.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2052606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2052606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5524018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Stage Fuzzy Logic Controller for Signalized Intersection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Traffic control","Roads","Vehicles","Genetic algorithms","Fuzzy control","Communication system traffic control","Laboratories","Mathematical model","Turning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","road traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two stage fuzzy logic controller","fairness point","equal passing opportunities","isolated signalized intersection","traffic efficiency","green phase selector","green time adjustor","genetic algorithm","GA","fuzzy rules","vehicle actuated control model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","genetic algorithm (GA)","signalized intersection","traffic control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Two-Stage Fuzzy Logic Controller for Signalized Intersection","volume":"41","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5524018/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11630123","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Stage Fuzzy Logic Controller for Signalized Intersection","sourcePdf":"tsmca-qiao-2052606-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077892S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"5624826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5624826","articleId":"5524018","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5524021,"authors":[{"name":"Crist\u00f3bal Romero","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of C\u00f3rdoba, Cordoba, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/5593938/5524021/5524021-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Crist\u00f3bal Romero (M'09) received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of Granada, Granada, Spain, in 1996 and 2003, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of C\u00f3rdoba, C\u00f3rdoba, Spain.

The purpose of illumination sensing is to identify the illumination contributions of spatially distributed LEDs at a sensor location, within a limited response time. In the FDM scheme, LEDs render periodical illumination pulse trains at different frequencies with prescribed duty cycles. The problem of interest is to estimate the amplitudes of the individual illumination pulse trains. In our previous work, an estimation approach was proposed using the fundamental frequency component of the sensor signal. The number of LEDs that can be supported by this estimation approach is limited to around 100 LEDs at a response time of 0.1 s. For future LED lighting systems, however, it is desirable to support many more LEDs. To this end, in this paper, we seek to exploit multiple harmonics in the sensor signal. We first derive upper limits on the number of LEDs that can be supported in the presence of frequency offsets and noise. Thereafter, we propose a low complexity successive estimation approach that effectively exploits the multiple harmonics. It is shown that the number of the LEDs can be increased by a factor of at least five, compared to the estimation approach using only the fundamental frequency component, at the same estimation error.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2059018","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"5508","endPage":"5522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2059018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599326","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5599326/05524025.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Light emitting diodes","LED lamps","Frequency estimation","Frequency division multiplexing","Delay","Permission","Pulse width modulation","Estimation error","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiplexing","LED lamps","lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced illumination sensing","multiple harmonics","LED lighting systems","frequency division multiplexing","light emitting diode lighting systems","spatially distributed LED","LED render periodical illumination pulse trains","sensor signal","frequency offsets","FDM","time 0.1 s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound","frequency division multiplexing","illumination sensing","light emitting diode lighting systems","successive estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Illumination Sensing Using Multiple Harmonics for LED Lighting Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524025/","volume":"58","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5524025/","accessionNumber":"11575495","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Illumination Sensing Using Multiple Harmonics for LED Lighting Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-yang-2059018-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081456S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5599326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5599326","articleId":"5524025","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5524033,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279443700"},{"name":"Q.

The proposed DPC strategy employs a nonlinear sliding mode control (SMC) scheme to directly calculate the required converter's control voltage so as to eliminate the instantaneous errors of active and reactive powers without involving any rotating coordinate transformations. Meanwhile, there are no extra current control loops involved, which simplifies the system design and enhances the transient performance. Constant converter switching frequency is achieved by using space vector modulation, which eases the design of the ac harmonic filter. Simulation and experimental results are provided and compared with those of the classic voltage-oriented vector control (VC) and conventional lookup table (LUT) DPC strategies. The proposed SMC-DPC is capable of providing enhanced transient performance similar to that of the LUT-DPC, and keeps the steady-state harmonic spectra at the same level as those of the VC scheme. The robustness of the proposed DPC to line inductance variations is also inspected during active and reactive power changes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Active and Reactive Power Regulation of Grid-Connected DC/AC Converters Using Sliding Mode Control Approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2057518","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5677632/05524037.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2057518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5677632","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5524037","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524037/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Direct Active and Reactive Power Regulation of Grid-Connected DC/AC Converters Using Sliding Mode Control Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5524037/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11728039","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Active and Reactive Power Regulation of Grid-Connected DC/AC Converters Using Sliding Mode Control Approach","sourcePdf":"tpel-hu-2057518-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076826S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5677632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"204","xplore-issue":"5677632","articleId":"5524037","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":5524045,"authors":[{"name":"Hung Nguyen-Le","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/5623279/5524045/5524045-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hung Nguyen-Le received the B.Eng. degree (1st Class Honors) and the M.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.

In particular, the recursive-least-squares (RLS) and maximum-likelihood (ML) techniques are used to facilitate the Fisher estimation implementations. For the Bayesian estimation, the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) principle is employed in formulating the joint estimation problem. With known channel statistics, the MAP-based estimation is expected to provide better performance than the RLS- and ML-based ones. To avoid a possible identifiability issue in the joint estimation problem, various basis expansion models (BEMs) are deployed as fitting parametric models for capturing the time-variation of the channels. Numerical results and related Bayesian Cram\u00e9r Rao bounds (BCRB) demonstrate that the deployment of BEMs is able to alleviate performance degradation in the considered estimation techniques using the conventional block-fading assumption over time-varying channels. Among the considered schemes, the MAP-based estimation using the discrete prolate spheroidal (DPS) or Karhuen Lo\u00e8ve (KL) basis functions would be the best choice that can provide mean-squared-error (MSE) performance comparable to BCRB in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions (e.g., coded OFDM transmissions).","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2010.2055673","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/5623279/05524045.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2010.2055673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623279","startPage":"514","endPage":"522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot-Aided Joint CFO and Doubly-Selective Channel Estimation for OFDM Transmissions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5524045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pilot-Aided Joint CFO and Doubly-Selective Channel Estimation for OFDM Transmissions","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524045/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11661156","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5524045/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot-Aided Joint CFO and Doubly-Selective Channel Estimation for OFDM Transmissions","sourcePdf":"tbc-nguyenle-2055673-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109834S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"5623279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5623279","articleId":"5524045","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5524050,"authors":[{"name":"Ruili Dong","affiliation":["College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ruili","lastName":"Dong","id":"37402628900"},{"name":"Yonghong Tan","affiliation":["College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yonghong","lastName":"Tan","id":"37363926300"},{"name":"Hongdong Wu","affiliation":["Kinco Electric (Shenzhen) Limited, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Hongdong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37537949900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5195-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5196-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-3449"}],"articleNumber":"5524050","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Friction","Neurons","Nonlinear systems","Automatic control","Automation","Manufacturing systems","Mechanical systems","Limit-cycles","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["friction","gradient methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","mechanical variables control","multilayer perceptrons","neurocontrollers","position control","process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["X-Y macro-positioning stage","nonsmooth neural networks","friction","training algorithm","generalized gradient technique"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5524050","abstract":"In this paper, a novel neutral-network-based model is proposed to describe an X-Y macro-positioning stage.

The decision-support tool optimizes energy services provision by enabling end users to first assign values to desired energy services, and then scheduling their available distributed energy resources (DER) to maximize net benefits. We chose particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve the corresponding optimization problem because of its straightforward implementation and demonstrated ability to generate near-optimal schedules within manageable computation times. We improve the basic formulation of cooperative PSO by introducing stochastic repulsion among the particles. The improved DER schedules are then used to investigate the potential consumer value added by coordinated DER scheduling. This is computed by comparing the end-user costs obtained with the enhanced algorithm simultaneously scheduling all DER, against the costs when each DER schedule is solved separately. This comparison enables the end users to determine whether their mix of energy service needs, available DER and electricity tariff arrangements might warrant solving the more complex coordinated scheduling problem, or instead, decomposing the problem into multiple simpler optimizations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524053/","volume":"1","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5524053/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11476902","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Scheduling of Residential Distributed Energy Resources to Optimize Smart Home Energy Services","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Scheduling of Residential Distributed Energy Resources to Optimize Smart Home Energy Services","sourcePdf":"tsg-pedrasa-2053053-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13017S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"5552162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"598","xplore-issue":"5552162","articleId":"5524053","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5524054,"authors":[{"name":"Jiyi Chen","affiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Jiyi Chen received the B.S. degree at Peking University, China.

The transmitter simultaneously transmits an information-bearing signal to the intended receiver and artificial noise to the eavesdroppers. We obtain an analytical closed-form expression of an achievable secrecy rate and use it as the objective function to optimize the transmit power allocation between the information signal and the artificial noise. Our analytical and numerical results show that equal power allocation is a simple yet near-optimal strategy for the case of noncolluding eavesdroppers. When the number of colluding eavesdroppers increases, more power should be used to generate the artificial noise. We also provide an upper bound on the SNR, above which, the achievable secrecy rate is positive and shows that the bound is tight at low SNR. Furthermore, we consider the impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI) at both the transmitter and the receiver and find that it is wise to create more artificial noise to confuse the eavesdroppers than to increase the signal strength for the intended receiver if the CSI is not accurately obtained.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2059057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2059057","startPage":"3831","endPage":"3842","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5601981/05524086.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5601981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Transmission With Artificial Noise Over Fading Channels: Achievable Rate and Optimal Power Allocation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Secure Transmission With Artificial Noise Over Fading Channels: Achievable Rate and Optimal Power Allocation","volume":"59","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11588242","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5524086/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Transmission With Artificial Noise Over Fading Channels: Achievable Rate and Optimal Power Allocation","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhou-2059057-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06919S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5601981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"396","xplore-issue":"5601981","articleId":"5524086","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5524087,"authors":[{"name":"Yen Kheng Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Yen Kheng Tan (S'02) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore, in 2003 and the Master of technological design (Mechatronics Engineering) degree jointly offered by NUS and the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), Eindhoven, The Netherlands, in 2006.

The proposed power management circuit has two distinct features: 1) an active rectifier using MOSFETs for rectifying the low amplitude ac voltage generated by the wind turbine generator under low wind speed condition efficiently and 2) a dc-dc boost converter with resistor emulation algorithm to perform maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under varying wind-speed conditions. As compared to the conventional diode-bridge rectifier, it is shown that the efficiency of the active rectifier with a low input voltage of 1.2 V has been increased from 40% to 70% due to the significant reduction in the ON-state voltage drop (from 0.6 to 0.15 V) across each pair of MOSFETs used. The proposed robust low-power microcontroller-based resistance emulator is implemented with closed-loop resistance feedback control to ensure close impedance matching between the source and the load, resulting in an efficient power conversion. From the experimental test results obtained, an average electrical power of 7.86 mW is harvested by the optimized WEH system at an average wind speed of 3.62 m/s, which is almost four times higher than the conventional energy harvesting method without using the MPPT.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2056700","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5677632/05524087.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5677632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2056700","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","startPage":"38","endPage":"50","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Wind Energy Harvesting System Using Resistance Emulator and Active Rectifier for Wireless Sensor Nodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5524087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Wind Energy Harvesting System Using Resistance Emulator and Active Rectifier for Wireless Sensor Nodes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524087/","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5524087/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11728030","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Wind Energy Harvesting System Using Resistance Emulator and Active Rectifier for Wireless Sensor Nodes","sourcePdf":"tpel-panda-2056700-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142457S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5677632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"5677632","articleId":"5524087","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5524094,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Hwan You","affiliation":["Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Hwan","lastName":"You","id":"37269122600"},{"name":"Kyung-Taek Lee","affiliation":["Advanced Mobile Technology Research Center, Korea Electronic Technology Institute, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung-Taek","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293708800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"5524094","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":442},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an improved sampling frequency offset (SFO) estimation scheme for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based digital radio mondiale (DRM) broadcasting systems.

The controller utilizes an internal, nonlinear autorotation model and is capable of handling input and output constraints that directly map to quality, efficiency and safety requirements. The RNN is employed to achieve real-time operation because it is capable of improving convergence performance, especially when hardware that supports task parallelization is available. This is of major importance when dealing with small unmanned helicopters with limited onboard computational power, where high update rates are required to successfully perform the autorotation maneuver. The proposed NMPC/RNN combination signifies the first use of a nonlinear model for online autorotation trajectory optimization, thus allowing for easier adaptation to other helicopter types without the need for retraining as in the case of machine learning techniques used by the state-of-the-art. An additional novelty of this research concerns the use of an objective function designed to eliminate the risk of fatalities to people on the ground. This is in contrast to previous works where the goal was to save the aircraft and is achieved by appropriately lowering the kinetic energy of the helicopter during the last phase of its descent. The paper discusses in detail the general design of the NMPC/RNN, before going into the specifics regarding the derivation, implementation and integration of the autonomous autorotation controller itself. The performance of the latter is validated using extensive simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2010.2054092","startPage":"818","endPage":"831","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2010.2054092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5888505","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5888505/05524095.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Model Predictive Control With Neural Network Optimization for Autonomous Autorotation of Small Unmanned Helicopters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524095/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Model Predictive Control With Neural Network Optimization for Autonomous Autorotation of Small Unmanned Helicopters","volume":"19","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5524095/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12063123","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Model Predictive Control With Neural Network Optimization for Autonomous Autorotation of Small Unmanned Helicopters","sourcePdf":"tcst-dalamagkidis-2054092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095548S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5888505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5888505","articleId":"5524095","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5524101,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Power Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yang Wang (S'10) received the B.Sc. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Applied Electronic Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2006, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include short-term load forecasting and SCUC."]},"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Wang","id":"38508820300"},{"name":"Qing Xia","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Power Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Qing Xia (M'01\u2013SM'08) received the Ph.D. degree from the Electrical Engineering Department of Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1989.","He is currently a Professor at Tsinghua University.

Adaptive controllers, on the other hand, are online schemes that effectively learn to compensate for unknown system dynamics and disturbances. Generally, direct adaptive schemes do not converge to optimal control solutions for user-prescribed performance measures. During the past years, it has been shown that reinforcement learning techniques from computational intelligence can be used to learn optimal feedback controllers online using direct adaptive control techniques without knowing the system dynamics. Most reinforcement learning methods require full measurements of the system internal state. In this paper we develop reinforcement learning methods which require only output feedback and yet converge to an optimal controller. Deterministic linear time-invariant systems are considered. Both policy iteration (PI) and value iteration (VI) algorithms are derived. This corresponds to optimal control for a class of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). It is shown that, similar to Q-learning, the new output-feedback optimal learning methods have the important advantage that knowledge of the system dynamics is not needed for their implementation. Only the order of the system must be known and an upper bound on its `observability index'. The learned output feedback controller is in the form of a polynomial ARMA controller that has equivalent performance with the optimal state variable feedback gain.","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2010.5524211","publicationTitle":"IEEE ICCA 2010","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE ICCA 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510862/5523980/05524211.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2010.5524211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5523980","startPage":"2138","endPage":"2145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal adaptive control for unknown systems using output feedback by reinforcement learning methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5524211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal adaptive control for unknown systems using output feedback by reinforcement learning methods","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524211/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11446329","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5524211/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal adaptive control for unknown systems using output feedback by reinforcement learning methods","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"0219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082292S","chronDate":"9-11 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510862","isNumber":"5523980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510862","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5523980","articleId":"5524211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5524235,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-zhou Li","affiliation":["Fac. of Electromech.

It is indicated that captures among neurons act on image filtering to a certain extent through research on the work principle of pulse coupled neural network, and the capability and characteristic of filtering noises are discussed. For filtered sonar image, edge is detected by selecting complex way of generalized morphology opening-closing operation. Then experimental results are given which show that the filter performance of the proposed approach is significantly superior to traditional filter approaches and the proposed morphology edge detection approach can ensure the continuity, integrity and accurate positioning of the edge of underwater sonar image.

The system's nonlinear behavior is described with a bilinear subspace predictor structure in MPC framework. Thus, the MPC formulation results in a fixed structure objective function with constraints regardless of the underlying nonlinearity. Therefore, a bilinear predictive control is implemented by exploiting the structural properties of the identified bilinear subspace predictor model. The open-loop optimization problem of MPC that is nonlinear in nature is solved with series quadratic programming (SQP) without any approximations. These improvements and closely integration of modeling and control also eliminate the intermediate design step, which provides a means for data-driven controller design in generalized predictive controller (GPC) framework.

To account for it, a PSO-based algorithm is proposed by fully utilizing the capability of the exploration search and fast convergence. To fit the continuous PSO in the discrete modeled problem, a novel solution representation is introduced in the algorithm.

Finally, the results are applied to a typical chain networked mechanical systems composing of six MSD oscillators and numerical simulations are given to verify the correctness of the theoretical results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5523980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2010.5524382","publicationTitle":"IEEE ICCA 2010","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE ICCA 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510862/5523980/05524382.pdf","startPage":"1589","endPage":"1594","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2010.5524382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization in networked mass-spring-damper oscillator systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization in networked mass-spring-damper oscillator systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5524382/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11446482","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524382/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization in networked mass-spring-damper oscillator systems","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"0481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062267S","chronDate":"9-11 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510862","isNumber":"5523980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510862","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5523980","articleId":"5524382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5524407,"authors":[{"name":"Pham Thuong Cat","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, Viet Nam Academy of Science and Technology, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"],"firstName":"Pham Thuong","lastName":"Cat","id":"37396639300"},{"name":"Le Hung Linh","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Thai Nguyen University, Thai Nguyen, Viet Nam"],"firstName":"Le Hung","lastName":"Linh","id":"37086150671"},{"name":"Minhtuan Pham","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, Viet Nam Academy of Science and Technology, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"],"firstName":"Minhtuan","lastName":"Pham","id":"37085484706"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5195-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5196-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-3449"}],"articleNumber":"5524407","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Velocity control","Artificial neural networks","AC motors","Mathematical model","Control systems","Sliding mode control","Induction motors","Pulse width modulation inverters","Magnetic variables control","Synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","induction motors","Lyapunov methods","machine control","neurocontrollers","unsupervised learning","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speed control","3-phase asynchronous motor","artificial neural network","alternating current motor","AC motor","online self-learning algorithm","asymptotic stability","Lyapunov stability method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5524407","abstract":"Speed control of an alternating current (AC) motor has been one of the difficult control problems.

Saving energy and real-time performance deserve research for low-cost sensor nodes in the target tracking application. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic-group idea and apply it to our scheduling scheme. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is employed to predict tracking accuracy, and an energy model is adopted to predict the energy consumption. Simulation results show that, compared with the information-driven sensor quering (IDSQ) and the adaptive sensor scheduling strategy, the proposed scheme can achieve significant improvement on real-time property and tracking accuracy for target tracking in WSN. At the same time, it approaches to the adaptive sensor scheduling strategy in energy

We show the ease of applicability of inexpensive and robust standard game controllers for 3D object tracking, e.g. to track an infrared source in 3D space. Recovering the 3D information using stereo vision is still one of the major research areas in computer vision and has given rise to a great deal of literature in the recent past. In this paper we present the method for calibrating a WIIMOTE stereo pair without knowing any parameters of the build-in infrared cameras in advance. The results are two matrices which includes both the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters for left and right cameras. The comparison between the stereo and the mono WIIMOTE tracking system is presented. Furthermore, to demonstrate the use of the WIIMOTE stereo system we considered the task of throwing a ball with robotic hand, to the target identified with an infrared source. The throwing task was divided into two separate parts: the tracking part and the throwing part.","doi":"10.1109/RAAD.2010.5524560","publicationTitle":"19th International Workshop on Robotics in Alpe-Adria-Danube Region (RAAD 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"19th International Workshop on Robotics in Alpe-Adria-Danube Region (RAAD 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512514/5524532/05524560.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAAD.2010.5524560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5524532","startPage":"357","endPage":"362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time 3D marker tracking with a WIIMOTE stereo vision system: Application to robotic throwing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5524560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time 3D marker tracking with a WIIMOTE stereo vision system: Application to robotic throwing","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524560/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11446934","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5524560/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time 3D marker tracking with a WIIMOTE stereo vision system: Application to robotic throwing","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"60raad2010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064083S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512514","isNumber":"5524532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512514","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5524532","articleId":"5524560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5524583,"authors":[{"name":"N.

One possible solution that has already been demonstrated for navigation on flat surfaces has been the use of Particle Swarm Optimization, PSO. This document aims to present results obtained from experiments gauging the adequacy of PSO for path planning in rough terrain environments. The PSO algorithm is set up to choose paths composed of straight line segments. A Controller is then used in a simulator to guide our vehicle along each path and the quality of the route traversed is then used to evaluate each path. Two different environments are prepared and solved for and the result for each environment is presented. It is shown that PSO is indeed applicable for use in path planning for rough environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524583/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11446956","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5524583/","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Use of Particle Swarm Optimization in path planning for rough terrain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of Particle Swarm Optimization in path planning for rough terrain","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"34raad2010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05164S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512514","isNumber":"5524532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512514","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5524532","articleId":"5524583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":5524603,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Brain-inspired paradigms such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer the potential of elegant, low-power and robust methods of performing computing. Previous work by the authors reports a reconfigurable mixed signal Network on Chip (NoC)-based SNN architecture, with reconfigurable analogue neuron cell and digital NoC The SNN architecture includes an array of neural tiles, each incorporating a NoC router for packet-based neuron interconnect. This paper presents a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based evolution framework which interacts with the SNN architecture to evolve SNN-based solutions to problems. Simulation results are presented which verify the adaptability of the reconfigurable NoC-based SNN architecture in evolving a solution for the XOR benchmark problem. Results on the synthesised neural tile area utilisation for FPGAs are also presented. This work contributes to the realisation of a large scale reconfigurable mixed signal hardware platform for SNNs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evolvable NoC-based spiking neural network architecture","doi":"10.1049/cp.2009.1732","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"IET Irish Signals and Systems Conference (ISSC 2009)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510084/5524662/05524665.pdf","publicationTitle":"IET Irish Signals and Systems Conference (ISSC 2009)","startPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2009.1732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5524662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5524665","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","field programmable gate arrays","genetic algorithms","network-on-chip","neural net architecture","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolvable NoC based spiking neural network architecture","fault tolerance","brain inspired paradigms","analogue neuron cell","digital NoC","neural tiles","NoC router","packet based neuron interconnect","genetic algorithm based evolution framework","XOR benchmark problem","FPGAs","large scale reconfigurable mixed signal hardware platform","Network on Chip based SNN architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable Spiking Neural Networks","Network on Chip","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"An evolvable NoC-based spiking neural network architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"10-11 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11260197","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evolvable NoC-based spiking neural network architecture","confLoc":"Dublin","sourcePdf":"20091732.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03274S","chronDate":"10-11 June 2009","isNumber":"5524662","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510084","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5524665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5524690,"authors":[{"name":"Kritchai Witheephanich","affiliation":["Wireless Access Research Centre, Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Limerick, Ireland"],"firstName":"Kritchai","lastName":"Witheephanich"},{"name":"Martin J.

The key performance requirement is to maximise battery lifetime while also preserving sufficient Quality of Service (QoS) among all users. This is achieved by implementing a closed-loop MPC mechanism within a nominal state-space tracking error based dynamic model that uses the received signal strength related to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as a state feedback signal. The resulting controller is compared with a number of proven strategies and is experimentally validated using an IEEE 802.15.4 WSN test bed and across a number of different test scenarios.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2009.1709","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"IET Irish Signals and Systems Conference (ISSC 2009)","displayPublicationTitle":"IET Irish Signals and Systems Conference (ISSC 2009)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510084/5524662/05524690.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2009.1709","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5524662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the applicability of model predictive power control to an IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the applicability of model predictive power control to an IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor network","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11260175","conferenceDate":"10-11 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the applicability of model predictive power control to an IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor network","confLoc":"Dublin","sourcePdf":"20091709.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048537S","chronDate":"10-11 June 2009","isNumber":"5524662","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510084","citationCount":"5","articleId":"5524690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5524739,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofei Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406554100"},{"name":"Bing-Zhong Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Bing-Zhong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280506100"},{"name":"Gang Zeng","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37535133200"},{"name":"Guangding Ge","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Guangding","lastName":"Ge","id":"37531594500"},{"name":"Shuai Ding","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Ding","id":"37531798200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5708-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5705-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5706-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5524739","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"abstract":"This paper presents a novel scheme of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission link combined with the time reversal technique, which is recently believed as a promising self-adaptive technique to enhance the wireless transmission due to the special characteristics: spatial focusing and temporal focusing.

Typically, the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique is well suited for modeling fields in heterogeneous media; the method of moments (MoM) is well suited for modeling complex antennas in free space. This paper introduces a hybrid technique, based upon the equivalence principle, and decomposes the problem of antennas located on ground into two coupled equivalent problems: one for the antenna geometry and the other for the ground geometry, with field information passing between them via a rapidly converging iterative procedure. The fields in each region may be modeled using numerical techniques best suited to them. Results for several test cases are presented, using FDTD to model the environment problem and MoM for the antenna problem, which demonstrates the accuracy of this hybrid technique.","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5524788","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5492939/5524731/05524788.pdf","startPage":"1344","endPage":"1347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5524788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5524731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An MoM/FDTD hybrid technique for modeling HF antennas located on ground","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5524788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524788/","displayDocTitle":"An MoM/FDTD hybrid technique for modeling HF antennas located on ground","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11472642","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5524788/","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An MoM/FDTD hybrid technique for modeling HF antennas located on ground","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"D207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087461S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5492939","isNumber":"5524731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5492939","xplore-issue":"5524731","articleId":"5524788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5524797,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in improving convergence behavior and bit error rate performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5524854","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5492939/5524731/05524854.pdf","startPage":"1801","endPage":"1804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5524854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5524731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A variable step size blind equalization algorithm for QAM signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5524854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524854/","displayDocTitle":"A variable step size blind equalization algorithm for QAM signals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11472823","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5524854/","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A variable step size blind equalization algorithm for QAM signals","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"E303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062532S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5492939","isNumber":"5524731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5492939","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5524731","articleId":"5524854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5524855,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37540135500"},{"name":"Yang Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37536130300"},{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"38151885100"},{"name":"Jiawen Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiawen","lastName":"Sun","id":"37540175300"},{"name":"Wenhua Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenhua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37279187600"},{"name":"Yufei Shen","affiliation":["China Academy of Space Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yufei","lastName":"Shen","id":"37533557000"},{"name":"Zhenghe Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenghe","lastName":"Feng","id":"37278814400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5708-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5705-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5706-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5524855","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband antennas","Antenna measurements","MIMO","Polarization","Antennas and propagation","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Indoor environments","Radio transmitters","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadband antennas","indoor radio","MIMO communication","polarisation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiowave propagation","UHF antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband indoor MIMO channel","dual polarization antennas","broadband MIMO channel","multiple input multiple output channel","M transmitters","N receivers","radio propagation channel","none line-of-sight","obstructed line-of-sight","frequency 2.3 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO channel measurement","Channel capacity","channel characterization"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a newly-built broadband multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) channel characterization platform in indoor environment.

Since this method is a data intensive and computation intensive problem, there are a lot of initiatives to improve the scalability and the performance of the FDTD. Specifically the use of GPU to accelerate the FDTD is in focus, which has a good cost-benefit, offering a speedup of hundreds of times if compared to the traditional CPU computation. Nevertheless, the current implementations of FDTD in GPU need GPU devices with memory capacity to allocate the roll data needed for the simulation, which in many cases could require additional investments to increase the domain of the simulation. This work proposes a solution of FDTD over GPU that uses overlapping subgrids to increase the domain of the FDTD simulation through the use of CPU memory. The redundancy of the overlapping subgrids is used to minimize the memory traffic between GPU and CPU, increasing the performance. Tests of performance show that the solution combines the power of GPU with the memory facility of the CPU, allowing the accomplishment of simulations that require more memory than what is offered by the GPU device at a damaging performance cost lower than 10%.","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5524901","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5492939/5524731/05524901.pdf","startPage":"1536","endPage":"1539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5524901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5524731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overcoming the GPU memory limitation on FDTD through the use of overlapping subgrids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5524901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524901/","displayDocTitle":"Overcoming the GPU memory limitation on FDTD through the use of overlapping subgrids","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11472866","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5524901/","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overcoming the GPU memory limitation on FDTD through the use of overlapping subgrids","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"P417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044293S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5492939","isNumber":"5524731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5492939","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5524731","articleId":"5524901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5524902,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Bi","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Bi","id":"38184946500"},{"name":"Yongxin Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yongxin","lastName":"Guo","id":"37277882000"},{"name":"James Brinkhoff","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Brinkhoff","id":"37274773800"},{"name":"Mook-Seng Leong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Mook-Seng","lastName":"Leong","id":"37280690400"},{"name":"Fujiang Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Fujiang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37288118800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5708-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5705-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5706-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5524902","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":909},"abstract":"A novel unilateralization technique for a high frequency differential power amplifier is proposed to improve the gain and stability.

Compared with other suppression schemes, the proposed scheme has better SER performance and is less sensitive to the length of pilot symbols.","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5524964","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5492939/5524731/05524964.pdf","startPage":"1267","endPage":"1270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5524964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5524731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An iterative MLD scheme for MIMO-STBC system with directional interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5524964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524964/","displayDocTitle":"An iterative MLD scheme for MIMO-STBC system with directional interference","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11472929","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5524964/","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iterative MLD scheme for MIMO-STBC system with directional interference","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"P362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04608S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5492939","isNumber":"5524731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5492939","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5524731","articleId":"5524964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5524966,"authors":[{"name":"Shuiyang Lin","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless Sensor Network & Communication, Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shanghai, China","Shanghai Research Centre for Wireless Communications, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shuiyang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37534995500"},{"name":"Guosheng Wang","affiliation":["Shanghai Research Centre for Wireless Communications, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Guosheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37536961900"},{"name":"Kaifu Pan","affiliation":["Shanghai Research Centre for Wireless Communications, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Kaifu","lastName":"Pan","id":"37543586500"},{"name":"Xiaoguang Ge","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless Sensor Network & Communication, Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shanghai, China","Shanghai Research Centre for Wireless Communications, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoguang","lastName":"Ge","id":"37531578800"},{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless Sensor Network & Communication, Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shanghai, China","Shanghai Research Centre for Wireless Communications, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37069163300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5708-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5705-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5706-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5524966","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Microstrip antennas","Frequency","Geometry","Resonance","3G mobile communication","Wireless communication","Etching","Impedance","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","broadband antennas","code division multiple access","microstrip lines","monopole antennas","multifrequency antennas","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-frequency design","microstrip monopole antenna","WCDMA","meander microstrip line","broadband dual-frequency operation","impedance bandwidth","IMT-2000 extension band","bandwidth 1920 MHz to 1980 MHz","bandwidth 2110 MHz to 2170 MHz","frequency 2.5 GHz"]}],"abstract":"A new dual-frequency design of microstrip monopole antenna is proposed and experimentally studied.

By studying the geometrical relations between the rectangular QAM signal constellation and PAM signal constellation, a novel cost function including blind equalization and detection of them is defined. Such cost function-based the improved constant modulus algorithm (CMA) transforms the coordinates of outputs from equalizer and guide the new coordinates of them to locate on the unit circle. It will go to zero when the channel is perfectly equalized which results in faster convergence rate and lower steady state mean square error (MSE). Furthermore the more attractive performance of it is that it can achieve the detection of QAM and PAM signals without any priori statistical information of them. So the proposed method can be used in some special fields such as military field threat evaluation, electronic counter measures and many others. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves satisfactory performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5524979","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5492939/5524731/05524979.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5524979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5524731","startPage":"1248","endPage":"1251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint blind equalization and detection of QAM and PAM transmissions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5524979","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint blind equalization and detection of QAM and PAM transmissions","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5524979/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11472944","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5524979/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint blind equalization and detection of QAM and PAM transmissions","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"P357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05064S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5492939","isNumber":"5524731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5492939","xplore-issue":"5524731","articleId":"5524979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5525001,"authors":[{"name":"R Mardeni","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Jalan Multimedia, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"R","lastName":"Mardeni","id":"37078958700"},{"name":"Lee Yih Pey","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Jalan Multimedia, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Lee Yih","lastName":"Pey","id":"37530471500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5708-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5705-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5706-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5525001","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":565},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Propagation losses","Loss measurement","Base stations","Urban areas","Testing","Frequency","Electromagnetic modeling","Multimedia systems","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path loss model development","urban outdoor coverage","code division multiple access","CDMA system","Kuala Lumpur Malaysia","free space pass loss model","Okumura model","Hata model","Egli model","semiempirical model","regression fitting method","semi-empirical model","optimization process","mean relative error","Yihpey model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Path loss","Mean Relative Error","CDMA","Urban Outdoor Coverage"]}],"abstract":"The study of this work is to develop a new path loss model for urban outdoor coverage in CDMA system based on the empirical measurements collected in CDMA network in Kuala Lumpur (KL), Malaysia.

The Okumura's Model was chosen as reference in new path loss model development based on the smallest mean relative error to the measured path loss with up to 10.46%. A semi-empirical model is developed from Okumura and the collected measurements by regression fitting method. This semi-empirical model will be used as reference in the optimization process where Okumura's model will be optimized to achieve smallest mean relative error to the semi-empirical model.

The double-negative (DNG) mediums are characterized by simultaneous negative permittivity and permeability. In order to make the FDTD method analyze the electromagnetic scattering and propagation for double-negative (DNG) medium, z-transform is applied to the FDTD method in the double-negative (DNG) medium. For the simulations, extremely large computer memory space and a long computational time is required. A parallel algorithm for the FDTD method on the state of the art graphics hardware is presented. The parallel computing techniques can be used to reduce the computation time significantly and have been widely applied in various complex FDTD applications. In this paper, we simulate the interaction between electromagnetic wave and DNG medium, and describe an impact of new GPU features on development process of an efficient Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5492939/5524731/05525091.pdf","startPage":"839","endPage":"841","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5525091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5525091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5524731","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5525091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-based accelerated FDTD simulations for double negative (DNG) materials applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetic scattering","Computational modeling","Permittivity","Permeability","Electromagnetic analysis","Electromagnetic propagation","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave propagation","electromagnetic wave scattering","finite difference time-domain analysis","magnetic permeability","metamaterials","parallel algorithms","Z transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU","double negative materials applications","accelerated FDTD simulation","DNG metamaterials","negative permittivity","negative permeability","electromagnetic scattering","electromagnetic propagation","z-transform","electromagnetic wave","finite difference time domain","parallel computing techniques","art graphics hardware","parallel algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5525091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"GPU-based accelerated FDTD simulations for double negative (DNG) materials applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5525091/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11473052","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-based accelerated FDTD simulations for double negative (DNG) materials applications","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"P260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052351S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5492939","isNumber":"5524731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5492939","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5524731","articleId":"5525091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5525092,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Hui","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Hui","id":"38276875700"},{"name":"Huang Zhi-xiang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Huang","lastName":"Zhi-xiang","id":"38274523400"},{"name":"Wu Xian-liang","affiliation":["Department of Physics Electronic Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China","Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Xian-liang","id":"38274052800"},{"name":"Liu Xiao-yong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Xiao-yong","id":"38274162400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5708-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5705-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5706-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5525092","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"abstract":"The paper presents a new efficient method of introduction of plane wave source into finite difference time domain (FDTD) grids: the method of splitting the plane-wave FDTD (SP-FDTD). The new equations for the 1-D propagator are based on spitted-field Maxwell's equations, and the propagator makes the 1-D and 2-D dispersion equations identical. The technique virtually eliminates numerical dispersion, filed location and polarization mismatches between propagator and main grid, for a plane wave propagating at an angle forming an integer grid cell ratio, which can represent almost any angle in theory. Through the leak test of the different incident angles of the Gauss pulse plane wave source in 2-D, it shows that, the technique can achieve a perfect total-field scattered-field separation, making leakage down to -340 dB levels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5492939/5524731/05525092.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"844","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5525092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5525092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5524731","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5525092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient splitting the plane-wave FDTD method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Electromagnetic scattering","Radar scattering","Maxwell equations","Time domain analysis","Dispersion","Frequency domain analysis","Signal processing","Physics education","Polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave polarisation","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient splitting","plane-wave FDTD method","finite difference time domain grids","FDTD","1-D propagator","spitted-field Maxwell's equations","numerical dispersion","polarization","dispersion equations","Gauss pulse plane wave","total-field scattered-field separation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite difference time domain","total-field scattered-field separation","the method of splitting the plane-wave FDTD (SP-FDTD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5525092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"An efficient splitting the plane-wave FDTD method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5525092/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11473053","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient splitting the plane-wave FDTD method","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"P261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051324S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5492939","isNumber":"5524731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5492939","xplore-issue":"5524731","articleId":"5525092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5525094,"authors":[{"name":"Ben Sun","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Sun","id":"37531281200"},{"name":"Lanlan Ping","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lanlan","lastName":"Ping","id":"37537129300"},{"name":"Xiaoxiang He","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxiang","lastName":"He","id":"37293267300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5708-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5705-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5706-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5525094","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Time domain analysis","Finite element methods","Electromagnetic analysis","Electromagnetic scattering","Concurrent computing","Application software","Differential equations","Sun","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","electromagnetic wave scattering","finite element analysis","radar cross-sections","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time domain finite element method","electromagnetic analysis","OpenMP","2D electromagnetic scattering analysis","matrix vector multiplication","conjugate gradient solver","TDFEM algorithm","bistatic radar cross section","RCS"]}],"abstract":"Paralleled Time-Domain Finite-Element Method (TDFEM) is developed based on OpenMP for 2-D electromagnetic scattering analysis in this paper.

Numerical results suggest that the SRKN FDTD algorithm acquires better stability and accuracy compared with the conventional high order FDTD schemes and Symplectic Runge-Kutta FDTD.","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5525152","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5492939/5524731/05525152.pdf","startPage":"925","endPage":"928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5525152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5524731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel high-order finite-difference time-domain method based on symplectic Runge-Kutta-Nystrom method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5525152","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5525152/","displayDocTitle":"A novel high-order finite-difference time-domain method based on symplectic Runge-Kutta-Nystrom method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11473111","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5525152/","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel high-order finite-difference time-domain method based on symplectic Runge-Kutta-Nystrom method","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"C210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05413S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5492939","isNumber":"5524731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5492939","xplore-issue":"5524731","articleId":"5525152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5525161,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Yao","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Yao","id":"37534156300"},{"name":"Jianfeng Zheng","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianfeng","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085353586"},{"name":"Zhenghe Feng","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenghe","lastName":"Feng","id":"37278814400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5708-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5705-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5706-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5525161","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linearity","Quantization","Signal generators","Chirp modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Degradation","Bandwidth","Frequency synthesizers","Frequency modulation","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chirp modulation","direct digital synthesis","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linearity analysis","direct digital chirp synthesizer","amplitude quantization","simple algorithm","chirp signal","signal to quantization noise ratio","nonuniform quantizer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5525161","abstract":"A simple algorithm is developed for calculating the linearity of the chirp signal generated by a direct digital chirp synthesizer in the presence of amplitude quantization.

The unbalanced filter is formed by connecting the FBAR resonators in a ladder topology, and low insertion loss, sharp transition from pass band to near stop band, high out-of-band attenuations are achieved. The filter die features a small size of 0.7 mm \u00d7 0.5 mm. The balanced filter involves a balun which performs the single ended to differential conversion.

A conclusion is drawn that an optimum noise figure can be achieved by proper choice of biased current and transistor geometry with longer emitter length and more base stripe number.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5524731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5525235","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5492939/5524731/05525235.pdf","startPage":"492","endPage":"495","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5525235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of bias current and geometry on noise performance of SiGe HBT low noise amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Impact of bias current and geometry on noise performance of SiGe HBT low noise amplifier","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5525235/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11472706","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5525235/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of bias current and geometry on noise performance of SiGe HBT low noise amplifier","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"B204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041027S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5492939","isNumber":"5524731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5492939","xplore-issue":"5524731","articleId":"5525235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5525237,"authors":[{"name":"Zhebin Wang","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec \u00e0 Rimouski, Rimouski, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhebin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37537366400"},{"name":"Shengjie Gao","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec \u00e0 Rimouski, Rimouski, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Shengjie","lastName":"Gao","id":"37536096800"},{"name":"Chan-Wang Park","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec \u00e0 Rimouski, Rimouski, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Chan-Wang","lastName":"Park","id":"37277791100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5708-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5705-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5706-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5525237","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":910},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5525237","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance matching","Power amplifiers","Power generation","Circuit simulation","Predictive models","Tunable circuits and devices","Tuners","Error correction","Shunt (electrical)","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impedance matching","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tunable load impedance matching network","power amplifier","variable load impedance","load pull tuner","parasitic effect","active devices","lumped components","class-AB amplifier","shunt variable capacitor","inductor","power added efficiency"]}],"abstract":"In this article, we proposed one simple method which achieves variable load impedance. By this method, without utilizing load pull tuner, the errors caused by various reasons, such as parasitic effect at the lumped components and active devices, can be corrected. We designed and fabricated one Class-AB amplifier to demonstrate our simple method by adjusting a shunt variable capacitor and inductor added at the input and output of the load matching network respectively. Before correcting the circuit, comparing the measured maximum PAE (Power Added efficiency) of the power amplifier (40.21% at 37.70 dBm output power) with the simulated PAE (52.96% at 40.35 dBm output power), the performance of this amplifier was not as what simulation predicted. After optimizing the circuit with our method, we obtained the maximum PAE reached 50.63% and the maximum output power increased to 40.10 dBm which more agree with the simulated result than the result before the correction.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5524731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5525237","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5492939/5524731/05525237.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"487","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2010.5525237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple method for tunable load impedance matching network of power amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"A simple method for tunable load impedance matching network of power amplifier","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5525237/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11472708","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5525237/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple method for tunable load impedance matching network of power amplifier","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"B202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038467S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5492939","isNumber":"5524731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5492939","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5524731","articleId":"5525237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5525244,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Chang-wei","affiliation":["Institute of Astronautics and aeronautics Science and Technology, UESTC, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Chang-wei","id":"38275629000"},{"name":"Qin Kai-yu","affiliation":["Institute of Astronautics and aeronautics Science and Technology, UESTC, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Kai-yu","id":"38271516300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5708-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5705-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5706-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5525244","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":356},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5525244","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Linearity","High power amplifiers","Frequency","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Power generation","Power harmonic filters","Mobile communication","Wireless communication","Power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["defected ground structures","intermodulation","power amplifiers","transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["defected ground structure","Doherty power amplifier","wireless communication","transmission line","freescale MRF6S21050","digital baseband predistortion technique","third-order intermodulation","power 50 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doherty","defected ground","power amplifier","third-order inter-modulation (IM)"]}],"abstract":"The improvement of linearity and efficiency of power amplifier becomes the research focus in the wireless communication.

The National Aviation Safety Strategic Plan (NASSP), developed by the Safety Working Group of the JPDO, focuses on establishing the goals, objectives, and strategies needed to realize the safety objectives of the NextGen Integrated Plan. The three goals of the NASSP are Safer Practices, Safer Systems, and Safer Worldwide. Safer Practices emphasizes an integrated systematic approach to safety risk management through implementation of formalized Safety Management Systems (SMS) that incorporate safety data analysis processes, and the enhancement of methods for ensuring safety an inherent characteristic of NextGen. Safer Systems emphasizes implementation of safety-enhancing technologies, which will improve safety for human-centered interfaces and enhance the safety of airborne and ground-based systems. Safer Worldwide encourages coordinating the adoption of the safer practices and safer systems technologies, policies, and procedures worldwide, such that the maximum level of safety is achieved across air transportation system boundaries. This introduces the NASSP and its development, and focuses on the Safer Systems elements of the NASSP, which incorporates three objectives for NextGen systems: 1) provide risk reducing system interfaces; 2) provide safety enhancements for airborne systems; and 3) provide safety enhancements for ground-based systems. Our goal is to expose avionics and air traffic management system developers to NASSP objectives and Safer Systems strategies.","doi":"10.1109/MAES.2010.5525314","startPage":"9","endPage":"14","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/62/5525307/05525314.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAES.2010.5525314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5525307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Safer systems: A NextGen Aviation Safety Strategic goal","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Air safety","Air transportation","Risk management","Data analysis","Aerospace electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace safety","air traffic control","avionics","ground support systems","safety systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["safer system","nextgen aviation safety strategic goal","next generation air transportation system","national aviation safety strategic plan","safety management system","safety data analysis","human-centered interface","airborne system","ground-based system","air traffic management system","avionics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5525314/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Safer systems: A NextGen Aviation Safety Strategic goal","volume":"25","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11447005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Safer systems: A NextGen Aviation Safety Strategic goal","sourcePdf":"0007.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144644S","chronDate":"June  2010","isNumber":"5525307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"62","citationCount":"15","articleId":"5525314","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5525426,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It offers accurate, high-speed computation of the far-field patterns of planar phased antennas, including advanced far-field analysis capabilities and comprehensive two-dimensional and three-dimensional visualization of the simulated results. The program was written in MATLAB. Execution time is minimized by coding the program as matrix operations and using two-dimensional FFT (fast Fourier transform) techniques for calculating the far-field patterns. A unique feature is the possibility of synthesizing user-defined low-sidelobe tapers for both sum and difference patterns. APAS can handle aperture configurations with the array elements sited along rectangular or triangular lattices. The aperture may consist of subarrays. The program allows the calculation of the noise figure and the third-order-intercept point of both the array and the applied transmitting/receiving module. For tracking antennas with monopulse capability, there is the ability to determine the tracking slope for both the azimuth and elevation plane. The paper addresses an assessment of the program, details how the computations are carried out, and presents numerous simulations to demonstrate the main capabilities of APAS.

This facility, based on the use of time-reversal techniques in a reverberating environment, is shown here to also be a useful tool for the characterization of the field radiated by an antenna under test (AUT). The time-reversal electromagnetic chamber has proven to be capable of providing real-time measurements, with accuracy typically better than 1 dB over the main Iobes, while using a limited number of static probe antennas. This performance is made possible by taking advantage of the reflections over the chamber's walls in order to gain access to the field radiated along all directions, with no need to mechanically displace the probes, or to have a full range of electronically switched probes. A two-dimensional numerical validation supported this approach, proving that the proposed procedure allows the retrieval of the free-space radiation pattern of the AUT.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/5525550/05525625.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2010.5525625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2010.5525625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5525550","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5525625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Radiation-Pattern Measurements in a Time-Reversal Electromagnetic Chamber","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic radiation","Electromagnetic measurements","Probes","Electromagnetic scattering","Reverberation chamber","Testing","Antenna measurements","Electromagnetic reflection","Performance gain","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","antenna testing","reverberation chambers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-reversal electromagnetic chamber","coherent wavefronts","reverberation chamber","antenna under test","accurate radiation pattern measurements","real-time measurements","static probe antennas","chamber wall reflections","two-dimensional numerical validation","free-space radiation pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna radiation patterns","antenna measurements","time reversal","reverberation chamber","real time measurement","time domain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5525625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Radiation-Pattern Measurements in a Time-Reversal Electromagnetic Chamber","volume":"52","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5525625/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11447052","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Radiation-Pattern Measurements in a Time-Reversal Electromagnetic Chamber","sourcePdf":"0075.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.336736S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"5525550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5525550","articleId":"5525625","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5525665,"authors":[{"name":"Hongwei Jia","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Hongwei","lastName":"Jia","id":"37530976900"},{"name":"Osama Abdel-Rahman","affiliation":["APECOR Corporation, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Osama","lastName":"Abdel-Rahman","id":"38273701700"},{"name":"Karthik Padmanabhan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Padmanabhan","id":"37547166300"},{"name":"Patrick Shea","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Shea","id":"37089048413"},{"name":"Issa Batarseh","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Issa","lastName":"Batarseh","id":"37274458200"},{"name":"Z.

Conventional synchronous flyback topologies using discrete synchronous rectifier face challenges in precise timing control on the secondary side. In this paper, MHz-frequency operation of a flyback DC-DC converter using a new monolithic self-synchronized rectifier (SSR) is investigated and demonstrated. The SSR IC, acting solely on its own drain-source voltage instead of external control signals, considerably simplifies converter design, improves system efficiency, and enables MHz operating frequency. Analysis, modeling, and experimental results are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5525665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 June 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5525665/","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11455234","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"MHz-frequency operation of flyback converter with monolithic self-synchronized rectifier (SSR)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MHz-frequency operation of flyback converter with monolithic self-synchronized rectifier (SSR)","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"INTELEC2010000237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051915S","chronDate":"6-10 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507768","isNumber":"5525641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507768","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5525641","articleId":"5525665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5525673,"authors":[{"name":"Richard Mehl","affiliation":["E-T-A GmbH, Altdorf, Germany"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Mehl","id":"37295312400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3383-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3384-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-0473"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5210"}],"articleNumber":"5525673","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","Telecommunications","Power distribution","Solid state circuits","Circuit breakers","Electronic circuits","Power system protection","Contacts","Voltage","Switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power distribution protection","power supply quality","vacuum circuit breakers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system architecture","smart telecom power distribution systems","solid state hybrid circuit breakers","retrofit capability","maintenance cost","servicing cost","power distribution rail","hydraulic-magnetic circuit breaker","mechanical circuit breakers","electric AC circuits","electric DC circuits","electrical isolation criterion","solid state remote controls circuit breakers","SSRCCB","power loss","programmable rated current","programmable trip time curve","wire break indication","leakage current","induced voltage spikes","electromagnetic pulses","power semiconductor","vacuum filled switching chambers","gas filled switching chambers","solid-state electronic circuit breakers","electronic interrupting devices","integrated current limitation","integrated remote monitoring","power management","voltage 48 V","voltage -72 V","voltage -400 V"]}],"abstract":"Today it has become a general requirement to start up complex machinery and equipment quickly and easily despite conceptions growing ever more complex and to re-configure systems already in use without downtimes. Ease of connection is requested even in locations difficult to access, providing easy retrofit capability and reducing maintenance and servicing costs. The power distribution rail features a modular design, i.e. it carries only those components necessary for the present application. The system is based on a hydraulic-magnetic circuit breaker. Protection of loads with higher ratings is possible through parallel connection. Therefore there are almost freely selectable protection ratings available. Conventional mechanical circuit breakers protect electric AC and DC circuits from overload and short circuit and also meet the required electrical isolation criterion after contact separation. They are limited in life because of mechanical abrasion. Existing hybrid devices like Remote Controls Circuit Breakers (RCCB) combine the advantages of mechanical circuit breakers like lower contact resistance and lower power loss with some of electronic circuit breakers like remote control. But electronic circuit breakers offer more features like nearly unlimited short circuit capacity by current limitation, programmable rated current, programmable trip time curve, wire break indication and millions of operations without any abrasion. They do not provide electrical isolation in (air gap) due to the leakage current at OFF-state and they show susceptibility to line induced voltage spikes. Protection against field induced electromagnetic pulses needs additional shielding. Therefore electronic circuit breakers often use an electrical contact in series to the power semiconductor, which will stay open in the OFF-state such withstanding the required isolation voltages. For high DC voltage applications conventional circuit breakers need big air gaps, sophisticated arc extinguishing means or they use expensive technologies like vacuum or gas filled switching chambers. Solid State Remote Controlled Circuit Breakers (SSRCCB) can meet the requirements in size and performance, but they also need an electrical contact for isolation. While the speed of operation of conventional circuit breakers for equipment (CBE) is suitable for the majority of modern day equipment applications, ultra-sensitive solid-state circuitry of the nature typically found in telecom power distribution applications will often require faster switching protection under overcurrent conditions than electromechanical CBEs can achieve. Faced with this background this paper presents the case for solid-state electronic circuit breakers for smart telecom power distribution systems based on the concept of electronic interrupting devices. The functionality of electronic interrupting devices and their integrated serial communication bus link (enabling individual programming of the desired tripping thresholds for input under/over-voltage protection and output overload) is explained by examining integrated current limitation and protection characteristics for short circuit and overload sensing and in-built current flow interruption. The paper further illustrates the suitability of electronic interrupting devices for 48VDC, -72VDC, as well as -400VDC telecom power applications whereby particular emphasis is placed on an integrated remote monitoring capability via a serial bus. Power management aspects are also highlighted on the basis of a priority load shedding capability thereby ensuring battery buffer capacity is not wasted. This all leads into a matured and sophisticated power and facility management. Conventional electromechanical circuit breakers not only protect AC and DC circuitry from overload and short circuit conditions, but in parallel importantly additionally ensure that the required physical isolation criteria after contact separation are maintained. CBE manufacturers it is demonstrated therefore, need to be mindful, to incorporate such benefits of traditional electromechanical designs along with the enhanced solid state electronic switching (1) ESS Electronic Circuit Breaker requirements when considering their design options. For this reason, electronic circuit breakers are typically hybrid designs featuring an electrical contact in series with the semiconductor circuitry which remains open in the semiconductor \"OFF\" state thereby ensuring the required isolation voltages can be withstood.","publicationTitle":"Intelec 2010","displayPublicationTitle":"Intelec 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507768/5525641/05525673.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Requirements of the power system architecture for using the next generation of smart telecom power distribution systems in combination with solid state hypride circuit breakers","doi":"10.1109/INTLEC.2010.5525673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5525641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTLEC.2010.5525673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5525673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5525673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Requirements of the power system architecture for using the next generation of smart telecom power distribution systems in combination with solid state hypride circuit breakers","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11455242","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5525673/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Requirements of the power system architecture for using the next generation of smart telecom power distribution systems in combination with solid state hypride circuit breakers","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"INTELEC2010000215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048013S","chronDate":"6-10 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507768","isNumber":"5525641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507768","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5525641","articleId":"5525673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5525678,"authors":[{"name":"Alexis Kwasinski","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Alexis","lastName":"Kwasinski","id":"37280511700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3383-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3384-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-0473"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5210"}],"articleNumber":"5525678","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5525678","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart grids","Power supplies","Power system reliability","Availability","Costs","Stress","Communications technology","Power systems","Power generation","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","energy storage","smart power grids","telecommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart-grids development","communication systems","disasters","communication facilities"]}],"abstract":"This paper discusses the significance of smart grid implementation for communication systems.

From a charging control standpoint the basic needs are a means for limiting recharge current and a means for avoiding damaging or unsafe high voltages. Furthermore, these functions must be built into the battery along with adequate controls to provide for fail-safe operation. Saft's experience has been that these charging needs can be met without problem in systems with standard telecom rectifier configurations. Inevitably, however, there are attempts to 'push the envelope,' taking Li-ion batteries designed for those standard systems and applying them with other charging sources and in other system configurations that do not conform to the norm. In some of these cases we have encountered incompatibilities and have had to work with the system integrator and/or adapt our control strategies accordingly. Examples include: systems with rectifiers in which software-controlled current limiting was implemented; ac power systems in which there was a high level of dc ripple; systems in which the charging source requires a minimum dc bus voltage in order to be energized; and deep-cycling systems requiring additional coordination of parallel string operation. This paper discusses some basic methods of Li-ion charging control and describes the lessons learned by Saft in nonstandard rectifier configurations. Typical communication, alarm management and control strategies are also discussed, including specific characteristics of Saft's latest Li-ion telecom products. Saft's position is that operators will not be properly served by these products unless communications and control are standardized in the industry and adopted by all rectifier and Liion battery manufacturers. Possible avenues for achieving this standardization are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5525704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 June 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5525704/","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11455273","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Lessons learned in the coordination of lithium-ion battery charging and control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lessons learned in the coordination of lithium-ion battery charging and control","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"INTELEC2010000091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035895S","chronDate":"6-10 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507768","isNumber":"5525641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507768","xplore-issue":"5525641","articleId":"5525704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5525758,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Samimi","affiliation":["Communications Technology Department, Iran Telecom Research Center, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Samimi","id":"37284241100"},{"name":"Paeiz Azmi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Department, Tarbiat Moalem University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Paeiz","lastName":"Azmi","id":"37284997500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0639"}],"articleNumber":"5525758","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":695},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5525758","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intensity modulation","Optical modulation","Optical fiber communication","Bit error rate","Diversity reception","Performance analysis","Closed-form solution","Atmospheric modeling","Binary phase shift keying","Phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","optical communication","optical modulation","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subcarrier intensity modulated free-space optical communications","K-distributed turbulence channels","bit error rate","BER","binary phase shift keying","BPSK","negative exponential turbulence model","probability density function","weighted negative exponential","selection combining","spatial diversity","channel irradiance","diversity order"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Atmospheric turbulence","Free-space optics","K distribution","Subcarrier modulation"]}],"doi":"10.1364/JOCN.2.000625","publicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563700/5571996/05525758.pdf","startPage":"625","endPage":"632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.2.000625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier Intensity Modulated Free-Space Optical Communications in K-Distributed Turbulence Channels","abstract":"In this paper, the bit error rate (BER) performance of a subcarrier intensity-modulated (SIM) free-space optical (FSO) communications system using binary phase shift keying (BPSK) is investigated over a K-distributed turbulence channel. First, the performance is analyzed employing a negative exponential turbulence model, and an exact closed-form expression is derived for the BER. Then, it is shown that the probability density function (PDF) of the K distribution can be approximated accurately by a finite sum of weighted negative exponential PDFs. Based on this interesting result and by using the closed-form expression, which is derived for the case of a negative exponential model, an approximate, closed-form expression for the BER of the BPSK-based SIM FSO over a K channel is derived. Moreover, to improve the BER performance, spatial diversity using selection combining (SC) is considered. It is shown that the PDF of the resulting channel irradiance corresponding to the SC diversity scheme over a K channel can be approximated accurately by a finite linear combination of negative exponential functions. The derived approximate PDF accurately estimates the PDF of the channel irradiance for arbitrary values of diversity order and is valid for a wide range of channel parameters. Then, an approximate, closed-form expression is derived for the average BER of the BPSK-based SIM FSO system employing the SC diversity technique over a K channel. Numerical results presented in this paper show that the derived approximate expressions are very accurate and can be used as efficient tools for performance analysis of the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5525758/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","publicationDate":"August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5525758/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11674407","volume":"2","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier Intensity Modulated Free-Space Optical Communications in K-Distributed Turbulence Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcarrier Intensity Modulated Free-Space Optical Communications in K-Distributed Turbulence Channels","sourcePdf":"625.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094391S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"5571996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5571996","articleId":"5525758","onlineDate":"26 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5525834,"authors":[{"name":"K.

They provide a format for the parameters which must be obtained. The loading and terminal conditions can then be specified and the model state equations used to obtain the thermal limit curves and, what is more important, the time solution for current, torque, speed, and the temperatures of the rotor and stator. Adequate protection of induction motors is routinely achieved via locked-rotor, phase unbalance, and overload protection. However, conditions of changing load torque, frequent starts, temporary phase unbalance and high inertia loading must often be tolerated. Designing protective schemes for these conditions using conventional relays is difficult and sometimes impossible. Motor protection is primarily a temperature estimation problem. Recognizing that good electrical and thermal models exist leads to their adoption for motor protection so that the heating and cooling process is well represented for virtually all loading and terminal conditions. This paper first reviews electrical, thermal, and mechanical models. Their parameters are discussed and a novel technique is introduced for accommodating the frequency dependent skin effect of the rotor resistance using a simple speed estimation algorithm. The correlation with protection practice is established by using the models to obtain the thermal limit curves for a motor including the relatively recent rotor accelerating time limit. The models are then used to analyze conditions of locked rotor, high inertia starting and overload torque.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5525836","publicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Review","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Review","pdfPath":"/iel5/39/5525836/05525892.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MPER.1984.5525892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MPER.1984.5525892","startPage":"48","endPage":"48","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal Protection of Induction Motors Enhanced by Interactive Electrical and Thermal Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5525892/","displayDocTitle":"Thermal Protection of Induction Motors Enhanced by Interactive Electrical and Thermal Models","isJournal":true,"volume":"PER-4","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","publicationDate":"July 1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal Protection of Induction Motors Enhanced by Interactive Electrical and Thermal Models","sourcePdf":"PER-vPER-4-n7-56.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032503S","chronDate":"July  1984","isNumber":"5525836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"39","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5525892","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5525902,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This paper describes the synchronizing process and the characteristics of PM motors that lead to an inherently higher starting capability than that of comparable reluctance motors. The starting performance is described with the aid of computed transient torque/speed and related trajectories. The results have been verified with reference to detailed tests on a 25-hp motor that has been described in earlier papers. Two basic configurations of PM motor are shown in Fig. 1. On the left is a four-pole arrangement with radially magnetized magnets, and on the right a six-pole arrangement with circumferentially magnetized magnets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5525902/","volume":"PER-4","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1984","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization of Line-Start Permanent-Magnet AC Motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization of Line-Start Permanent-Magnet AC Motors","sourcePdf":"PER-vPER-4-n7-66.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032639S","chronDate":"July  1984","isNumber":"5525836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"39","citationCount":"10","articleId":"5525902","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5525952,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The solution algorithm is based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method in which the load shedding would be considered as the penalty in the optimization cost function. The aim function would be optimized for minimum power loss under normal operating conditions and minimum load shedding during emergency conditions. In contrary to the other load shedding strategies, there is no limitation in where the load could be shedding and how much could be shedding. Furthermore, this algorithm has the advantages of PSO method. That is this algorithm doesn't require the gradient information, and has better global search ability.

Three objective functions (minimization of the installation cost of SVC or TCSC, minimization of the energy loss cost, and minimization of the total cost defined as the sum of the installation cost and energy loss cost) are considered for comparison purpose. All the objective functions are subject to power flow equations, bus voltage limits, reactive power output of generators at voltage controlled buses, and limits of setting values for SVC and TCSC. An optimization technique based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed to determine the optimal locations of SVC and TCSC and their corresponding setting values. A case study with a modified IEEE 14-bus system is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. It is found that the obtained optimal solutions meet the requirement of the objective functions while satisfying all the constraints. Numerical results for total real and reactive power losses, energy loss cost, installation cost, and total cost are also discussed.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2009.1792","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Conference on Advances in Power System Control, Operation and Management (APSCOM 2009)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510085/5526322/05526340.pdf","publicationTitle":"8th International Conference on Advances in Power System Control, Operation and Management (APSCOM 2009)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2009.1792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5526322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal reactive power planning with facts devices by particle swarm technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5526340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal reactive power planning with facts devices by particle swarm technique","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"8-11 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal reactive power planning with facts devices by particle swarm technique","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"20091792.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046115S","chronDate":"8-11 Nov. 2009","isNumber":"5526322","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510085","citationCount":"9","articleId":"5526340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5526382,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The principle advantage of the method presented in this paper is that off-line compuations are used. This permits the application of the supplementary control of a ``multimachine'' power system. The designation ``multimachine'' is used in this context to denote systems of up to three machines; for practical systems containing more than three machines, appropriate model order reduction is suggested. Supplementary controls differ from primary controls in that they are only used during disturbances rather than continuously. Attention is focused on the insertion of braking resistors and a specially designed dynamic programming algorithm is described for optimal resistor switching. The switching strategy is computed off-line so that the online computational requirements are minimal. The contribution of this paper is in the area of multimachine control and, in particular, a power system emergency state control. Topics concerning control models, optimization criteria and characteristics of discrete supplementary controls have been addressed. Control strategies are evaluated through digital and analog simulation involving a ten machine test system. A systematic approach to the optimization of multi-stage decision processes, called dynamic programming, was introduced by Bellman in the 1950' s [1-2]. Dynamic programming principles provide a perspective for examining optimization problems which lead to iterative functional equations. These equations are efficiently solved by using a digital computer and employing a dynamic programming computational procedure described by Larson [3].","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5526435/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1985","publicationDate":"Sept. 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","volume":"PER-5","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Application of Dynamic Programming in a Discrete Supplementary Control for Transient Stability Enhancement of Multimachine Power Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Application of Dynamic Programming in a Discrete Supplementary Control for Transient Stability Enhancement of Multimachine Power Systems","sourcePdf":"PER-vPER-5-n9-26.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037136S","chronDate":"Sept.  1985","isNumber":"5526409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"39","articleId":"5526435","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5526570,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The following five ``short note reports'' provide viewpoints on human factors considerations in electric utility dispatch control centers. The short notes focus on human factors from the points of view of power system operation information management, information presentation, and stress indentification and alleviation. A common denominator in the first four short note papers is stress in system operations. The fifth paper discusses what to do to overcome stressful situations in system operations. The short note reports presented here are intended to clarify the nature of operational concerns and problems.

This situation arises because the gapless surge arrester is electrically active throughout its lifetime whereas its predecessor, the silicon carbide arrester, was electrically passive since it was electrically isolated with gap structures. The prime consideration is one of reliably estimating the lifetime of a gapless ZnO surge arrester under continuous ac stress while maintaining the capability not only to limit surge voltages but also to absorb energy inputs resulting from lightning or switching surges and temporary overvoltages. In this paper we establish a procedure for estimating the lifetime of gapless ZnO surge arresters for ac application by incorporating the device characteristics into design requirements. This method is illustrated for ZnO-surge-arrester elements that exhibit a predictable linear resistive current versus time?? behavior as a function of applied voltage and temperature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5527713/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1986","publicationDate":"April 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","volume":"PER-6","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Procedure for Estimating the Lifetime of Gapless Metal Oxide Surge Arresters for AC Application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Procedure for Estimating the Lifetime of Gapless Metal Oxide Surge Arresters for AC Application","sourcePdf":"PER-vPER-6-n4-31.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04533S","chronDate":"April  1986","isNumber":"5527682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"39","articleId":"5527713","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5527788,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In a deregulated environment each Generation Company (GENCO) desires to optimize the payoffs while independent system operator (ISO) has its reliability solicitudes. Mostly, these two points of view create many contests. Therefore, the paper proposes a competitive area based on GA for maintenance scheduling. In this method, GENCOs are set their strategies to participate in Maintenance Market (MM) by considering load and fuel uncertainties besides considering the behaviours of other companies. On the other hand, ISO manages the MM based on reliability and offers incentives/ penalties for companies relying on its policy through MCS. For disclosing the accuracy and the applicability of this mentioned solution for maintenance scheduling of power generation units, IEEE reliability test system (RTS) has been studied.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5528314/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11519689","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5528314/","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new solution for maintenance scheduling in deregulated environment applying Genetic Algorithm and Monte-Carlo Simulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new solution for maintenance scheduling in deregulated environment applying Genetic Algorithm and Monte-Carlo Simulation","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"TS152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071611S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512007","isNumber":"5526245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512007","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5526245","articleId":"5528314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5528383,"authors":[{"name":"O.

However, distribution systems are stochastic in nature, which leads to inaccurate deterministic solutions. To take into account the unavoidable uncertainties that affect the problem's input data (mainly the load demands), this paper formulates a probabilistic multi-objective optimization problem. To reduce the computational efforts, a linearized form of the equality and inequality constraints of the multi-objective optimization model is used, and a proper micro-genetic algorithm (\u03bcGA)-based procedure is applied as a solution method. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 34-node unbalanced distribution system in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure in terms of the reduced computational effort and accuracy of the results.","doi":"10.1109/PMAPS.2010.5528422","startPage":"785","endPage":"790","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 11th International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512007/5526245/05528422.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 11th International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PMAPS.2010.5528422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5526245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A probabilistic approach for multiobjective optimal allocation of capacitors in distribution systems based on genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Genetic algorithms","Constraint optimization","Voltage","Costs","Stochastic systems","System testing","Power quality","Equations","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","genetic algorithms","power capacitors","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitor multiobjective optimal allocation","genetic algorithms","optimal location","shunt capacitors","unbalanced distribution systems","linearized form","microgenetic algorithm","IEEE 34-node unbalanced distribution system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Probabilistic Approach","Capacitor Allocation","Genetic Algorithms","Distribution Systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5528422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"A probabilistic approach for multiobjective optimal allocation of capacitors in distribution systems based on genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5528422/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11519669","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A probabilistic approach for multiobjective optimal allocation of capacitors in distribution systems based on genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"TS313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071304S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512007","isNumber":"5526245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512007","xplore-issue":"5526245","articleId":"5528422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5528629,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This technique works by pruning the state space in such a way that the MCS samples a state space that has a higher density of failure states than the original state space. This paper presents a new approach to limiting the state space sampled when calculating reliability indices by pruning the state space through the use of Population-based Intelligent Search (PIS). The preliminary results indicate that this technique is promising to improve the convergence performance of MCS when calculating reliability indices. This is tested using an IEEE Reliability Test System at different levels.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5526245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PMAPS.2010.5528892","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 11th International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 11th International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512007/5526245/05528892.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"324","doi":"10.1109/PMAPS.2010.5528892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of loss of load probability for power systems using intelligent search based state space pruning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of loss of load probability for power systems using intelligent search based state space pruning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5528892/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11519645","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5528892/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of loss of load probability for power systems using intelligent search based state space pruning","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"TS132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054945S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512007","isNumber":"5526245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512007","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5526245","articleId":"5528892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5528898,"authors":[{"name":"Graeme Hutchison","affiliation":["University of Newcastle, UK"],"firstName":"Graeme","lastName":"Hutchison","id":"37541563200"},{"name":"Bashar Zahawi","affiliation":["University of Newcastle, UK"],"firstName":"Bashar","lastName":"Zahawi","id":"37301156800"},{"name":"Damian Giaouris","affiliation":["University of Newcastle, UK"],"firstName":"Damian","lastName":"Giaouris","id":"37301128600"},{"name":"Keith Harmer","affiliation":["University of Newcastle, UK"],"firstName":"Keith","lastName":"Harmer","id":"37531358200"},{"name":"Bruce Stedall","affiliation":["Parsons Brinckerhoff, Newcastle, UK"],"firstName":"Bruce","lastName":"Stedall","id":"37389923000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5721-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5720-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5723-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5528898","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":478},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Synchronous machines","Particle swarm optimization","Power generation","Computational intelligence","Machine intelligence","Power engineering computing","Stochastic processes","Pulp manufacturing","Virtual manufacturing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric power generation","machine theory","parameter estimation","particle swarm optimisation","synchronous machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","particle swarm optimization","electrical machine","power generation","synchronous machine","parameter identification","constriction factor","intelligent computational method","stochastic search"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","Parameter Identification","Particle Swarm Optimization","PSO","Synchronous Machines"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5528898","abstract":"Synchronous machines are the most widely used electrical machine in power generation. Identifying the parameters of these machines in a non invasive way is very challenging due to the inherent nonlinearity of machine performance. This paper proposes a synchronous machine parameter identification method using particle swarm optimization (PSO) with a constriction factor. PSO is an intelligent computational method based on a stochastic search that has been shown to be a versatile and efficient tool for complicated engineering problems. A modified version of PSO allows a synchronous machine model output to be used as the objective function, thus allowing a new, more efficient method of parameter identification.

Another novel feature of this method is that while it utilizes information from failure states to estimate loss of load indices, it also uses information from acceptable states that are encountered to accelerate the convergence of the estimate. The method is demonstrated on the modified IEEE Reliability Test System.

In response, our novel FPGA-based emulation methodology models a full CMP design including applications and an OS. Activity counters programmed into the cores feed per-component microarchitectural power models. These models achieve under 10% error compared to detailed gate-level simulations. Our method retains software flexibility, but offers up to 35x speedup compared to corresponding full-system software simulations. We present our approach by emulating a 2-core Leon3 cache-coherent multiprocessor running Linux and parallel benchmarks. In an example case study, our emulated system uses activity counts (a proxy for temperature) to guide process migration between the CMP cores. Overall, this paper's methodology makes possible detailed power and thermal studies of CMPs and their operating systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-system chip multiprocessor power evaluations using FPGA-based emulation","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of the 13th international symposium on Low power electronics and design (ISLPED '08)","doi":"10.1145/1393921.1394010","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceeding of the 13th international symposium on Low power electronics and design (ISLPED '08)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5528413/5529013/05529025.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1393921.1394010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5529013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5529025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5529025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Full-system chip multiprocessor power evaluations using FPGA-based emulation","conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5529025/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"11447761","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-system chip multiprocessor power evaluations using FPGA-based emulation","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"81090335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05429S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5528413","isNumber":"5529013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5528413","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5529013","articleId":"5529025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5529031,"authors":[{"name":"Jairam S","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Jairam","lastName":"S"},{"name":"Madhusudan Rao","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, SoC Center of Excellence, India"],"firstName":"Madhusudan","lastName":"Rao","id":"37651251400"},{"name":"Jithendra Srinivas","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, SoC Center of Excellence, India"],"firstName":"Jithendra","lastName":"Srinivas","id":"37391936800"},{"name":"Parimala Vishwanath","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, SoC Center of Excellence, India"],"firstName":"Parimala","lastName":"Vishwanath","id":"37086771229"},{"name":"Udayakumar H","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Udayakumar","lastName":"H"},{"name":"Jagdish Rao","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, SoC Center of Excellence, India"],"firstName":"Jagdish","lastName":"Rao","id":"38557013400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-60558-109-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8634-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5529031","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":520},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Design optimization","Application specific integrated circuits","Character generation","Design methodology","Dynamic voltage scaling","Technological innovation","Electronic design automation and methodology","History","Logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","clocks","energy conservation","logic gates","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clock gating","power optimization","ASIC design cycle theory","power savings","dynamic power","EDA tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ASIC","RTL","SoC","low power","optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5529031","abstract":"In this tutorial we present a comprehensive analysis of the available clock gate (CG) optimization approaches with re-cent innovations available in EDA tools as they have developed in time.

Compared to a conventional DCVS design, the new design consumes 8 times less power and is 10% faster under room temperature.","doi":"10.1145/1393921.1393973","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of the 13th international symposium on Low power electronics and design (ISLPED '08)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceeding of the 13th international symposium on Low power electronics and design (ISLPED '08)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5528413/5529013/05529034.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1393921.1393973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5529013","startPage":"197","endPage":"200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single stage static level shifter design for subthreshold to I/O voltage conversion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5529034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single stage static level shifter design for subthreshold to I/O voltage conversion","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5529034/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"11447769","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5529034/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single stage static level shifter design for subthreshold to I/O voltage conversion","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"81090197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070799S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5528413","isNumber":"5529013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5528413","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5529013","articleId":"5529034","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5529042,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Jin","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Jin","id":"37579026800"},{"name":"Chi-Ying Tsui","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Chi-Ying","lastName":"Tsui","id":"37278549800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-60558-109-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8634-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5529042","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":571},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Energy consumption","Iterative decoding","Parallel architectures","Hardware","Computer architecture","Message passing","Iterative algorithms","Costs","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","decoding","error correction codes","IEEE standards","parity check codes","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power layered decoding architecture","LDPC decoder implementation","IEEE 802.11n LDPC codes","low power LDPC decoder design","memory access reduction","LDPC parity check matrix","memory storage","thresholding decoding scheme","error correcting performance","TSMC","CMOS process","power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["low power","low-density parity-check code","thresholding"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a low power LDPC decoder design based on reducing the amount of memory access.

We show that with the continued trend of raising array supply to counter process variations, it is more effective to use a per-element selectable virtual power-supply scenario as opposed to single array supply with traditional redundancy schemes. The element can be a bank, a sub-array, or an independent row/column, and the element's virtual supply value is determined based on fail bitmaps. The technique can also be used in conjunction with traditional redundancy schemes to further improve the efficiency. The supply and redundancy assignments can be obtained by relying on memory reconfiguration algorithms.

However, typical design practices used for super-threshold operation are not necessarily compatible with the low voltage regime. Here, radically different guidelines may be needed since existing process technologies have been optimized for super-threshold operation. We therefore study the selection of the optimal technology in ultra low voltage designs to achieve minimum energy and minimum variability which are among foremost concerns. We investigate five industrial technologies, from 250 nm to 65 nm. We demonstrate that mature technologies are often the best choice in very low voltage applications, saving as much as ~1800X in total energy consumption compared to a poorly selected technology. In parallel, the effect of technology choice on variability is investigated, when operating at the energy optimal design point. The results show up to a 4X improvement in delay variation due to global process shift and mismatch when using the most advanced technologies despite their large variability at nominal V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dd</sub>\n.","doi":"10.1145/1393921.1393930","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of the 13th international symposium on Low power electronics and design (ISLPED '08)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceeding of the 13th international symposium on Low power electronics and design (ISLPED '08)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5528413/5529013/05529079.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1393921.1393930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5529013","startPage":"9","endPage":"14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal technology selection for minimizing energy and variability in low voltage applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5529079","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal technology selection for minimizing energy and variability in low voltage applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5529079/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"11447810","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5529079/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal technology selection for minimizing energy and variability in low voltage applications","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"81090009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068862S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5528413","isNumber":"5529013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5528413","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5529013","articleId":"5529079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5529084,"authors":[{"name":"Pulkit Jain","affiliation":["Dept of ECE, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN"],"firstName":"Pulkit","lastName":"Jain","id":"37533768900"},{"name":"Tae-Hyoung Kim","affiliation":["Dept of ECE, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN"],"firstName":"Tae-Hyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37696639200"},{"name":"John Keane","affiliation":["Dept of ECE, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Keane","id":"37290192800"},{"name":"Chris H.

Telecommunications Infrastructure requires both backbone network and the last-mile access for enabling a country to have efficient telecom and Internet connectivity. There is a connectivity gap exists between the backbone network and the last-mile access network. To deliver the high-speed, last mile connectivity, we have proposed Free Space Optics (FSO). Free Space Optics (FSO) is one of the most promising new access technologies where optical transceivers transmit laser beams directly through the atmosphere to form point-to-point high-speed communications links.

Environmental condition, target characteristic and sensor efficiency are three parameters which can impress on sensor value in target recognition so for recognizing targets, a group of sensors which have more recognition rates, must be selected intelligently. Utilizing many sensors to acquire the highest object recognition rate would have extra cost and decrease energy of mobile sensors rapidly. Therefore make a tradeoff between sensor numbers and object recognition rate would be imperatively. This paper attempts to design a multi objective optimization service by using optimization algorithm and neural network. This service specifies highest recognition rate for each distinct sensor numbers. We propose multi objective optimization algorithm to help accessing the best sensory configuration for a definite environment regarding to the environmental conditions, sensors performance, and object features. Our multi objective optimization algorithm has two functions. Genetic algorithm is used to perform as one of functions to specify object recognition rates of each sensor group. Neural network is used to perform as fitness function of each genetic algorithm chromosomes. Another function is sensor numbers determinant. Highest recognition rate and lowest sensor numbers are two objects which multi objective optimization algorithm wants to make a balance between them. We define 500 different scenarios for 6 different sensors in different conditions. Object recognition rate of each sensor is collected. These rates are used for neural networks training process. By defining new scenario and run multi objective optimization algorithm in this scenario, this algorithm makes a Pareto front between sensor numbers and object recognition rate. Finally this algorithm finds, by distinct numbers of sensor, which sensors by which recognition ability must be used to reach the highest recognition rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICETC.2010.5529431","startPage":"V2-70","endPage":"V2-73","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Education Technology and Computer","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508190/5529317/05529431.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Education Technology and Computer","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETC.2010.5529431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5529317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi objective optimization for object recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object recognition","Intelligent sensors","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Target recognition","Neural networks","Character recognition","Design optimization","Genetic algorithms","Sensor fusion","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","neural nets","object recognition","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi objective optimization","object recognition","genetic algorithm","neural network","sensor fusion systems","Pareto"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic Sensor Management","Intelligent Sensor Selection","Objects Recognition Rate","multi objective optimization","Genetic Algorithm","Neural Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5529431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multi objective optimization for object recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5529431/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11522726","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi objective optimization for object recognition","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"rp019Vol2R256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071008S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508190","isNumber":"5529317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508190","xplore-issue":"5529317","articleId":"5529431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5529466,"authors":[{"name":"Craig K.

This compression is irreversible, and therefore allows the possibility that information relevant for performing a diagnostic task is irretrievably lost. The purpose of this study was to evaluate information transfer in beamforming using a previously developed ideal observer model to quantify diagnostic information relevant to performing a task. We describe an elaborated statistical model of image formation for fixed-focus transmission and single-channel reception within a moving aperture, and we use this model on a panel of tasks related to breast sonography to evaluate receive-beamforming approaches that optimize the transfer of information. Under the assumption that acquisition noise is well described as an additive wide-band Gaussian white-noise process, we show that signal compression across receive-aperture channels after a 2-D matched-filtering operation results in no loss of diagnostic information. Across tasks, the matched-filter beamformer results in more information than standard delay-and-sum beamforming in the subsequent radio-frequency signal by a factor of two. We also show that for this matched filter, 68% of the information gain can be attributed to the phase of the matched-filter and 21% can be attributed to the amplitude. A 1-D matched filtering along axial lines shows no advantage over delay-andsum, suggesting an important role for incorporating correlations across different aperture windows in beamforming. We also show that a post-compression processing before the computation of an envelope is necessary to pass the diagnostic information in the beamformed radio-frequency signal to the final envelope image.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5529466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11485872","htmlLink":"/document/5529466/","pubMedId":"20679007","displayDocTitle":"Optimal beamforming in ultrasound using the ideal observer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal beamforming in ultrasound using the ideal observer","sourcePdf":"t1081782.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066793S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5529451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5529451","articleId":"5529466","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5529527,"authors":[{"name":"Xinjian Qiang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Xi''an Shiyou University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Xinjian Qiang","id":"37087432809"},{"name":"Guojian Cheng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Xi''an Shiyou University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Guojian Cheng","id":"37087432834"},{"name":"Zheng Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Xi''an Shiyou University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Zheng Wang","id":"37087071643"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6370-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6367-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6369-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-1812"}],"articleNumber":"5529527","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":742},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5529527","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Network topology","Neurons","Poles and towers","Artificial neural networks","Unsupervised learning","Supervised learning","Computer networks","Computer science education","Educational technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network topology","neural nets","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural networks","growing neural networks","network topology","incremental learning","supervised learning","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["growing neural networks","constructive neural networks","supervised learning and unsupervised learning","self-organizing maps"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICETC.2010.5529527","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508190/5529481/05529527.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Education Technology and Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Education Technology and Computer","startPage":"V3-351","endPage":"V3-355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5529481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETC.2010.5529527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An overview of some classical Growing Neural Networks and new developments","abstract":"The mapping capability of artificial neural networks (ANN) is dependent on their structure, i.e., the number of layers and the number of hidden units. There is no formal way of computing network topology as a function of the complexity of a problem. It is usually selected by trial-and-error and can be rather time consuming. Basically, we make use of two mechanisms that may modify the topology of the network: growth and pruning. This paper gives an overview of some classical Growing Neural Networks (GNN) and their new developments. This kind of GNN is also called the ANN with incremental learning. Firstly, some classical GNN with supervised learning are outlined which includes tiling algorithm, tower algorithm, upstart algorithm, cascade-correlation algorithm, restricted coulomb energy network and resource-allocation network. Secondly, a class of classical GNN with unsupervised learning is reviewed, such as self-organizing surfaces, evolve self-organizing maps, incremental grid growing and growing hierarchical self-organizing map. Thirdly, the new developments of GNN, including both supervised learning and unsupervised learning, are surveyed. The conclusion is given at the end of the paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5529527/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11522870","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5529527/","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An overview of some classical Growing Neural Networks and new developments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An overview of some classical Growing Neural Networks and new developments","confLoc":"Shanghai","sourcePdf":"rp087Vol3R922.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083525S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508190","isNumber":"5529481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508190","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5529481","articleId":"5529527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5529535,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Li-zhong","affiliation":["ShiJiaZhuang College, ShiJiaZhuang, China"],"lastName":"Lin Li-zhong","id":"38273745800"},{"name":"Liu Zhi-guo","affiliation":["ShiJiaZhuang College, ShiJiaZhuang, China"],"lastName":"Liu Zhi-guo","id":"38277530100"},{"name":"Duan Xian-hui","affiliation":["ShiJiaZhuang College, ShiJiaZhuang, China"],"lastName":"Duan Xian-hui","id":"38274553000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6370-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6367-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6369-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-1812"}],"articleNumber":"5529535","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":385},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Neural networks","Computer networks","Feedforward neural networks","Educational institutions","Probes","Neurons","Computer science education","Educational technology","Feedforward systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","radial basis function networks","rough set theory","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rough set","RBF neural network","computer network","network intrusion detection method","KDD-CUP99","DoS fault data","U2R fault data","probe fault data","R2L fault data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RBF neural network","network intrusion","rough set","fault data"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5529535","abstract":"In order to detect the intrusion for computer network accurately, the network intrusion detection method should be developed continuously.

Grid management resources does as a diagnostic and assigning resources scheduling and resource monitoring in grid. Scheduling process directs tasks to suitable resources. It must take place somehow that load work distributed equally on resources to get the maximum interest out of existed resource, establishing load balancing is one the important performance factors in grid resource management efficiency. in this paper, a model in accordance with tree and probabilistic scheduling algorithms with load balancing purpose was suggested, that in this algorithm class of work, cost, deadline and herd behavior have considered. We investigate the probability of a resource success in different algorithms in accordance with complete time, execute time and cost. Probabilistic algorithms chooses the resources that have better past and leave the duties to it, in case of execution or non-execution on the resource the source will give a reward or punishment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5529642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5529642/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11522980","isConference":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Investigating of probabilistic load balancing algorithms in grid computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigating of probabilistic load balancing algorithms in grid computing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"rp109Vol4R1527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065014S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508190","isNumber":"5529615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508190","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5529615","articleId":"5529642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5529660,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Min","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Weinan Teachers University, Weinan, Shanxi, China"],"lastName":"Wang Min","id":"37398737200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6370-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6367-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6369-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-1812"}],"articleNumber":"5529660","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":519},"abstract":"Based on the introduction of the simple selection sort algorithm, this paper analyzes in detail two bidirectional selection sort algorithm design ideas, gives individually the algorithm description in C, and corrects the oversights about the algorithm description in some reference papers.

of complex method, then it uses genetic algorithm to find the optimal solution. When termination conditions are met, complex method is used to get the final result. Experiment has been conducted to validate the propoesd algorithm by taking optimization formula system as an example.

Under this setting, a theoretical benchmark receiver is analyzed, the maximum possible diversity order attainable is derived to be L\u03b1/2, where L is the number of antennas and \u03b1 is the characteristic exponent of the noise. Moreover, trade-offs between the diversity gain and the array gain have been identified. The conventional linear matched filter receiver (also known as maximum ratio combining in the Gaussian case) has been shown to have a diversity order of \u03b1/2, thereby not benefiting from spatial diversity. Closed form expressions for the diversity gain and array gain of post-detection combining have been derived. As an improvement to conventional combining schemes, the optimum maximum likelihood detector is derived. A simpler high SNR approximation of the detector is shown to not depend on the noise parameters, and is compared to the generalized Cauchy detector under stable noise. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to supplement our analytical results and compare the performance of the detectors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5529753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5529753/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11533613","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Diversity Combining over Rayleigh Fading Channels with Symmetric Alpha-Stable Noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity Combining over Rayleigh Fading Channels with Symmetric Alpha-Stable Noise","sourcePdf":"2968-tw1009-rajan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097024S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5578601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5578601","articleId":"5529753","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5529755,"authors":[{"name":"Norman C.

This detector is analyzed theoretically and verified through realistic open-source simulations using actual digital television signals captured in the US.

Instead of assuming a large number of users to obtain a scaling law as most current work, we derive the sum rate formulas of the ZF MIMO broadcast systems with a small number of scheduled users. By analysis and simulations, we find that when taking the variations of feedback channel into account, the receive ZF MIMO broadcast system is more robust to feedback errors and can deliver equal or even higher sum rate than the transmit ZF MIMO broadcast system. We discuss whether a feedback channel is suitable to send channel state information (CSI) for calculating transmit antenna beamforming weights, or suitable to send CSI for selecting users in the receive ZF MIMO broadcast system. Our results show that as the variation of feedback channel errors increases from 0.5 to 1.5, the receive ZF 3 \u00d7 3 MIMO broadcast system can provide 36% to 116% higher sum rate than the transmit ZF 3 \u00d7 3 MIMO broadcast system in the case of 20 users at signal to noise ratio (SNR) equal to 20 dB. Providing that more feedback bandwidth and an error-free feedback channel are available, the transmit ZF MIMO broadcast system can achieve higher sum rate than the receive ZF MIMO broadcast system.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.072110.081226","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5578601/05529760.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.072110.081226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578601","startPage":"2779","endPage":"2791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling for Multiuser MIMO Broadcast Systems: Transmit or Receive Beamforming?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5529760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling for Multiuser MIMO Broadcast Systems: Transmit or Receive Beamforming?","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5529760/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11527913","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5529760/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling for Multiuser MIMO Broadcast Systems: Transmit or Receive Beamforming?","sourcePdf":"2779-tw1009-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156584S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5578601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5578601","articleId":"5529760","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5529761,"authors":[{"name":"Soomin Ko","affiliation":["school of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5578601/5529761/5529761-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Soomin Ko received the B.S. degrees in electrical engineering in 2006 from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science.

The two schemes are designed to select either the selective feedback (SF) mode which feeds back the fine-grained condition of a part of the channels or the bit-map based feedback (BF) mode which feeds back the coarse-grained condition of all the channels using 1 bit for each channel, depending on the channel conditions of the users. Specifically, the NMF scheme makes the BS determine the more desirable feedback mode by predicting and comparing the average total throughputs of the two modes for the given statistical channel characteristics of the users. The UMF scheme makes each user determine its own feedback mode based on both its channel realization and the recommendation of the network. Numerical results reveal that the proposed NMF and UMF schemes achieve significant performance gain over the existing feedback reduction schemes with similar feedback load.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.072110.091407","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5578601/05529761.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.072110.091407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578601","startPage":"2842","endPage":"2852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mode Selection-Based Channel Feedback Reduction Schemes for Opportunistic Scheduling in OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5529761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mode Selection-Based Channel Feedback Reduction Schemes for Opportunistic Scheduling in OFDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5529761/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11527908","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5529761/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode Selection-Based Channel Feedback Reduction Schemes for Opportunistic Scheduling in OFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"2842-tw1009-ko.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071325S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5578601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5578601","articleId":"5529761","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5529762,"authors":[{"name":"Duc To","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Swansea University, Swansea, UK"],"firstName":"Duc","lastName":"To","id":"37541907200"},{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Swansea University, Swansea, UK"],"firstName":"Jinho","lastName":"Choi","id":"37280083000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5529762","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1255},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5529762","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolutional codes","Relays","Network coding","Maximum likelihood decoding","Viterbi algorithm","Broadcasting","Protocols","Diversity methods","Fading","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","diversity reception","fading channels","maximum likelihood decoding","network coding","trellis codes","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","two-way relay networks","physical-layer network coding","relay node decode","source nodes","Viterbi algorithm","maximum likelihood decoding","XORed messages","two-user decoding","low complexity decoding","reduced-state trellis","diversity gain","fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-way relay network","physical-layer network coding (PNC)","multiple access channel","convolutional code","Viterbi algorithm"]}],"abstract":"We study the application of convolutional codes to two-way relay networks (TWRNs) with physical-layer network coding (PNC).

In this setup, for given memory length constraint, the two source nodes can choose the same convolutional code that has the largest free distance in order to maximize the performance. Motivated from the fact that the relay node only needs to decode XORed messages, a low complexity decoding scheme is proposed using a reduced-state trellis.

The hardware keystone is the transponder's radio wake-up transceiver, which is a single oscillator with very low power consumption. The communication protocol, based on frequency signalling binary tree, contributes to the low complexity of the tag architecture. More than 1500 tags can be read per second. The average transponder ID read-out delay is 319 ms when there are 1000 transponders within reach of the interrogator.

Assuming that arbitrarily distributed RFID tags, containing their exact positions given in latitude, longitude and elevation, are read out by the reader, the system is able to achieve the tags positions. In that case, the reader is able to evaluate and forward the readout positions in order to notify a superior navigation system of the estimated position, obtained from the RFID tags.

This system is ideal for use in credit cards and similar identification cards which are based on \"data transfer by contact\" which at present uses the conventional using integrated circuits (IC) or magnetic strips. The system consists of the design of a compatible low cost tag as well as the measurement set up using a metallic cavity. Using the presented technique it is easily possible to code 23 bits within the dimensions of a conventional credit card. Emphasis is given to security as well as larger data capability. It can be seen that the presented technique is robust and cost effective compared to the existing techniques and can be used as a viable alternative in identification cards based on data transfer by contact.","doi":"10.1109/RFID-TA.2010.5529879","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on RFID-Technology and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on RFID-Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510906/5529839/05529879.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFID-TA.2010.5529879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5529839","startPage":"159","endPage":"163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New RF identification technology for secure applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5529879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New RF identification technology for secure applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5529879/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11455188","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5529879/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New RF identification technology for secure applications","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"10110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039726S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510906","isNumber":"5529839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510906","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5529839","articleId":"5529879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5529922,"authors":[{"name":"Stevan Preradovic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Stevan","lastName":"Preradovic","id":"37298748900"},{"name":"Nemai Karmakar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Nemai","lastName":"Karmakar","id":"37279066400"},{"name":"Michael Zenere","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Zenere","id":"37546876900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6700-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6697-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6699-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6698-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5529922","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["RFID tags","Radiofrequency identification","Resonance","Horn antennas","Radio frequency","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Phase detection","Attenuation","Plastics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["horn antennas","radiofrequency identification","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB chipless tag RFID reader design","cross-polarized reader horn antennas","spectral signatures","phase jumps","UWB spectrum","conveyor belt systems"]}],"abstract":"A chipless tag RFID reader is presented for short range applications. The RFID reader is comprised of a digital section, RF section and cross-polarized reader horn antennas. The reader horn antennas are used to transmit and receive data to and from the chipless tags respectively. The chipless tags have unique spectral signatures which correspond to resonances present at different frequencies in the spectrum. Each resonance has a 1:1 correspondence with a data bit. The chiplesss tag RFID reader detects the resonances as attenuation in the magnitude and phase-jumps in the phase of the spectrum. The RFID reader operates in the UWB spectrum (between 5 and 10.7 GHz) and can successfully detect a chipless tag at close range. The tag design can be transferred easily to plastic and paper, making it suitable for mass deployment for low cost items in trillions. The RFID reader is suitable for mounting over conveyor belt systems.","doi":"10.1109/RFID-TA.2010.5529922","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on RFID-Technology and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on RFID-Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510906/5529839/05529922.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFID-TA.2010.5529922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5529839","startPage":"257","endPage":"262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UWB chipless tag RFID reader design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5529922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"UWB chipless tag RFID reader design","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5529922/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11455195","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5529922/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UWB chipless tag RFID reader design","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"10137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05302S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510906","isNumber":"5529839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510906","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5529839","articleId":"5529922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"}]
